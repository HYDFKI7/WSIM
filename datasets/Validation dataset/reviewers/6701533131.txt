1842736547	The Quality of Footwear Fit: What we know, don't know and should know	Even though fit ranks as one of the most important considerations in the purchase of a shoe, the quality of fit has no metric and is hence poorly assessed. Manufacturers, retailers, and customers tend to use trial and error techniques to improve footwear fit. This approach is rather cumbersome and very unscientific. In this paper, we present a methodology to assess and thereby quantify footwear fit so that comfort can be predicted and consequently improved lasts and shoes can be produced that match different shapes of feet.

21844460792	3D foot shape generation from 2D information	Two methods to generate an individual 3D foot shape from 2D information are proposed. A standard foot shape was first generated and then scaled based on known 2D information. In the first method, the foot outline and the foot height were used, and in the second, the foot outline and the foot profile were used. The models were developed using 40 participants and then validated using a different set of 40 participants. Results show that each individual foot shape can be predicted within a mean absolute error of 1.36 mm for the left foot and 1.37 mm for the right foot using the first method, and within a mean absolute error of 1.02 min for the left foot and 1.02 mm for the right foot using the second method. The second method shows somewhat improved accuracy even though it requires two images. Both the methods are relatively cheaper than using a scanner to determine the 3D foot shape for custom footwear design. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

0032442651	Effectiveness of menu orientation in Chinese	Graphical user interface guidelines have been developed predominantly in English-speaking countries, but aspects related to culture (e.g., local metaphors, symbols, color, and flow) are not universal and have received little or no attention. Even though the reading and writing flow of languages such as English, Japanese, and Chinese differ widely, most software interfaces do not take account of this. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of menu flow or menu orientation in both the Chinese and English languages for Chinese users. The experimental results indicate that for the Chinese population, a horizontal menu in either language is more effective than the vertical orientation. Thus item differentiation in menus is best performed when the natural flow of the user's native language is broken through a transformation process similar to a matrix transpose. Even though we did not investigate search strategies explicitly, we hypothesize that the primary reason for the difference lies in the scanning patterns adopted by the Chinese population in search tasks so that there is no mismatch in the reading metaphors. Applications of this research include the design of culturally and linguistically adapted human-computer interfaces for Chinese users.

33746310401	A heuristic-based approach to optimize keyboard design for single-finger keying applications	With the popularity of mobile devices, designing a keyboard for users who can only operate with a pointer or the eyes is a challenging task. In this paper we present a methodology and keyboard designs that attempt to optimize the key arrangement so that movement time, as defined by Fitts' law, is minimized. Numerical simulations show that the present day keyboards and arrangements are not optimal for such applications. Three keyboard shapes, which included an existing design and two others were selected based on symmetry and compactness and were compared with two soft keyboards, FITALY and Metropolis. An integer programming model was formulated considering the character transition frequency of words in the English language. The problem was solved using a simulated annealing heuristic. One of the proposed designs called "YLAROF" with a rectangular design and a symmetric layout with characters laid in an "I" shape showed stable and consistent performance, when tested with 20 test cases. Relevance to industry: When holding a mobile device, only one hand or one pointer is available for data input. Thus, it is important to minimize movement time in order to improve performance and minimize potential fatigue. The methodology presented and the proposed keyboard designs can be used and configured in existing products quite easily. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33748297525	Foot measurements from three-dimensional scans: A comparison and evaluation of different methods	An approach to automatic foot measurement using 3D scanned data is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach was evaluated through comparisons of simulated measurements (SM) of eleven male and nine female participants with manual measurements (MM) and with the output of a commercially available automated foot measuring system (CP). The registration procedure for the measurements and unambiguous definitions for each measurement were first established. Eighteen dimensions of each foot were calculated from the scanned data that comprised point clouds and selected landmarks. Two operators manually measured each participant's foot twice. These MM showed high inter- and intra-operator reliability (ICC>0.84). Ten of the 18 dimensions obtained from the three measurement methods, SM, CP, and MM, were subjected to an ANOVA and eight of the measurements showed significant differences among the three methods. After establishing a linear correction to adjust for systematic errors, there were no significant differences between the SM and MM methods for 17 of the 18 foot dimensions; and the single exception was the heel width dimension. The differences among the three methods, correction procedures and their significance are discussed. Relevance to industry: Measuring feet to obtain the relevant dimensions that characterize feet can be quite tedious and the measurement may be dependent on the measurer. Automatic measurement with scanned data, on the other hand, can give replicable information even though the measurements depend on the intricacies of the scanning system and the computational algorithms adopted. The proposed definitions and algorithms provide a means to automate foot measurements for customized footwear. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34347346006	A qualitative study on the comfort and fit of ladies' dress shoes	The perceived differences between comfortable and uncomfortable shoes and the fit preferences in the different regions of ladies' shoes were explored. Twenty Hong Kong Chinese females participated in the study. Each participant wore and rated the different aspects of their own comfortable and uncomfortable shoes. The Wilcoxon signed rank tests showed significant differences in ten perceived characteristics between the comfortable and uncomfortable shoes. Among the ten were tactile, auditory and olfactory sensations. The ten items reliably (Cronbach alpha>0.9) distinguished between comfortable and uncomfortable shoes. There were no significant differences between comfortable and uncomfortable shoes for aesthetic-related characteristics. Further analysis on the fit ratings showed a significant impact on the fit preferences in the Toe region (p<0.0001), Metatarsophalangeal (MPJ) region (p<0.0001), Arch region (p=0.002) and Ingress/egress opening (p<0.001). Knowing the preferred type of fit can help establish a specification for comfortable shoes and also brings out the criteria that a comfortable shoe does not necessarily have the same perceived fit in every region of a shoe. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0032771115	Footwear cushioning: Relating objective and subjective measurements	Footwear cushioning was evaluated objectively using an impact tester and related to perceived levels of cushioning (PLC). To evaluate the perceived levels of cushioning during standing, walking, and running, 3 experiments were conducted with 20 participants in each experiment. A 7-point subjective rating scale was used to rate the perceived levels of cushioning. At the end of the experiment, the subjective perceptions of cushioning were also recorded. During standing and running, the perceived level of cushioning can be predicted from the time to peak deceleration and/or stiffness (or compression). During walking, however, the magnitude of the peak deceleration on the impact tester appears to be a good predictor of PLC. Impact characterizations can reveal important differences between materials and how they are perceived during activity. In addition, the results seem to explain and link the differences that exist in the ergonomics and biomechanics literature on cushioning. Applications of this research include the design and selection of materials for footwear, floor mats, and other supporting surfaces.

0033513281	Foot flare and foot axis	Most commercial footwear is designed and manufactured on a curved last, although the amount of curvature of the last and the turning point of the last centerline have not been formally determined. In this study, we used principal component analysis to determine the foot axis so that lasts that match feet can be produced, resulting in a good fit. In evaluating 50 Hong Kong Chinese participants, we found that the center of the foot is located at approximately 52% of the foot length measuring from the back of the foot (SD = 0.65%) and that Hong Kong participants have a mean inflare (inward curvature) of 3.2°. The foot center and inflare measures will help determine the fit between footwear and feet. Applications of this research include the ability to incorporate foot flare into the design and manufacture of footwear.

0032823642	Legality of bowling actions in cricket	An ergonomic methodology has been designed and developed to evaluate the legality of bowling actions in cricket. This paper describes the methodology and a case study related to an international cricket player with an unorthodox bowling action. Objective measurements were used to evaluate the action. An electrogoniometer and a force-sensing resistor (FSR) were used for this purpose. The electrogoniometer measured the elbow angles in the sagittal plane, while the FSR indicated the instant of ball release to assess the presence of any elbow `straightening' directly preceding delivery. The FSR was attached to a finger depending on the type of ball delivered. Angles and forces were sampled in 500 Hz and stored in a data logger. The information collected was downloaded on to a computer for further analyses. The angle information preceding ball release is a clear indicator of arm `straightening' during bowling. The methodology has high reliability and accuracy in the evaluation of the legitimacy of bowling actions as defined by the International Cricket Council laws.

38849127529	Computerized girth determination for custom footwear manufacture	Good fitting footwear requires matching not just the linear dimensions of feet but their girths as well. Footwear fitters have been using manual measurements for a long time, but the development of computerized techniques and scanner technologies have now made automatic determination of different foot dimensions feasible. The resistance to using such computer measurements has been the lack of trust in the accuracy of the data. This paper proposes an approach to obtain the necessary girths of feet in order to customize footwear. The proposed approach attempts to simulate the manual measurement procedures, and its effectiveness is assessed through an experiment with 15 foot castings. The results show that the simulated measurements can be within 5 mm of the manual measurements if the measuring locations can be correctly identified. Linear regressions show that the differences between the manual measurements and the simulated measurements can be modeled with the addition of a systematic error term of less than 4 mm. The computerized acquisition of foot dimensions is a useful way forward for custom shoe manufacturers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40749138671	Partial surface reconstruction and applications from point cloud using RBF	An approach is proposed for partial surface reconstruction from point cloud using RBF. Traditionally RBF based shape approximation method is used for entire object, but in many applications only partial part of the points needs to be reconstructed. Our method first transforms the partial point cloud with PCA, then generates off-surface points by plane fitting for the local neighborhood of each point. The implicit surface is generated with constructed RBF while the surface edge is constrained by checking whether the marching cube is within the points' range, and octree-based subdivision is also used to speed the procedure. The proposed approach can reconstruct partial surface with constrained edge in much less computational time, and its efficiency is tested with experiments on different point clouds.

80052943562	Getting to the bottom of footwear customization	Footwear have been evaluated mostly using commercially available products, while some researchers have used custom shoes. Hence, the understanding of the effects of various parameters of a shoe is quite limited. The footbed simulator invented in recent years allows a range of parameters to be studied in quiet standing. It can be used to evaluate perceived feel and center of pressure changes to changes in heel height, seat length, material, wedge angle and toe spring. This paper is meant to show the value of the footbed simulator in terms of research and the actual production of shoes. A study performed with two heel heights, three combinations of seat length and material and three wedge angles showed that the perceived feel is closely related to the center of pressure. The results also show the optimum footbed has a significantly different perceived feel. Thus, the footbed simulator is an ideal way to generate custom footwear designs. © 2011 Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

44349151682	Midfoot shape when standing on soft and hard footbeds	In this study, the plantar shape of the midfoot was determined when the participants were standing on three different surfaces. Foot impression castings of sixteen participants were made when they were standing on a custom-made device. These castings were laser scanned in order to quantify the shape differences. The results showed that, when the amount of cushioning on the support surface was changed, the plantar mid-foot sag changed by 5.0 mm. The results have important implications for footwear design as midfoot shapes in footwear are somewhat standardized and are not adjusted to account for the cushioning properties of the footbed. The mismatched deformations between feet and shoes as a result of design, structure and material used in the heel and forefoot regions of shoes can contribute to unwanted strain on the plantar fascia of the human foot.

4644271373	Foot shape modeling	This study is an attempt to show how a "standard" foot can be parameterized using foot length, foot width, foot height, and a measure of foot curvature so that foot shape can be predicted using these simple anthropometric measures. The prediction model was generated using 40 Hong Kong Chinese men, and the model was validated using a different group of 25 Hong Kong Chinese men. The results show that each individual foot shape may be predicted to a mean accuracy of 2.1 mm for the left foot and 2.4 mm for the right foot. Application of this research includes the potential design and development of custom footwear without the necessity of expensive 3-D scanning of feet.

48249158328	Modelling foot height and foot shape-related dimensions	The application of foot anthropometry to design good-fitting footwear has been difficult due to the lack of generalised models. This study seeks to model foot dimensions so that the characteristic shapes of feet, especially in the midfoot region, can be understood. Fifty Hong Kong Chinese adults (26 males and 24 females) participated in this study. Their foot lengths, foot widths, ball girths and foot heights were measured and then evaluated using mathematical models. The results showed that there were no significant allometry (p> 0.05) effects of foot length on ball girth and foot width. Foot height showed no direct relationship with foot length. However, a normalisation with respect to foot length and foot height resulted in a significant relationship for both males and females with R2 greater than 0.97. Due to the lack of a direct relationship between foot height and foot length, the current practice of grading shoes with a constant increase in height or proportionate scaling in response to foot length is less than ideal. The results when validated with other populations can be a significant way forward in the design of footwear that has an improved fit in the height dimension.

5144234992	Dimensional differences for evaluating the quality of footwear fit	Very few standards exist for fitting products to people. Footwear is a noteworthy example. This study is an attempt to evaluate the quality of footwear fit using two-dimensional foot outlines. Twenty Hong Kong Chinese students participated in an experiment that involved three pairs of dress shoes and one pair of athletic shoes. The participants' feet were scanned using a commercial laser scanner, and each participant wore and rated the fit of each region of each shoe. The shoe lasts were also scanned and were used to match the foot scans with the last scans. The ANOVA showed significant (p < 0.05) differences among the four pairs of shoes for the overall, fore-foot and rear-foot fit ratings. There were no significant differences among shoes for mid-foot fit rating. These perceived differences were further analysed after matching the 2D outlines of both last and feet. The pointwise dimensional difference between foot and shoe outlines were computed and analysed after normalizing with foot perimeter. The dimensional difference (DD) plots along the foot perimeter showed that fore-foot fit was strongly correlated (R

56949088414	Effects of pen design on drawing and writing performance	Two experiments are reported with the aim of determining the effect of pen shape and size on two different types of task: drawing and writing. Experiment 1 attempted to determine the optimum shape and size of shank for ball-point pens used to perform an accurate drawing task. Twenty-seven participants used a total of nine different pens. Drawing performance was measured by having the subjects follow mazes of different size. The dependent variables were drawing movement time and drawing accuracy. The results indicate that the pen with an equivalent diameter of 8 mm had the best accuracy during drawing, even though it had the lowest speed. The results confirm the applicability and validity of the Drury tracking model for such a task. Even though users tended to prefer larger pens, their accuracy with such pens tended to be low. In a second experiment, subjects performed a writing task (with no accuracy constraints) and rated their preference for types of pen. An attempt was made to determine the preferred dimensions of ball-point pens for writing in Chinese and English. A total of 36 'bare-bodied' pens and 20 Chinese subjects were used to evaluate the effects of shape, size and weight on time to write a sentence. The Writing Ability, Comfort and an Overall Rating were given by the subjects. The results indicate that the Chinese subjects preferred a circular shaped pen for writing in both languages. A factor analysis showed that speed, comfort and writing ability are independent parameters in pen evaluations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

56949098046	Effects of surface characteristics on the plantar shape of feet and subjects' perceived sensations	Orthotics and other types of shoe inserts are primarily designed to reduce injury and improve comfort. The interaction between the plantar surface of the foot and the load-bearing surface contributes to foot and surface deformations and hence to perceived comfort, discomfort or pain. The plantar shapes of 16 participants' feet were captured when standing on three support surfaces that had different cushioning properties in the mid-foot region. Foot shape deformations were quantified using 3D laser scans. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the participant's perceptions of perceived shape and perceived feeling. The results showed that the structure in the mid-foot could change shape, independent of the rear-foot and forefoot regions. Participants were capable of identifying the shape changes with distinct preferences towards certain shapes. The cushioning properties of the mid-foot materials also have a direct influence on perceived feelings. This research has strong implications for the design and material selection of orthotics, insoles and footwear. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

60149108486	Pistol shooting accuracy as dependent on experience, eyes being opened and available viewing time	A study of the shooting accuracy of three groups of pistol shooters is reported. The groups included (i) experienced gas pistol shooters; (ii) persons with experience in video shooting games; and (iii) persons with no shooting experience. The viewing time was varied in the tests. The results showed that experience had a significant effect on the mean and root mean square (RMS) shooting errors at the target. The results also showed that the viewing time does not need to exceed about 2 s for an experienced pistol shooter and about 3 s for a novice shooter to reach the best performance. Two models for the effects of limited viewing time are proposed; both models fit the data well when the viewing time is less than about 2 s. The results indicated that the differences occurring with varying levels of experience are due to postural balance and not due to the aiming or cognitive component of the task. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

67349239412	Hand-skin temperature and tracking performance	Even though manual tracking performance has been extensively investigated, there is little or no research related to the lower limit of temperature for unimpaired tracking performance. This study sought to obtain temperature limits while investigating the effect of hand-skin temperature on manual tracking. Eighteen subjects participated in a within-subject design experiment. The hand-skin temperatures corresponded to bath temperatures of 10, 20 and 30 °C. Tracking performance was measured using the Drury [1971. Movements with lateral constraint. Ergonomics 14(2), 293-305] task of drawing between two continuous straight lines of length 200 mm and widths 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 4 mm. Performance measures were the time to draw the line and the number of errors as determined by the cross-over points of the drawn line with the printed lines. Both performance measures were consistent and showed significant effects (p<.05) of line spacing and hand-skin temperature. Performance with bath temperatures of 10 °C was significantly worse than that with bath temperatures of 20 and 30 °C. Relevance to Industry: Workers are exposed to cold temperatures in numerous ways. Even though personal protective equipment can be used to minimize cold exposure, in tasks such as hand/arm tracking, performance decrements can be quite significant when wearing gloves or other protective equipment. Hence, it is important to identify the cold-limiting temperatures and task characteristics beyond which identifiable decrements of performance exist so that appropriate tasks can be designed for individuals, depending on the existing temperatures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

68349127092	Footbed shapes for enhanced footwear comfort	A shoe wearer's comfort is related to the shape of the footbed of a shoe. Even though the footbed shape is important in footwear design, there exists no methodology to evaluate the existing guidelines used in last making. Thirty-two females participated in an experiment where heel seat length, heel seat inclination and heel height were investigated using the profile assessment device. The dependent variables were plantar pressure and perceived feeling of each participant. The results show that perceived feel is best for wedge angles of 4° and 5° at a heel height of 25 mm, 10° and 11° at a heel height of 50 mm and 16° and 18° at a heel height of 75 mm. A regression model was derived and this explained approximately 80% of the variation of perceived feeling with the contact area, peak plantar pressure and percentage of force acting on the forefoot region. Both heel wedge angle and heel seat length play an important role in the perceived feel of high-heeled shoes. This study, in relation to the load-bearing heel part of a shoe, highlights the importance of good footbed design. The findings can be used to design footwear with enhanced comfort.

70350303909	Foot deformations under different load-bearing conditions and their relationships to stature and body weight	Footwear comfort is primarily determined by the fit between the foot and the shoe. Foot deformations that cannot be accommodated by the flexibility of the material of the shoe upper have to be dealt with by other adaptive means. The major purpose of this study was to determine foot deformations using nine foot dimensions-foot length, arch length, foot width, midfoot width, heel width, midfoot height, medial malleolus height of the most protruding point, lateral malleolus height of the most protruding point and ball girth-as well as the eversion/inversion of the foot while bearing weight. Each foot of 30 Hong Kong Chinese adults (15 males and 15 females) was laser scanned under the conditions of no body-weight (NWB), half body-weight (HWB) and full body-weight (FWB). The nine dimensions and foot rotation were determined with a computer program. The results show that the foot became significantly longer, wider, and reduced in height while everting with increased loading on the foot. The midfoot had relatively large changes in width and height when compared to the forefoot and rearfoot. Even though there were no obvious patterns between the left and right foot for both males and females, considerable differences did exist between the two feet of a few participants. Foot length as a percentage of stature changed from 14.94% to 15.10% to 15.13% in males as the load on the foot increased from NWB to HWB to FWB, respectively. These percentages were 14.56%, 14.72%, and 14.77% for females. Even though foot width was significantly correlated with the body weight of males, no such relationship exists in Hong Kong females. © 2009 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.

70350341747	The pluses and minuses of obtaining measurements from digital scans	Digital scanners are commonplace and are used in many different applications to obtain three-dimensional shapes and linear and circumferential measurements. Even though scanners can be highly accurate, measurements obtained from scanners can vary depending on how an object is scanned, aligned and processed. In this study, we examined the effect of three different alignment methods of foot scans and their effects on ten different measurements. Variations among methods in capturing foot length are relatively small relative to arch length. The foot girths can be quite sensitive to the registration process depending on the complexity of the algorithms used. As expected, linear and girth measurements based on anatomical landmarks will always be independent of any registration process and are thus good ways to obtain repeatable measurements. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

0035125825	A methodology to determine the optimum seat depth	Even though the seat pan carries most of the weight during sitting, the number of studies investigating the different aspects of the sitting area are limited. Seat depth has been based on anthropometry or the so-called industry practice. The relevance of the widely used seat depth measure is thus questionable. A methodology has been developed to evaluate the useful seat depth for a target population. The methodology is found to be reliable and valid based on both objective and subjective measurements. A chair with an 'adjustable' seat depth was designed and developed for this purpose. A total of 30 Chinese students were tested. The objective measure was the seat edge protrusion when seated. Eight seat features were rated using a 5-point scale. The results show that the seat depth's of 30.4 and 38cm are significantly different, with the seat depth of 38cm being on the 'long side'. In addition, the objective measure of seat edge protrusion indicated that a seat depth of 31-33cm is adequate for the South China region Chinese population. Based on the subjective ratings and the objective measure developed, it may be concluded that a seat depth of 31-33cm is appropriate for the same population. Relevance to industry - Anthropometry alone is not sufficient for the design of seats. The differing sensitivity in the buttock and thigh areas is an indication that chairs should be designed and selected depending on the population under consideration. The need for having chairs of variable depth has to be recognized especially during long periods of sitting. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0035134117	Simplified subjective workload assessment technique	Although the subjective workload assessment technique (SWAT) has been widely used, it has two main problems: It is not very sensitive for low mental workloads and it requires a time-consuming card sorting pretask procedure. In this study are presented five variations of SWAT in an effort to overcome the limitations. Four of the variants used the continuous SWAT subscales while one used the discrete SWAT subscale. Fifteen subjects participated in the experiment. The scales were compared with the original SWAT scale in terms of sensitivity and pretask procedure completion time when performing arithmetic tasks. The results show that all four variants are more sensitive than the conventional SWAT scale and that the pairwise comparison procedure takes significantly less pretask completion time compared with the original SWAT scale. Thus, the conventional pretask procedure can be replaced by a simple unweighted averaging to yield a scale of high sensitivity.

76949103011	Foot arch characterization: A review, a new metric, and a comparison	Background: The medial longitudinal arch of the foot is important because it helps protect the foot from injury. Researchers have developed many measures to quantify the characteristics of the arch, and there is ongoing debate about the suitability of these different metrics. This article compares the various measures related to the foot arch, including a new metric, the midfoot dorsal angle, and then investigates the differences in the dimensional measures among various foot types. Methods: The right feet of 48 healthy individuals (24 men and 24 women) were measured, and various metrics, including the arch height index, the navicular height to arch length ratio, the arch index, the footprint index, the subjective ranking, the modified arch index, the malleolar valgus index, and the midfoot dorsal angle, were determined. Results: Correlation analyses showed that the arch index obtained from the inked footprint has a moderate to high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficients >0.50) with all measured foot-type metrics except for the malleolar valgus index. There were no differences in participant age, stature, weight, body mass index, foot length, foot width, and midfoot height among high, normal, and low foot arches. However, the high-arched group had significantly shorter arch lengths but larger navicular heights and higher midfoot dorsal angles compared with the low-arched group. There were differences in force distributions and peak pressures as well. The rearfoot had more loading and greater peak pressure whereas the midfoot had less load in the high-arched group compared with the low-arched group. Conclusions: The midfoot dorsal angle may be an appropriate metric for characterizing the foot arch because it is quick and easy to measure, without the tedious procedures associated with area calculations and dimension measurements.

77949520865	A turning function based approach for foot outline classification	This study introduces a turning function based technique to classify foot outlines. Foot scans from ten males and ten females were obtained using a laser scanner. The similarities among the different foot shapes were assessed based on the Euclidean distance between turning functions. Thereafter, average linkage clustering was used to classify the differing foot outlines. Two distinct shape groups emerged for both medial and lateral sides. The presence or absence of a medial bulge results in two clusters on the medial side. Similarly, a narrow lateral side with more concavity and a wider lateral side in the midfoot region are the two clusters for the lateral side. More males (60%) showed a bulge on the medial side. The group that belongs to the narrower lateral side were predominantly females (70%). These differences in the structure of the clusters were reflected in the lack of a correlation between the medial and lateral side clusters. ©2009 IEEE.

77951050603	The relationship between monochronicity, polychronicity and individual characteristics	With the increasing complexity of control rooms and the information explosion, effective multitasking is now desired. Monochronicity and polychronicity, which describe a person's ability to do one thing and many things at a time, respectively, have been studied for a long time. However, it is not clear these abilities are related to various individual characteristics. Forty-eight Chinese participants were tested on their perception, memory, judgement, attention ability and cognitive style. They also performed a task that required search and calculation under three conditions of unpaced, paced and paced with sequencing. There were significant differences in the performance and strategy between monochronic and polychronic individuals in the selective attention test. Monochronic individuals focused their attention on the primary task and achieved higher performance. Polychronic individuals had somewhat better total performance in more than one task under time-constrained conditions. The results clearly indicate that an individual's time use behaviours ought to be considered in training and control scenarios to account for differences among people. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

77952925571	An automatic method of measuring foot girths for custom footwear using local RBF implicit surfaces	Three-dimensional point cloud data of a foot are used to determine the critical dimensions for making custom footwear. However, automatic and accurate measurement of dimensions, especially girths, is an issue of concern to many designers and footwear developers. Existing methods for measuring girths are primarily based on points or generated triangles, but their accuracy is heavily dependent on the density of the point cloud data. In this paper we present the use of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) surface modelling technique for measuring girths as it has the advantage of being able to operate on unorganised three-dimensional points, so that the generated surface passes through every scanned point, while repairing incomplete meshes. To overcome the high computational expense of the RBF method, local surface recovery, octree division and combination, inverse power method and improved Cholesky factorisation are used. The girth measurements obtained from adopting these approaches are compared against the existing measurement methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the local RBF implicit surface can provide more stable and accurate measurements using relatively less time, proving its value in custom footwear manufacture. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

78149483437	An indentation apparatus for evaluating discomfort and pain thresholds in conjunction with mechanical properties of foot tissue in vivo	The mechanical properties of human foot tissue in vivo as well as discomfort and pain thresholds are important for various applications. In this study, an apparatus for measuring the discomfort and pain thresholds and the mechanical properties of human tissues is presented. The apparatus employs a stepper motor that controls the indentation speed, as well as a load cell and potentiometer that determine the corresponding reaction force and tissue deformation (displacement), respectively. A LabVIEW program (LabVIEW 8, National Instruments Corporation; Austin, Texas) was developed to control the indentation via a data acquisition card. The apparatus can accommodate indentor displacements up to 35 mm and can impart forces up to 150 N at a controlled indentation speed in the range of 0 to 10 mm/s. Tests showed that the displacement measurement error is <0.17 mm in the nominal range (0.5% in the full scale) and the measurement error of force is <1.6 N in the nominal range (1.1% in the full scale). Experimental results indicate that the apparatus is reliable and flexible for measuring the mechanical properties of foot tissue in vivo in conjunction with pain and discomfort thresholds.

This paper investigates the information configuration for quick access of flight information. Seven potential grouping methods were tested. Search time depends on the layout of information (p < 0.001). Search was fastest when the information was arranged in the order of airline logo, airline name and arrival or departure time.

79955665164	Thermal characteristics of infrared radiation protective vests	Solar heat radiation can impose significant heat stress on employees performing outdoor tasks. A prototype infrared reflecting vest was developed to offer protection to agricultural workers and constructions workers who are exposed to high levels of outdoor solar radiation. The prototype vest was tested using a laboratory based thermal manikin exposed to controlled heat radiation intensity levels. The tests showed that a vest including 3.2 cm spacers was able to reduce heat gain by 30% without imposing a significant corresponding insulation heat gain. The thermal cross-over point for such a vest was lowest in comparison to others configurations tested. Commercial development of such a vest for use by agricultural workers and construction workers in desert environments is encouraged.

0035526314	Effects of training and representational characteristics in icon design	Icons are a very important component of graphical user interfaces. However, icon design is still predominantly artistic in nature and as a result icon selection is generally based on usability evaluations after a set of alternative icons are developed. This process tends to be time-consuming and costly. In this research, we address the issues of what should be depicted in an icon, given the function it should represent, and how training affects the performance of novice users when using an iconic interface. A set of 36 concrete icons (12 functions) were selected and tested with a total of 30 participants. The experimental results indicate that complete representations are generally superior for both untrained and trained participants. Results also show that trained participants had shorter response times when compared to untrained participants. Further analysis suggests that ambiguity, uniqueness and dominance are three important aspects to consider when designing and developing icons. Applications of this research include the design of appropriate icons for graphical user interfaces prior to usability testing and the importance of a short training period to illustrate the composition of an icon in an effort to improve the mental model associated with each design.

79960339667	Footbed influences on posture and perceived feel	Past studies have evaluated body postures when wearing high-heeled shoes. However, the effects of the various parameters that give the footbed its shape have not been investigated. This study determined the perceived feel and the associated postures with the different types of footbed shapes at two heel heights of 50 and 75 mm. Results show that a 10 degree wedge angle at 50 mm and an 18 degree wedge angle at 75 mm have the highest perceived feel during standing. The corresponding postures were significantly different from the others tested, suggesting that a well-designed footbed is a necessary condition to feel comfortable and to maintain good posture. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80455174491	A new region growing algorithm for triangular mesh recovery from scattered 3d points	A novel region growing algorithm is proposed for triangular mesh recovery from scattered 3D points. In our method, the new principle is used to determine the seed triangle considering both maximum angle and minimum length; the open influence region is defined for the active edge under processing; positional element is added into the criterion to choose the most suitable active point; geometric integrity is maintained by analyzing different situations of the selected active point and their corresponding treatments. Our approach has been tested with various unorganized point clouds, and the experimental results proved its efficiency in both accuracy and speed. Compared with the existing similar techniques, our algorithm has the ability to recover triangular meshes while preserving better topological coherence with the original 3D points. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

81855161292	Thermal properties of reflective helmet exposed to infrared radiation	The thermodynamic properties of a model infrared heat reflective helmet were evaluated using an advanced thermal manikin technology. The aluminized model helmet was tested for infrared (IR) radiation attenuation properties. Total manikin heat gain and changes in surface temperature were documented for controlled IR radiation exposure levels. The results illustrate the benefits offered by an aluminized reflective surface in attenuating IR radiation and the advantages of using a spacer harness system to minimize radiant heat transfer from the helmet to the head.

81855163381	Model based foot shape classification using 2D foot outlines	This study introduces a novel technique to identify foot outline characteristics and to classify feet into groups using turning functions and clustering techniques so that shape can complement anthropometry in producing good fitting shoes. The digital 3D foot scans, obtained from 50 Hong Kong Chinese subjects (25 males and 25 females) were processed to generate the foot outlines at heights of 2 mm and 40 mm. The outlines were represented as turning functions and the similarity among shapes was determined using average linkage clustering. The results show that there are two distinct shape groups for the 40 mm foot outlines on both medial and lateral sides of the foot. The presence (46%) or absence (54%) of a medial bulge characterizes the medial side, while the two shape groups on the lateral side are mainly due to the lateral concavity in the mid-foot region. The group with a lateral concavity consists of more females (68%) and thus lateral side of foot outline appears to be gender related. Furthermore, the medial and lateral side clusters are not related to each other. The medial side shape from the 2 mm foot outline is a good indicator of fallen arches. Based on the analyses, four types of feet were identified: feet with (1) lateral concavity and a medial bulge, (2) a medial bulge and no lateral concavity, (3) lateral concavity and no medial bulge and (4) lateral concavity and a medial bulge. These shape differences can be useful in the design of shoe lasts and in the manufacture of compatible footwear so that trial and error fitting can be minimized. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

81855185874	Center of pressure variations in high-heeled shoes	The way in which a person's foot contacts a shoe surface can have short-term and long-term effects on the whole body. Most previous research on footwear has been carried out using commercially available shoes, and as a result the surface of the shoe with which the foot interacts has not been systematically investigated. A recent invention has allowed the design parameters of a shoe to be investigated. The wedge angle and midfoot conditions were varied, and their effects were modeled with psychophysical relationships. The results show that perceived feelings are closely related to the location of the center of pressure. Copyright 2011 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc. All rights reserved.

84856440496	Constrained path tracking at varying angles in a mouse tracking task	Objective: This study was aimed to determine the effects of direction and path length on movement time when traversing a constrained path of width, W, in a mouse tracking task. Background: Tracking within constrained paths has been demonstrated to hold in many applications. Movement time and velocity of movement have shown very similar relationships, possibly because of the lack of extreme testing conditions. Most previous research evaluated conditions with only constant path length (A) of movement. Method: A total of 15 participants performed a mouse steering task within a constrained path at various angles. The independent variables were track width (W), path length, and path angle. Movement time was the dependent variable. Results: Analyses showed a significant effect of movement direction on movement time, and the relationship was approximately sinusoidal and symmetrical about the horizontal axis. Path length had a significant effect on speed of movement, which was not that apparent on movement time. At low A/W values, movements appeared to be ballistic. Conclusion: Tracking within constrained paths can be modeled to account for the effect of path angle. Application: Vertical hand movements, especially within constrained paths, may not be ideal from a performance and biomechanical standpoint. The performance curve gradients are a good way to evaluate and standardize the testing of input devices and to define acceptable speeds for various tolerances in computer and industrial tasks that involve angular motions. The results of this experiment will help designers to optimize products and training programs. © 2012 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

84856503173	Time use behavior in single and time-sharing tasks	Human errors in aviation, process plants and other critical industries can result in dire consequences and hence it is essential to understand the operator behavior and task characteristics in order to improve task performance and safety. The time available and how it is used by the operator are important factors in multi-task situations. Polychrons are people, who favor doing multiple tasks at the same time, while monochrons prefer doing tasks in series. In this study, the strategy, performance and workload of monochrons and polychrons were evaluated in a single and dual control tasks. The task difficulty and multiple task priority were independent variables. Results indicated that polychrons switched between two tasks more than monochrons and achieved better performance when the tasks were equally important and difficult. When the priority between the tasks was different, monochrons changed their emphasis to the more important task even though polychrons did not change their strategy as dramatically as the monochrons. In addition, monochrons indicated significantly higher workload and difficulty than polychrons. Results of this study can be important for the development of training programs of personnel involved in time-critical operations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84859203798	Open-loop and feedback-controlled mouse cursor movements in linear paths	Path length (A), path width (W) and movement direction (θ) are identified as the main factors affecting visually-controlled movement times in linear paths. Effects of A and W are well described by Drury's (1971. Movements with lateral constraint. Ergonomics, l4 (2), 293-305.) model in which movement time is linearly related to the ratio of A/W. At low A/W values, departure from linearity has been identified but not investigated in detail. Data are presented for both open-loop and feedback-controlled movements in linear paths at 0, 60 and 150° movement directions. Movement amplitude and path width were varied over a wide range to determine the effects of A and (A/W) on movement time. Movements were found to be made ballistically or in open-loop mode when the ratio (A/W) was less than about 8 to 10 and the movement times were linearly related to √A for all angles of movement. Feedback-controlled movements followed Drury's law; ballistic movements had movement speed linear with √A. Practitioner Summary: Many tasks require manoeuvring equipment or devices through a path of limited width. These movements can be made with or without feedback control, depending on the path constraints. The conditions for the two forms of movement are determined in this research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84860199242	Interactive deformation simulation of manual girth measurement for limbs	The existing methods for automatic girth measurement are primarily based on 3D point cloud or its generated surfaces, without considering limbs' elasticity and thus the interactive deformation during manual measurement. Taking human foot as example, we propose a new method to simulate manual girth measurement using 3D triangular mesh and mass-spring model. The deformation is limited in the local deformed region consisted of tape region, propagation region and compensation region, while the latter two regions are controlled with depth parameters representing the affected ranges of limb surface from external forces. We also present a novel algorithm to dynamically calculate volume change of the deforming limb, and then repair the lost volume with compensation function. Our approach has the advantages of low computational complexity and realistic volume preserved simulation for interactive deformation in manual measurement. The proposed method is tested with experimental results, which illustrate its efficiency in many applications such as custom products making. © 2012 International Information Institute.

0036902975	Visual search strategies and eye movements when searching Chinese character screens	Most visual search studies have been restricted to alphanumeric stimulus materials. Research related to scanning patterns of Chinese characters is sparse. This study is an attempt to understand the differences and similarities in visual search of Chinese characters having a varying degree of complexity among Hong Kong Chinese, Mainland Chinese and Chinese reading non-Chinese people. Eighteen participants were tested on Chinese character screens with three layouts (row, column, and uniform separation) and two word complexities (high and low). The 18 participants comprised six Hong Kong Chinese, six Mainland Chinese and six non-native Chinese readers. Performance data and eye movement data were recorded. The percent correct and search time were the two performance measures. A new measure, called HV-ratio was developed to characterize eye movements. The results show that Hong Kong Chinese use predominantly horizontal search patterns while the Mainland Chinese change their search pattern depending on the layout presented. Non-native Chinese readers, on the other hand, do not seem to show any preference on scanning strategy for a given layout. Word complexity did not show any significant effect on search time. Potential reasons for these differences and design implications are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0038368920	Foot landmarking for footwear customization	As consumers are becoming increasingly selective of what they wear on their feet, manufacturers are experiencing problems developing and fitting the right footwear. Literature suggests that shoes with a shape similar to feet may be comfortable because they attempt to maintain the feet in a neutral posture. The objective of this paper is to develop a metric to quantify mismatches between feet and lasts and also to be able to generate the two-dimensional outline of the foot using the minimum number of landmarks. Fifty Hong Kong Chinese were participants in the experiment. In addition to subject weight, height, foot length and foot width, the left foot outlines were drawn and 18 landmarks were marked on each of the two-dimensional foot outlines. A step-wise procedure was used to reduce the chosen 18 landmarks to eight, such that the mean absolute negative error (an indicator of 'tightness') between the foot outline and the modelled curve was 1.3 mm. These eight landmarks seem to show an improvement over those proposed by other researchers, thus showing the importance of choosing the right landmarks for modelling the foot. The positive and negative absolute errors were on average 1.8 mm and 1.3 mm respectively. Moreover, the mean errors for the toe region and for the rest of the foot were 1.7 mm and 1.6 mm respectively. The results indicate that the foot outline, an important component for footwear functionality and fitting, may be modelled using eight critical landmarks.

84867244822	Eye scan patterns of the time use trait and its use in management	The time use trait of monchronicity and polychronicity, which relates to one's ability to do one thing and many things at a time respectively, has been known for a long time. However, its implications on how people scan and attend to information are not so clear. This study is an attempt to investigate the attentional strategy differences between monochrons (M) and polychrons (P) under different task conditions using eye scan equipment. Two groups of participants (monochrons and polychrons) performed a dual control task having 3 task priorities and 4 task difficulty levels. The results showed significant differences in scanning patterns between monochrons and polychrons, among task priorities and/or task difficulty levels. Results of this study may be useful in semi-automated systems in order to achieve optimal performance.

84879946566	Setting that mouse for tracking tasks	A pointing device plays an important role in human-computer interaction. The computer mouse is a convenient device for both pointing and steering. The literature related to the effect of mouse gain on steering tasks is scarce. An experiment was conducted with 10 participants and each participant was asked to traverse a constrained path using a computer mouse. There were three levels of gain approximately equal to 2.3, 10, and 15. The experiment had 11 levels of difficulty (D/P) based on path width (P) and path length (D) and three trials for each combination of D and P. Performance was evaluated using movement time taken to traverse the path. The results showed that movement time is minimized, in feedback-controlled steering tasks, at a gain of around nine. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

0345294405	Forward sloping chair effects on spinal shape in the Hong Kong Chinese and Indian populations	Forward sloping seats are universally accepted based on their increased trunk-thigh angle during sitting. However, these seats are not preferred by some individuals due to reasons such as excessive pressure on knees, difficulties during ingress and egress, and postural fixity during sitting. Some researchers have claimed that forward sloped sitting preserves the lumbar lordosis, thereby making it more comfortable for the sitter. This claim has not been validated across all populations and, therefore, appears to have some disagreement among researchers. In this study, spinal shape during standing and sitting in forward sloping chairs is measured and quantified using a three-dimensional sonic digitizer. Twenty subjects (ten Hong Kong Chinese and ten Indian) have participated in the experiment. Fifteen points on the spine are digitized during standing and sitting in a forward-sloping seat with trunk-thigh angles of 70°, 80°, 90°, 100°, 110°, and 120°. Different measures are used to analyze and differentiate the spinal shape. The correlation between the length of spine during standing and a subject's height is low, but significant. The behavior of the spinal shape change during sitting differs between the populations as shown by the maximum lumbar and maximum thoracic deviations. The Indian subjects seem to approach the standing curvatures in the thoracic region during 30° forward sloping sitting. The Hong Kong Chinese subjects, on the other hand, do not show any resemblance to the standing curvatures during forward sloping sitting. One possible reason could be the differences in arch angle between the two populations. The variations in spinal shape among subjects appear to be similar within a population.

84888084498	A model for combined targeting and tracking tasks in computer applications	Current models for targeted-tracking are discussed and shown to be inadequate as a means of understanding the combined task of tracking, as in the Drury's paradigm, and having a final target to be aimed at, as in the Fitts' paradigm. It is shown that the task has to be split into components that are, in general, performed sequentially and have a movement time component dependent on the difficulty of the individual component of the task. In some cases, the task time may be controlled by the Fitts' task difficulty, and in others, it may be dominated by the Drury's task difficulty. Based on an experiment carried out that captured movement time in combinations of visually controlled and ballistic movements, a model for movement time in targeted-tracking was developed. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84889795853	Superiority of freehand pointing	There is a possibility that computer mice may be replaced with eye-gaze or touchscreen technologies. Hence, it is imperative that we investigate the effect of the type of input device in conditions having lateral constraints. A set of tracks with different levels of difficulty were tested. The type of device had little influence on movement time for ballistic steering tasks, while movement time was affected by the type of device used in visually controlled steering tasks. It was also found that resting the forearm increased movement time. Subjective evaluations indicated that control is easier with freehand pointing. Considering both comfort and performance it appears that freehand pointing, when resting the forearm, is optimal for a touchscreen. Copyright 2013 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc.
