14344259141	Numerical simulations of pre-detonation ignition of pulse detonation engines	Two-dimensional numerical simulations are performed to study pre-detonation ignition of pulse detonation engines. The effects of the way of installment and the geometry of the pre-detonators on detonation transmission are studied and discussed. The pre-detonators are installed at the close end of the main detonation tube in two basic ways: either in parallel with or perpendicular to the main detonation tube. The results indicate that the perpendicular arrangement is better than the parallel one because the reflected shock waves play an important role in detonation transmission. The results also demonstrate that the diameter ratio of the pre-detonator to the main detonation tube is a very important parameter. The length of the pre-detonator is much less important than its diameter. For the case of the same mixtures, if the diameter is smaller than the critical diameter, detonation transmission cannot be assured by increasing the length of the pre-detonation tube alone.

19044368170	Closed-loop system bias in a capacitive micro-accelerometer	The nonexclusive bias in the closed-loop measurement system of a capacitive micro-accelerometer was analyzed with a theoretical model of the mechanical and electrical characteristics. The static equilibrium model of the micro-accelerometer included the close-loop output, the bias, and the bias repeatability. Experimental measurements related the bias and the preload to the bias repeatability, the width of the blind area, etc. The principle of movable fingers is clarified to prove that the bias repeatability is directly proportional to the width of the blind area. The model, which successfully explains the phenomena, can be used to improve bias repeatability and is for the design of micro-mechanical structures and the selection of preloads.

21244466410	XPath evaluation oriented XML data stream compression	Because XML (extensible markup language) is self-described, there is much redundant structural information in XML data stream. How to compress XML data so as to reduce the network transfer cost and support XPath evaluation on the compressed data is a new area of research. The existing methods on XML compression require the multi-pass scan on data or can not support real time query processing on compressed data. In this paper, a novel compression method XSC (XML stream compression) is proposed to compress and decompress XML stream in real time. XSC constructs XML element event sequence dictionary and outputs the related index dynamically. When DTD is available, XSC can generate the XML element event sequence graph for producing more reasonable encoding before XML data stream is processed. The compressed XML data stream can be decomposed directly for XPath evaluation. Experimental results show that XSC outperforms other methods in compression ratio and compression efficiency, and the cost of XPath evaluation on compressed data stream is acceptable.

33746268426	Pull-in failures of electrostatic force feedback micro accelerometers	Pull-in failures of electrostatic force feedback micro accelerometers occur when the electrostatic force can not overcome the adhesion of the moveable sensing mass to the wall. Pull-in failures are the main cause of failures in micro accelerometers. Remedies for such failures were developed by analyzing the pull-in failure mechanisms for open-loop and closed-loop active controls. Three stability conditions were found to be functions of the electrostatic force, the mechanical stiffness, the stopper gap, and other parameters. These conditions can be used to judge whether pull-in failure will occur. Experiments show that the stability conditions are accurate so they can be used to design reliable micro accelerometers. Proper choices of the structural and electrical parameters can entirely eliminate pull-in failures.

33748942443	A novel algorithm for Doppler frequency rate estimation of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar	Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can obtain high-resolution radar images under all weather, day and night and long distance conditions, and has been applied widely in military and civil fields. Range-Doppler (RD) algorithm is a simple and typical imaging algorithm. The key of it is Doppler parameters estimations, including Doppler centroid frequency and Doppler frequency rate. Doppler frequency rate is variational with range. If the estimation of it is inaccurate, it will bring severe defocusing effect and blurring in azimuth direction. The previous estimations of Doppler frequency rate usually use image field instead of data field, the calculated amount is very large and the imaging speed is slow. In order to improve them, this paper proposes a novel Doppler frequency rate estimation algorithm for spaceborne SAR imaging.

34547930487	Modeling of an electrostatic micromotor based on a levitated rotor	This paper presents a mathematical model developed for an electrostatically levitated micromotor in which the ring-shaped rotor is levitated by electrostatic force in five degrees of freedom (DOFs). A glass/silicon/glass sandwich structure is utilized in this electrostatic micromotor, which is based on the technology of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). In the center of ring-shaped cavity formed by ICP between the top and bottom glass plates, the rotor is levitated by the five DOFs position servo system and driven by speed control system. In this paper, the mathematical model for the motion control of the rotor in five DOFs is developed. This model describes the capacitances and electrostatic forces between the rotor and associated electrodes, and moments of two rotations about the x, y-axis. The rotational torque model governing the rotor's rotational speed is also described. In order to obtain the analytical nonlinear models for error analysis, these integral equations are expanded using the Taylor's series. Moreover the finite element model and its simulation results are obtained by using ANSYS. In terms of comparison between the simulated results and the nonlinear models, the modeling accuracy of the micromotor can be evaluated. Furthermore, the error characteristics of the linearized models via rotor displacement are analyzed. Thus, position sensing and control of both the rotor's motion, and the rotational speed, can be achieved based on these linearized models of electrostatically levitated micromotors.

35048868489	X2S: Translating XPath into Efficient SQL Queries	Translating XPath into SQL queries is necessary if XML documents are stored in relational databases. Although most of the current methods can translate XPath into equivalent SQL queries, they seldom focus on the efficiency of the translated SQL queries. This paper proposes a method called X2S to handle the problem. X2S is based on the extended relational encoding, which can deal with the operators in XPath efficiently. X2S also exploits DTD to rewrite the XPath logically before the SQL translation. The goal of the rewriting is to eliminate the wildcards of the XPath, to remove the ancestor/descendant relationship and to shorten the length of the XPath. An estimation cost model is used to choose one with the lowest cost from the candidate SQL statements. The experimental results demonstrate that the SQL queries generated by X2S outperform those from other methods significantly. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

A linearized Reynolds equation was used to describe the squeeze film damping with a Couette model to describe the slide film damping with the gas flow, temperature variations and compressibility. The interior chamber gas film was subdivided into eight ring-shaped zones with translational damping coefficients at large magnitudes, radial vibration damping coefficients at small angles, and axial rotation damping coefficients for the rotator. Simulations show that the z-axis squeeze film damping has a dominant effect on the gyroscope levitation, with gas damping coefficients proportional to the second power of the gas film thickness and linearly related to the gas temperatures.

38049139142	CLAIM: An efficient method for relaxed frequent closed itemsets mining over stream data	Recently, frequent itemsets mining over data streams attracted much attention. However, mining closed itemsets from data stream has not been well addressed. The main difficulty lies in its high complexity of maintenance aroused by the exact model definition of closed itemsets and the dynamic changing of data streams. In data stream scenario, it is sufficient to mining only approximated frequent closed itemsets instead of in full precision. Such a compact but close-enough frequent itemset is called a relaxed frequent closed itemsets. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of RC (Relaxed frequent Closed Itemsets), which is the generalized form of approximation. We also propose a novel mechanism CLAIM, which stands for C Losed approximated Itemset Mining, to support efficiently mining of RC. The CLAIM adopts bipartite graph model to store frequent closed itemsets, use Bloom filter based hash function to speed up the update of drifted itemsets, and build a compact HR-tree structure to efficiently maintain the RCs and support mining process. An experimental study is conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach at handling frequent closed itemsets mining for data stream. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Experiments are conducted in a hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal Mach number of 6. It is demonstrated that the shock/shock interaction on the blunt body is avoided due to injection and the peak pressure at the reattachment point is reduced by 70% under a 4° attack angle. © 2009 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

67651171524	Neurodevelopment in newborns: A sample entropy analysis of electroencephalogram	The present paper investigates the neural ontogeny of newborns in view of electroencephalogram (EEG) complexity during active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Sample entropy (SampEn) is applied to EEG recordings from 168 newborns with postmenstrual age (PMA) ranging from 25 to 60 weeks. The relationship between neurodevelopment and PMA is then explored according to the statistical analysis of the median and interquartile range of SampEn curves. It is found that SampEn of EEG during AS is higher than that during QS. SampEn increases during both AS and QS before about 42 weeks in PMA while it ceases its increase in QS and even decreases in AS after newborns reaching term age. A distinct decrease in the interquartile range of SampEn is found with increasing PMA (from 25 to about 50 weeks), followed by maintenance of low fluctuation in SampEn curves. The study in this paper sets the stage for exhaustive investigation of the SampEn of EEG during brain maturation in newborns. And it could be hoped that SampEn in sleep EEG might be a useful parameter against which delays and aberrations in brain maturation might be tested. The SampEn changes during brain maturation also offer functional clues about neurodevelopment, based on which further explorations could be done. The significance of this paper is the discovery of the decrease in EEG complexity after newborns reaching term. Although some potential neurophysiologic reasons are given, this new discovery might require more study to investigate. In addition, the fluctuation of EEG complexity is analyzed for the first time, which helps to understand the EEG maturation in neurodevelopment. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

71049180265	Optimized controller for electrostatic force feedback micro accelerometers	Oscillation failures of electrostatic force feedback micro accelerometers, which seriously limits their reliability, occur when the accelerometer suddenly suffers an external acceleration impact. The variation of the system dynamic characteristics with large external accelerations was studied to determine the cause of such failures. The electrostatic stiffness was included in during the analysis to optimize the analog controller design. SIMULINK simulations verify that the failures are due to the electrostatic stiffness that the solution is effective. The analysis and optimized solution give a reliable design that eliminates oscillation failures after impacts by properly choosing the controller structure and parameters.

The volume of frontal lobe of neonate increased with gestational age within 7 days after birth (r=0.676, P<0.05). The volume of frontal lobe in the 33 children with serious brain injury was lower than that in the control group at 1 month and the difference was significant at 3 and 6 months (P<0.01). There was a correlation between the long-term nervous system dysplasia and the slow increase of frontal lobe volume. The volume of frontal lobe increases with gestational age. The brain injury during the perinatal period affects the development of frontal lobe and is related with neural dysplasia. 3D ultrasound is useful for evaluating the normal and abnormal brain development. ©2009 IEEE.

77953316921	Burst suppression EEG in neonatal convulsions	Convulsions represent a characteristic signal of neurological disease in the newborn period. Single-channel EEG is a convenient tool for continuous evaluation of neonatal convulsions and gives valuable prognostic information on neurological recovery. Among various abnormal EEG waveforms during convulsions, burst suppression (BS) pattern is distinctive and usually indicates an urgent state that therapeutic interventions should be performed appropriately and instantly. Four temporal variables (i.e. burst suppression ratio, burst frequency, burst amplitude, and suppression amplitude) were selected as BS features in this paper to describe the convulsive EEG signals from 47 full term neonates. Subjects were divided into mild convulsive group (22 neonates) and serious convulsive group (25 neonates) according to their standard clinical diagnoses. Wilcoxon rank sum test shows that both the burst suppression ratio and burst amplitude are significantly different between mild and serious groups (p ≪ 0.01) while burst frequency and suppression amplitude exhibit similar values in two groups (p = 0.76 and p = 0.46). According to linear discriminant analysis, nearest neighbor rule (NNR) is used to perform pattern classification in the plane supported by the first two discriminant BS features (i.e. burst suppression ratio and burst amplitude). The leave-one-out recognition rate of NNR is 0.96. Results in the present paper indicate that burst suppression ratio and burst amplitude are effective discriminant BS features which help to guarantee a rigorous evaluation of neonatal convulsions. ©2010 IEEE.

This study firstly demonstrates that the quasi-detonation is of thermal choking. If the conditions of thermal choking are created by some disturbances, the supersonic flow is then unable to accept additional thermal energy, and the CJ detonation becomes the unstable quasi-detonation precipitately. The kinetic energy loss caused by this transition process is firstly considered in this new physical model. The numerical results are in good agreement with previous experimental observations qualitatively, which demonstrates that the quasi-detonation model is physically correct and the study are fundamentally important for detonation and supersonic combustion research. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

78650410972	Adapting adjustment of stiffness for force feedback micro accelerometer	To improve the roborant capacity and the resolution of a micromechanical accelerometer, the nonlinearity of the system was studied. The mathematic model of the system was discussed and the variable electrostatic stiffness brought by the nonlinearity of a electrostatic torque was analyzed. Analytical results show that the preload voltage is used to be less than 0.707 time of crippling load voltage so as to make total stiffness greater than zero, which will cause a poor resolution when the input is near 0g. In view of the nonlinear effect, an adaptive adjustment method in which the total stiffness was kept a constant and the preload voltage and the feedback voltage were renewed every sampling cycle was proposed to improve the stability and resolution of the system. Finally, a digital micro accelerometer based on DSP was developed, then it was tested by using the adaptive adjustment method. Experimental results indicate that the resolution of the accelerometer is improved from 43.2 μg to 11.3 μg near 0g and from 36.4 μg to 12.1 μg near 1g. These data prove the system performance has been improved greatly.

79955096124	Calculation and improvement on amplification effect of MEMS leverage mechanism	Resonant MEMS accelerometer has high stability and strong anti-interference ability, and the change of resonant beam stiffness with axial inertial force can be used to detect the acceleration magnitude. In order to get a high scale factor, MEMS leverage mechanism is usually used to amplify the inertial force. But the amplification effect can't meet the theoretical value in the experiments, especially for multi-leverage mechanism. To solve this problem, the leverage mechanism model is reasonably simplified, and finite element analysis method is used to calculate the amplification effect. The stiffness of mechanical levers, support beams of proof mass and resonant beams are obtained separately. The theoretical analysis and simulation ANSYS are made, and the results demonstrate the validity of this method. At last, the method to obtain high amplification by increasing the output stiffness is given based on the proposed method, and the amplification of a MEMS leverage mechanism can be improved from 3.9 to 7.0.

79955499376	Reference values for amplitude-integrated EEGs in infants from preterm to 3.5 months of age	OBJECTIVES: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) is a valuable tool for the continuous evaluation of functional brain maturation in infants. The amplitudes of the upper and lower margins of aEEGs are postulated to change with maturation and correlate with postmenstrual age (PMA). In this study we aimed to establish reliable reference values of aEEG amplitudes, which provide quantitative guidelines for assessing brain maturation as indicated by aEEG results in neonates and young infants. METHODS: aEEGs from healthy infants (n = 274) with PMAs that ranged from 30 to 55 weeks were divided into 10 groups according to their PMAs. Two 5-minute segments were selected from each aEEG and were used to automatically calculate the upper and lower margins and bandwidths of the aEEG tracings. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was achieved with an overall correlation of 0.99. The upper and lower margins of the aEEGs in both active and quiet sleep clearly rose in infants after the neonatal period. The bandwidth defined as the graphic distance decreased almost monotonically throughout the PMA range from 30 to 55 weeks. The lower margin of the aEEG was positively correlated with PMA, with a larger rank correlation coefficient during quiet sleep (r = 0.89) than during active sleep (r = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Reference values of aEEG amplitudes were obtained for infants with a wide range of PMAs and constituted the basis for the quantitative assessment of aEEG changes with maturation in neonates and young infants. The normative amplitudes of aEEG margins, especially of the lower margin in quiet sleep, are recommended as a source of reference data for the identification of potentially abnormal aEEG results.

0035506929	Extracting local schema form semistructured data based on graph-oriented semantic model	Many modern applications (e-commerce, digital library, etc.) require integrated access to various information sources (from traditional RDBMS to semistructured Web repositories). Extracting schema from semistructured data is a prerequisite to integrate heterogeneous information sources. The traditional method that extracts global schema may require time (and space) to increase exponentially with the number of objects and edges in the source. A new method is presented in this paper, which is about extracting local schema. In this method, the algorithm controls the scale of extracting schema within the "schema diameter" by examining the semantic distance of the target set and using the Hash class and its path distance operation. This method is very efficient for restraining schema from expanding. The prototype validates the new approach.

81555219703	Method for reducing vibration deflection on micromechanical accelerometer	In order to reduce the deflection of the accelerometers with asymmetric sensors, the reasons and the suppression methods for vibration deflection are studied. Firstly, the mathematical model of the system is analyzed. For the asymmetric sensor when symmetric capacitors detection circuit is used, even parameters will be existed in the relation equation between the circuit output and the displacement of the mobile plate inside the sensor, so the vibration deflection comes about. And then, the nonlinearity of the torquer is analyzed. The equivalent symmetric method through electrostatic force bias is discussed. It is obtained that the method cannot restrain the vibration deflection. Additionally, an equivalent symmetry compensating method for asymmetric sensor and an equivalent symmetry method for electrostatic torque are proposed. It is found that the method can improve the vibration deflection through theoretical analysis. Finally, contrast experiments are made. Results show that as equivalent symmetry method is used, the deflection of the accelerometer with poor symmetry sensor under the vibration is reduced, and the linearity is well kept.

The modeling and compensation of thermal drift are necessary for improving the precision and expanding the use scope.

Thermal drift prognosis and compensation models were built by surface fitting, support vector machine and relevance vector machine, respectively.

In this nonablative thermal protection system a spike-blunt body structure and lateral jets are combined together to realize the flowfield modification. The spike transforms the bow shock into a conical shock, and the lateral jets increase the angle of conical shock wave and keep it away from the blunt body to avoid severe shock/shock interactions. Flow visualizations and pressure measurements were conducted in a hypersonic wind tunnel at Mach number 6 to demonstrate this concept. Numerical simulations were also carried out. Both experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the non-ablative thermal protection system works well for shock-wave drag reduction and thermal protection. The peak pressure at the reattachment region is reduced by 65% even under 4 deg attack angle by the lateral jet. Experimental data also show that the working pressure of lateral jets is much lower than that of forwardfacing jets at the stagnation point. All the results show that the engineering application of non-ablative thermal protection system appears to be quite promising.

Methods: Thirty-eight premature infants of less than 32 weeks' gestational age and with white matter damage, including 20 cases of mild white matter damage and 18 cases of severe white matter damage, were included in the study. Forty-two premature infants without white matter damage were selected as a control group. After birth, they were examined using aEEG and brain ultrasound once a week until four weeks after birth or a corrected gestational age of 32 weeks. The white matter damage and control groups were compared in terms of aEEG patterns and amplitudes and burst suppression ratio (BSR) on EEG. Results: The white matter damage and control groups had highly discontinuous patterns and had no complete sleep cycles. The lower amplitude was significantly smaller in the severe white matter damage subgroup than in the mild white matter damage subgroup and control group. There was alternating burst-suppression activity on the raw EEG in the white matter damage and control groups; and the severe white matter damage subgroup had a significantly longer suppression time and a significantly higher BSR on EEG compared with the mild white matter damage subgroup and control group. Conclusions: Brain function monitoring should be performed in premature infants with white matter damage early after birth so as to detect cases of severe white matter damage in time.

84881294598	Conceptual Study on Non-ablative TPS for Hypersonic Vehicles	In order to achieve efficient wave drag reduction under non-zero attack angles and avoid the severe aerodynamic heating, a new concept of the Non-ablative Thermal Protection System (NaTPS) for hypersonic vehicles was proposed based on the idea that the conical shock wave angle can be enlarged by lateral jets to push the conical shock away from the blunt body surface. In the NaTPS, a spike-blunt body structure and lateral jets are combined together to develop a new shock-reconstructing system in front of hypersonic vehicles. When the spike acts to recast the bow shock in front of a blunt body into a conical shock, the lateral jet works to protect the spike tip from overheating and push the conical shock away from the blunt body when a pitching angle exists during flight. The experimental flow visualization and the pressure measurements were conducted in a hypersonic wind tunnel for both the conceptual demonstration and CFD validation. Numerical simulations were also carried out to examine the complex flow around the NaTPS. Both experimental and numerical results show that the NaTPS works well for shock drag reduction and thermal protection. The shock/shock interaction on shoulders of the blunt body is avoided due to lateral jet injection and the peak pressure at the reattachment region is reduced by 65% under a 4° attack angle. The lateral jet could be powered either by high pressure gas stored in the tank or by the water evaporation process in which water absorbs the heat from the hot walls of the blunt noses. The jet pressure needed for producing lateral jet is much smaller than for the forward-facing jet from the stagnation point. The advantages of this concept are well demonstrated and its practical application appears promising. ©2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.
