17844377097	Star-shaped and linear nanosised molecules functionalized with hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene: Synthesis and optical properties	(Chemical Equation Presented) A synthetic strategy promising the establishment of a new star-shaped and linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) family with distinct molecular topologies has been developed. The Sonogashira reaction between the iodide derivatives 2a-e and phenylacetylene catalyzed with Pd(0) affords 3a-e in high yields. The Diels-Alder and decarbonylation reactions between 3a-e and tetraphenylcyclophentadiene following the oxidation by FeCl3 produce the star-shaped and linear PAHs 5a-e containing a five-membered ring. The structural analysis and the optical properties of all new compounds are performed by a combination of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectrometry. The electronic and photophysical properties are studied by orthogonal comparisons of the absorption and fluorescence spectra in THF solutions, which not only give insight into the interactions among aromatic submoieties in each molecule and the effects of meta-conjugation and para-conjugation on electronic delocalization, but also indicate effective conjugation length variations from oligophenylacetylenes 3a-e to oligophenylene dendrimers 4a-e and PAHs 5a-e. The star-shaped 5c exhibits the highest aggregation in excited states compared with the other four hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) derivatives. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

18744373924	Oligothiophene-functionalized truxene: Star-shaped compounds for organic field-effect transistors	Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on oligothiophene- functionalized truxene derivatives have been fabricated for use as novel star-shaped organic semiconductors in solution-processible organic electronics. The electronic and optical properties of compounds 1-3, with increasing numbers of thiophene rings at each of the three branches, have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction measurements, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The results show that with a stepwise increase of the thiophene rings at every branch, a transition from a polycrystalline to an amorphous state is observed. The characteristics of compounds 1, 2, and 3 used for OFETs exhibit a significant difference. The mobility depends greatly on the morphology in the solid state, and decreases in going from 1 to 3.

39749084475	Acetylene-grafted resins derived from phenolics via azo coupling reaction	Novel phenolic resins with high ethynyl contents were realized via azo coupling reaction between phenol units and diazonium of 3-ethynylaniline. If Novolac and high-ortho Novolac resins were used as the starting materials directly, the ratio of ethynyl groups to phenolic rings was ca 70%; while the ratio was 100% for the resin from Friedel-Craft polycondensation of 4-(3-ethynylphenyl)salicyl alcohol. All the resins were readily soluble in acetone and ethanol, and meltable at temperatures below 100 °C. The resins underwent thermal addition-type cure with a broad exotherm of around 140-280 °C, and the starting curing temperature showed a downward drift with increase in the ethynyl content. The thermal properties of the cured resins, determined from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), were considerably superior to those of Novolac- and Resole-type phenolic resins. The initial decomposition temperatures were at ca 400 °C, and the anaerobic carbon yields were ca 80% for all the resins. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The enhanced red-shift was observed from the absorption and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these derivatives in dilute THF solution with the increase of thiophene unit at one branch of 9,9′-spirobifluorene identical with the increased p-electron delocalization and the more effective conjugation length of the whole molecular system.

Single crystal analysis indicated that the structure of indeno[2,1-c]fluorene was twisted due to close H - -H contacts in the crowded region of molecules. P1-P3 showed good solubility in common organic solvents as well as facile film forming properties. In comparison with linear n-alkyl-substituted oligo(indeno[1,2-b]fluorene)s and poly(indeno[1,2-b]fluorene)s (2,8-PIFs), the absorption and emission features of twisted n-alkyl-substituted oligo(indeno[2,1-c]fluorene)s and poly(indeno[2,1-c]fluorene) (P1) in dilute solution exhibited a correlation to the conjugation length and obviously blue-shifted due to the distorted backbones. All polymers emitted strong blue fluorescence with very narrow full widths at half-maximum (fwhm) (about 50 nm) in dilute solution and in thin film.

53849149012	Isomeric effect on microscale self-assembly: Interplay between molecular property and solvent polarity in the formation of 1D n-type microbelts	A study was conducted to demonstrate the development of a family of n-type semiconductors under mild conditions. The study observed n-type organic semiconductors are indispensable for diodes and complementary circuits with high operation speed and low power consumption. The study also observed the three carbonyl groups of truxenone can reduce the electron density of the aromatic force. An isomeric effect was observed at microscale, which helped to develop general rules related the one-dimensional self-assembly process of planar π-conjugated molecules. The electron-deficient aromatic core of truxenone and its symmetry can be used to determine interplay between molecular properties and solvent polarities in the self-assembly of 1D microstructures.

Explosive chemosensors based on these self-assembled organic crystalline nanostructures were successfully fabricated. The differences in the structures on the microscopic level and in the film morphologies led to dramatic enhancements of the explosive detection speed. With the evolution of structures from the netted 1D microbelts to the flowerlike supernanostructures, the detection speed of the chemosensors for DNT and TNT was improved by more than 700 times.

The experimental results showed that variation of the attached alkoxy chain number caused drastic structural changes of the corresponding assemblies. The competitions between the π-conjugated cores and the alkoxy chains led to the structural transformations from relatively compact core-induced line patterns to more open chain-induced networks. Furthermore, the substitution location of the attached alkoxy chain in the PBD molecules also played an important role in tuning the molecular conformations in the two-dimensional self-assembled monolayers. Thermally induced transformation from energetically unfavorable structures to thermodynamically favorable ones was also observed. The changes of the self-assembling structures of the PBDs due to the variation of the attached alkoxy chain number may help in understanding the optoelectronic properties of the organic field-effect transistors made of the alkoxylated PBD molecules. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

The investigation of their photophysical properties indicates that G0 and G1 exhibit almost the same absorption and PL spectra in dilute solutions and in thin films. The steric hindrance of the bulky dendrimers effectively prevents strong intermolecular interaction in the solid state, which effectively improves the emission spectral stability. Preliminary OLEDs fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/dendri- mer/TPBI/Ba/Al achieve a pure-blue emission with stable CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.16, 0.08) for both G0 and G1.

Polymer P obtained through a Sonogashira cross-coupling polymerization showed high affinity and excellent fluorescence quenching property toward electro-deficient compound DNT in solution. A versatile and effective electrospinning technique, which effectively reduced aggregation and fluorescence self-quenching of the conjugated polymers in thin film by the traditional spin-casting, was successfully employed to develop explosive-sensing nanofibrous devices. By doping with polystyrene as supporting matrix and subsequent electrospinning, the obtained fluorescent nanofibrous film exhibited remarkable sensitivity to trace DNT vapor due to a large surface area-to-volume ratio and unique porous structure. The sensitivity of the device was further improved by introducing secondary pores into the nanofibers through addition of a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate, as a porogen agent. This strategy can provide a platform for other conjugated polymers using electrospinning technology to construct new optical chemo- and biosensors. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

77950361363	Highly stable blue light-emitting materials with a three-dimensional architecture: Improvement of charge injection and electroluminescence performance	Two classes of blue emitters bearing electron-rich or electron-deficient units were developed for organic light-emitting diodes. Such shape persistent three-dimensional (3D) structures provided six molecules emitting pure and stable blue light. The photophysical, electrochemical, and thermal properties as well as the thin film morphologies of these blue emitters were investigated in detail. These results indicated that the side groups did not change the photophysical properties, but significantly affected the electrochemical properties to improve the charge injection and the aggregation behaviours of the molecules. The electroluminescence performance was greatly improved without using 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBI) as an electron injection layer after the introduction of Taz and Oxd as the side groups. In comparison with sFOMe, 9,9′-spirobifluorene-containing compounds (sFTaz, and sFOxd) exhibited better electroluminescence due to the improvement of the electron injection ability after the introduction of electron-deficient groups.

The host-guest structures are revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at liquid/solid interfaces. The effect of solvents on the host-guest structures is intensively investigated in different solvents such as 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), 1-phenyloctane, 1-octanol, and tetradecane. In contrast to the similar 2D hexagonal self-assembly of Tr host template on HOPG in different solvents, the formation of host-guest nanostructures of coronene in Tr 2D network strongly depend on the polarity of the solvents. The thermodynamic equilibrium during the host-guest assembly process is discussed, and the solvent-guest interaction is proposed as a main contributor for the observed solvent effect in the 2D host-guest self-assembly process.

77953648739	Structural-property relationship in pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline derivatives: Morphology, photophysical, and waveguide properties	The objective of this contribution is to achieve crystalline one-dimensional organic micro/nanostructures by self-assembling for active waveguides and other optoelectronic nanodevices. To improve solid emitting performance for highly efficient waveguide fibers, our strategy here is to adopt nonplanar conjugated segments to minimize unfavorably intermolecular fluorescent quenching in solid state; meanwhile, long alkyl chains are added as structural group that controls molecular packing. With this intention, a series of molecules based on pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline (PyQ) units were developed. The effects of the molecular geometry and symmetry on their optical properties, crystal dimensions, liquid crystals, and active waveguide properties were studied in detail to understand the structure-property relationship of organic conjugated molecules, which is of vital importance to rational design for organic self-assemblies toward optoelectronic applications. On a single molecular level, the molecular structures and their optical properties were correlated by computational methods. The combined results of morphology study, single crystal structure and two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction (2D-WAXD) indicated that the loss of the different molecular symmetry element affected the crystal dimensions. The microfibers of molecules 1 and 2 with their desirable crystal dimensions and surfaces were proved to be low-loss waveguide materials (0.02-0.05 dB/μm). Hence, we suggest that nonplanar aromatic core modified with proper side group may represent a promising approach to achieve crystalline optical waveguides.

Their photophysical and electrochemical properties are investigated in detail by UV/Vis absorption and photolumines- cent spectroscopy, and cyclic voltam- metry.

All D-p-A conjugated oligomers show a broad and strong absorption band from 250 to 700 nm in thin films. Solution- processed bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices using our oligomer as donor and PCBM as acceptor are fabricated and measured. The power conversion efficiency of the devices based on our oligomers continuously increases from DBTTr to TrTD2A as a result of an increasing relative absorption intensity in longer wavelength region by changing the donor-acceptor ratio and conjugated spacers between the donor and acceptor.

For instance, the absorption onset of D1A2T2 was located at about 780 nm and peaked at 606 nm in thin film. The steady and transient emission spectra showed that these compounds possess an intramolecular energy transfer in such a meta-conjugation system, which was further supported by our computational investigation.

In this contribution, two kinds of microscale flower-shaped morphologies with nanometer petals formed from the hierarchical self-assembly of benzothiophene derivatives bearing long alkyl chains have been developed as superhydrophobic surfaces. The intermediate stages of the assemblies demonstrated a new formation mechanism for such flower-shaped morphologies. The hierarchical morphologies of the film exhibited excellent water-repelling characteristics as superhydrophobic surfaces, which were prepared by means of a simple solution process. The transition process from the Cassie state to Wenzel state was easily realized owing to the slight microstructural differences in the two kinds of flowers caused by their different chemical structures.

These flexible macrocycles exhibited excellent "self-sorting" abilities with diamine compounds, which depended on the "induced-fit" rule. For instance, the host macrocycles underwent conformational modulation to accommodate the diamine guests, affording [1+1] intramolecular addition compounds regardless of the flexibility of the diamine. These macrocycles folded themselves to fit various diamines with different chain length through modulation of the flexible polyether chain, and afforded intramolecular condensation products. However, if the chain of the diamine was too long and rigid, oligomers or polymers were obtained from the mixture of the macromolecule and the diamine. All results demonstrated that inclusion compounds involving conformationally suitable aromatic diamines were thermodynamically favorable candidates in the mixture due to the restriction of the macrocycle size. Furthermore, kinetic and thermodynamic studies of self-sorting behaviors of both mixed 4O-5O and 4O-6O systems were investigated in detail. Finally, theoretical calculations were also employed to further understand such self-sorting behavior, and indicated that the large enthalpy change of H

79957706145	Development of new polymer systems and quantum dots - Polymer nanocomposites for flexible OLED display applications	Recently, tremendous progress has been made toward application of organic (small molecule/polymer) light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) in full color flat panel displays and other devices. However, with current technologies, OLEDs are still struggling with high manufacturing costs which really limit the size of OLEDs panels and with life time, especially differential aging of colors. To be more cost-effective for fabricating OLEDs, we believe solution-processing would be an attractive path due to its simplicity and highly reduced equipment costs. This proceeding paper discusses our recent progress in development of new polymer systems that are highly solvent-resistant but maintaining their photophysical properties and hybrid quantum-dots (QDs)-polymer nanocomposites for their use in multicolor and multilayer OLEDs pixels through solution-processing. Our new polymer systems are named conductive semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (C-Semi-IPNs) served in different layers of OLEDs devices, containing an inert polymer network and conducting polymer(s) including hole transport and emissive materials. Since these do not require complicated chemical modification or introduction of reactive moieties to OLED materials, many state-of-the-arts emissive polymers can be utilized to achieve RGB and white OLEDs. The research findings on hybrid QDoligomer nanocomposite as a good analogue lead to the successful design and synthesis of QDpolymer nanocomposites which were used to build proof-of-the-concept devices showing a good promise in providing excellent color purity and stability as well as device robustness. © Copyright 2011 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.

80052091198	Modifying organic/metal interface via solvent treatment to improve electron injection in organic light emitting diodes	By simply spin-coating the solvents, such as ethanol and methanol, on top of the organic active layer, the performance of polymer organic light-emitting diodes is significantly enhanced. The quantum efficiency is increased by as large as 58% for low work function Ba/Al cathode devices after solvent treatment. An interface dipole between the organic layer and the metal layer induced by the solvent, either from the intrinsic dipole or the interaction between the solvent and the cathode metal, is responsible for the device performance improvement. The interface dipole layer, which is confirmed by the Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy and the photovoltaic measurements, lifts the vacuum level on the metal side, thereby reducing the electron injection barrier at the organic/metal interface, and leading to better device performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a series of two-component molecular networks with a 3-fold symmetry are constructed on graphite using a truxenone derivative and trimesic acid homologues with carboxylic-acid-terminated alkyl chains. The hydrogen-bonding partner-recognition-induced 2D crystallization of alkyl chains makes the flexible alkyl chains act as rigid spacers in the networks to continuously tune the pore size with an accuracy of one carbon atom per step.

The cationic complexes employ 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole and 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-benzimidazole derivatives as the ancillary ligands. To avoid the change in emission colour arising from the iridium complex, the conjugation between the dendron and the ligand is decoupled by separating them using the alkyl chain. An investigation of their photoluminescent features reveals that efficient energy transfer happens from the dendrons to the core in the solid state. Likewise, the charged dendritic structure is demonstrated to be an efficient method to improve the compatibility between the polar charged iridium complexes and typical hydrophobic hosts with the additional benefit of excellent solution processability. Both dendrimers exhibit strong solvatochromic behaviours in solvents and exclusive green and yellow-orange light in the solid state. © 2011 CSIRO.

83755183923	Development of new polymer systems and quantum dots - Polymer nanocomposites for low-cost, flexible OLED display applications	Recently, tremendous progress has been made toward application of organic (small molecule/polymer) light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) in full color flat panel displays and other devices. However, with current technologies, OLEDs are still struggling with high manufacturing costs which really limit the size of OLEDs panels and with life time, especially differential aging of colors. To be more cost-effective for fabricating OLEDs, we believe solution-processing would be an attractive path due to its simplicity and highly reduced equipment costs. This proceeding paper discusses our recent progress in development of new polymer systems that are highly solvent-resistant but maintaining their photophysical properties and hybrid quantum-dots (QDs)-polymer nanocomposites for their use in multicolor and multilayer OLEDs pixels through solution-processing. Our new polymer systems are named conductive semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (C-Semi-IPNs) served in different layers of OLEDs devices, containing an inert polymer network and conducting polymer(s) including hole transport and emissive materials. Since these do not require complicated chemical modification or introduction of reactive moieties to OLED materials, many state-of-the-arts emissive polymers can be utilized to achieve RGB and white OLEDs. The research findings on hybrid QD-oligomer nanocomposite as a good analogue lead to the successful design and synthesis of QD-polymer nanocomposites which were used to build proof-of-the-concept devices showing a good promise in providing excellent color purity and stability as well as device robustness. © 2011 Materials Research Society.

84555177995	Chiral hierarchical molecular nanostructures on two-dimensional surface by controllable trinary self-assembly	The bottom-up fabrication of surface hierarchical nanostructures is of great importance for the development of molecular nanostructures for chiral molecular recognition and enantioselective catalysis. Herein, we report the construction of a series of 2D chiral hierarchical structures by trinary molecular self-assembly with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), 2,3,7,8,12,13- hexahexyloxy-truxenone (TrO23), and 1,3,5-tris(10-carboxydecyloxy) benzene (TCDB). A series of flower-like chiral hierarchical molecular architectures with increased generations are formed, and the details of these structures are investigated by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The flower-like hierarchical molecular architectures could be described by a unified configuration in which the lobe of each architecture is composed of a different number of triangular shape building units (TBUs). The off-axis edge-to-edge packing of TBUs confers the organizational chirality of the hierarchical assemblies. On the other hand, the TBUs can tile the surface in a vertex-sharing configuration, resulting in the expansion of chiral unit cells, which thereby further modulate the periodicity of chiral voids in the multilevel hierarchical assemblies. The formation of desired hierarchical structures could be controlled through tuning the molar ratio of each component in liquid phase. The results are significant for the design and fabrication of multicomponent chiral hierarchical molecular nanostructures. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84055172812	Solution-processed organic nano- and micro-materials: Design strategy, growth mechanism and applications	Recently many efforts have been devoted to the investigation of organic nano- and micro-materials due to their unique properties and broad applications in organic field-effect transistors, organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics, photodetectors and superhydrophobic materials. In comparison with physical vapour deposition, solution processing provides a more convenient and cost-effective approach to obtain organic nano- and micro-materials with various morphologies, including wires, sheets and flowers. In this review, we use the basic concepts of supramolecular chemistry to discuss the molecular design strategy and growth mechanisms of various organic nano- and micro-structures, and their relationship with the corresponding applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

84858014161	Supramolecular polymeric nanowires: Preparation and orthogonal modification of their photophysical properties	A series of three-dimensional shape-persistent molecules with three conjugated arms perpendicular to a planar core were developed to self-assemble into supramolecular polymeric nanowires through multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions. After introducing bulky functional groups, aggregation of the nanowires was inhibited, and single molecular nanowires were obtained in concentrated solutions. Therefore, these nanowires had large surface areas with functional groups appended on the surface. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the functional groups including emission peaks and fluorescent lifetime were not changed after self-assembly. Some nanowires emitted high fluorescence after incorporating various chromophores on the side chains of the three-dimensional skeleton through effective fluorescence resonance energy transfer. For example, 1-BTHex showed a quantum efficiency of about 7.9% in solution, similar to the model compound DHBT. However, in the solid state the fluorescence of DHBT was almost quenched with a quantum efficiency lower than 1% due to π-π interactions, but 1-BTHex also gave much higher quantum efficiency, about 6%, which was close to that in solution. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84858016636	How does a supramolecular polymeric nanowire form in solution?	Supramolecular polymerization follows a nucleation-elongation mechanism; however, after the supramolecular polymerization, what happens while forming nanowires? In order to answer this question, we systematically investigated the molecular packing and growth mechanism of a series of supramolecular polymeric nanowires. We carefully analyzed the molecular packing in the nanowires and proposed a packing model through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). We used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to investigate in situ the growth process of these nanowires. The DLS results showed that after nucleation growth, a mesoscale assembly existed as an intermediate, which then formed the nanowires. This is the first example to directly monitor the growth of organic nanowires in solution. We also investigated the solvent effect on the self-assembly process of the side-chain functionalized monomers. Our investigation demonstrates that the weaker the interactions between the lateral groups, and the stronger the interactions of the lateral groups with the solvent are, the more obvious the tendency to 1D growth. Based on these results, we proposed that an "oriented- attachment" growth mechanism existed in this system after the supramolecular polymerization. Furthermore, single molecular nanowires and side-by-side attached single molecular nanowires were also observed through atomic force microscopy (AFM), which further supported the "oriented- attachment" mechanism. Accordingly, we demonstrate that after the supramolecular polymerization, "oriented attachment" growth mechanism is another critical process for the construction of large anisotropic organic assemblies, such as organic nanowires. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84861357196	Alkylene-chain effect on microwire growth and crystal packing of π-moieties	We developed a facile approach to modulate molecular arrangement through dimerizing of π-moieties and tuning alkylene-bridge length. Dimers of fluoranthene-fused imide (DFAI-Cns) with various lengths of alkylene chains were synthesized by a Diels-Alder reaction followed by decarbonylation. DFAI-C3 and DFAI-C5 with odd-carbon alkylene chains display stronger one-dimensional growing tendency and better crystallinity than those with even-carbon alkylene chains. Microwires of dimers with odd-carbon alkylene chains were successfully obtained, and their molecular packing was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). Systematic investigation of their single crystal packing showed that alkylene chains with different lengths produced two kinds of molecular configurations. The V-shaped molecular configuration was observed from DFAI-C3 and DFAI-C5 with odd-carbon alkylene chains; however, the Z-shaped one was observed from DFAI-C4, DFAI-C6, and DFAI-C12 with even-carbon alkylene chains. Accordingly, we attributed the diverse microstructures and crystallinity of the dimers to their distinct molecular configurations in single crystals. In addition, a computational method was employed to demonstrate the weak intermolecular interactions in these dimers. Our investigation indicates that the introduction of bridging alkylene chains is an effective approach to modulate microwire growth and crystal packing of π-systems in solid state. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

This article reviews and discusses our recent progress in extended development of emissive semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (E-semi-IPNs) and hybrid quantum dots (QDs)-polymer nanocomposites for use in multicolor and multilayer OLED pixels through low-cost solution processing.

The photophysical and electrochemical properties indicated that effective photo-induced intramolecular and/or intermolecular energy transfer and charge transfer were formed from the donor chromophores to the C<inf>60</inf> moiety in thin films.

Energy donors and acceptors were attached to DB24C8 and DBA units, respectively, to investigate the effect of such polyrotaxane structure on the intramolecular and intermolecular energy transfer channel. Our investigations indicated that HBP with higher molecular weight was obtained in relatively lower concentration. AFM, DLS, and SLS analyses revealed that our HBP molecule was described as a ball-shaped nanoparticle with the radius of about 4-8 nm. Benefitting from such unique topology, the aggregation of the chromophores through π-π stacking was effectively suppressed both in solution and in solid state. Meanwhile, the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence characterization demonstrated that HBP exhibited the excellent energy funneling ability from A3 to B2 unit with high energy transfer efficiency and fast rate, which was attributed to the large spectral overlap between the emission features of the donors and the absorption of the acceptors, and the unique highly branched mechanically interlocked architecture. The energy transfer quantum yield of HBP was calculated to be as high as 99%, and this energy transfer process was estimated to occur with a rate of 7.58 × 10

84865555755	Highly sensitive detection of nitroaromatic explosives using an electrospun nanofibrous sensor based on a novel fluorescent conjugated polymer	An electrospun nanofibrous explosive sensor was first constructed based on a newly developed fluorescent conjugated polymer P containing heteroatom polycyclic units. Electrospinning by doping polymer P as a fluorescent probe in a polystyrene supporting matrix afforded a fluorescence nanofibrous film with unique porous structures, and effectively avoided the aggregation of polymer P. The novel explosive sensor exhibited stable fluorescence property, satisfactory reversibility with less than 5% loss of signal intensity after four quenching-regeneration cycles, and good reproducibility among three batches with a relative standard deviation of 2.8%. Such fabricated sensor also showed remarkable sensitivity toward a series of trace nitroaromatic explosive vapors, including picric acid (parts-per-trillion level) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene vapor (parts-per-billion level), as well as good selectivity with less than 10% response to typical interferents. Therefore, the present strategy extends the application of different kinds of conjugated polymers for the construction of optical chemosensors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

Energy donors and acceptor porphyrin were introduced to dibenzo[24]crown-8 (DB24C8) and dibenzyl ammonium (DBA) units of [3]rotaxane A to understand the intramolecular energy transfer process. Investigations of the photophysical properties of [3]rotaxane A demonstrated that the intramolecular efficient energy transfer readily occurred from the donors on the wheels to the porphyrin center on the axis. The fluorescence of energy donors in the region of 400 to 450 nm was efficiently absorbed by the porphyrin acceptor under irradiation at 345 nm, and finally a red light emission at about 600 nm was achieved. Further investigation indicated that the conformation of [3]rotaxane A was self-modulated by changing its concentration in CH

In comparison with traditional inorganic micro- and nano-materials, organic micro- and nano-materials possesses some merits such as unlimited choice of building blocks, low-cost, ease for large-area fabrication, and they have been applied in organic field-effect transistors, organic photovoltaic solar cells and so on.

84872476360	Main-chain linear polyrotaxanes: Synthesis, characterization, and conformational modulation	Two functional main-chain linear polyrotaxanes, one a covalent polymeric chain that threads through many macrocycles (P1) and the other a poly[n]rotaxane chain that is composed of many repeating rotaxane units (P2), were synthesized by employing strong crown-ether/ammonium-based (DB24C8/DBA) host-guest interactions and click chemistry. Energy transfer between the wheel and axle units in both polyrotaxanes was used to provide insight into the conformational information of their resulting polyrotaxanes. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy were performed to understand the conformation differences between polymers P1 and P2 in solution. Additional investigations by using dynamic/static light scattering and atomic force microscopy illustrated that polymer P1 was unbending and had a rigid rod-like structure, whilst polymer P2 was curved and flexible. This flexible topology facilitated the self-assembly of polymer P2 into relatively large ball-shaped particles. In addition, the energy transfer between the wheel and axle units was controlled by the addition of specific anions or base. The anion-induced energy enhancement was attributed to a change in electrostatic interactions between the polymer chains. The base-driven molecular shuttle broke the DB24C8/DBA host-guest interactions. These results confirm that both intra- and intermolecular electrostatic interactions are crucial for modulating conformational topology, which determines the assembly of polyrotaxanes in solution.

By introducing a bulky, dove tailed side chain and thereby suppressing the π-π interactions between perylenediimide units in the backbones of acceptor polymers, more effective phase segregation of these acceptors with a donor polymer (P3HT) was realized. By employing the inverted device configuration to better match the vertical phase separation of donor-acceptor polymers produced by solution processing, undesirable polaron pair recombination was suppressed, and PCE up to 2.17% was achieved from the regio-regular acceptor r-PDI-diTh. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84880491356	Blue host materials for phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes	Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been extensively investigated due to their potential applications in flat-panel displays and lighting source. OLEDs show excellent properties such as high light-emitting efficiency, high brightness, low driving voltage, fast response and potential for large-area fabrication. Compared with fluorescent OLEDs, phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) show very high internal quantum efficiency (up to 100%) because phosphorescent dyes can utilize both singlet exciton and triplet exciton,which overcomes the limitation of 25% efficiency of conventional fluorescent OLEDs with the nature of emission from pure singlet excitons. However, the relatively long lifetime of phosphorescent heavy metal complexes may lead to dominant triplet-triplet (T1-T1) annihilation at high currents, and may also cause a long range of exciton diffusion that could get quenched in the adjacent layers of materials in OLEDs. Therefore, heavy metal complex phosphors have to be widely dispersed into the host matrix to reduce these competitive factors. In this review, we summarized recent progress of blue phosphorescent host materials. Hole transport-type, electron transport-type, and bipolar transport type host materials are presented according to their different functional groups. The molecular design concept, molecular structures and physical properties such as triplet energy, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, thermal and morphological stabilities, and the applications of host materials in PhOLEDs are reviewed as well.

84884336558	Dithiazolyl-benzothiadiazole-containing polymer acceptors: Synthesis, characterization, and all-polymer solar cells	Thiazole-containing electron-deficient unit DTABT as a building block was developed to construct donor-acceptor conjugated polymers (P1). Due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of DTABT, polymer P1 exhibited obviously lowered HOMO and LUMO levels relative to its thiophene-containing counterpart P2. Such low-lying LUMO level endowed P1 with high electron mobility, almost two orders of magnitude higher than P2. Meanwhile, balanced ambipolar transport behaviours of P1 were also observed in FET devices. All-polymer solar cells based on both polymers as acceptors were fabricated, in which P3HT/P1 blends showed power conversion efficiency twice as high as that of P3HT/P2. Further investigation showed that a P3HT/P1 blend film displayed smaller surface roughness and lower crystallinity of P3HT, indicating better miscibility of P3HT and P1. Compared to its thiophene-containing counterpart P2, P1 exhibited higher electron mobility and better miscibility with P3HT, and both advantages may together contribute to the significantly improved device performance of P1-based all-polymer solar cells. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84887228558	Roles of flexible chains in organic semiconducting materials	In the past couple of years, remarkable progress has been made in solution-processable organic semiconducting materials for optoelectronics. The development of novel π-conjugated backbones has always been the central issue in this field. In contrast, flexible side chains are less developed and usually used only as solubilizing groups. In this Perspective, we highlight the effects of the flexible chains in organic semiconductors, including the influences of length, odd-even effect, substitution position, terminal groups, branching position, and chirality of alkyl chains, as well as some significant features of oligo(ethylene glycol) and fluoroalkyl chains. Although the roles of flexible chains in organic semiconducting materials are complex and differ when corresponding conjugated skeleton changes, in this Perspective, we emphasize the synergy of conjugated backbones and flexible side chains, which might significantly facilitate the understanding of the roles of flexible chains in structure-property relationship and promote the development of high-performance organic semiconductors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

0042370508	Synthesis and characterization of oligothiophene-modified spirobifluorene	A series of novel 9,9′-spirobifluorenes functionalized by non-substituted oligothiophenes were synthesized through a coupling reaction between the oligothienyl-zinc chloride and the brominated spirobifluorene. The core is a 9,9′-spirobifiuorene and all the branching arms are affixed to the core in a single operation, which makes the syntheses highly convergent. The tetrahedral bonding atom at the center of a spiro-annulated molecule maintains 90° angle between the connected conjugated moieties via a σ-bonded network, which is useful to modify the steric demand of small molecular compounds to improve their processibility and morphologic stability, with their electronic properties maintained. Contrary to the non-substituted α-oligo-thiophenes, which naturally intend to crystallize, the oligothiophene modified 9,9′-spirobifluorenes were found to readily form amorphous glasses at ambient temperature and to exhibit high morphological stability with high glass transition temperatures ranging from 101°C to 186°C. This series of materials also kept the good properties of oligothiophenes, such as the easy accessibility through various synthetic methodologies, good chemical and thermal stability, as well as the tunable energy levels and the emission color.

An alternative approach to the convergent synthesis of desired dendrimers has been developed, in which the core is generated "in-situ" by acid-promoted cyclotrimerizations of aryl methyl ketones. This proves valuable to afford large-size and precisely well-defined dendrimers in an accelerated dendrimer-growth strategy utilizing enlarged repeat units. The increasing amount of SiCl4 dramatically improves the yield of cyclotrimerization reactions. The introduction of hexahexyl groups onto C-5, C-10, C-15 positions of the truxene moiety greatly enhances the solubility of our compounds. Further investigation indicates that the torsion angle between the truxene segment and the benzene ring might play a key role in determining the photo properties of π-conjugated dendrimers.

The Suzuki coupling reactions afford the thiophene-containing polycyclic aromatics with long branches (about 2.1 nm length from the heart to the periphery) from truxene precursor with excellent yields. The unsubstituted α-positions of thiophene rings allow for efficient halogenation and for further functionalization. The investigation of proton NMR spectra indicates that the hexahexyl groups efficiently prevent the self-association through the arene-arene π-stacking. Chemical shifts belonging to methylene groups move more upfield than do those of methyl groups. These chemical shift values (about 0.5-0.6 ppm) are quite lower than those of normal methyl and methylene groups. We also prepare a dendritic hyperbranched polymer P1 through FeCl

Many factors have hindered the development of quantitative measurement of polymers via MALDI TOF MS, e.g., laser power, matrix, cation salt, and cocrystallization. By probing the optimal conditions, two sets of polymers were studied. Fair repeatability of the samples ensures acceptable results. In set 1, two poly(ethylene glycols) with different end groups showed equal desorption/ionization efficiencies.

Good linearity was achieved by plotting the relationship between the sample concentration ratio and the total signal intensity ratio in both sets.

Nonetheless, high-mobility n-type polymers are rare, and few can be operated under ambient conditions. This situation is mainly caused by the scarcity of strong electron-deficient building blocks. Herein, we present two novel electron-deficient building blocks, FBDOPV-1 and FBDOPV-2, with low LUMO levels down to -4.38 eV. On the basis of both building blocks, we develop two poly(p-phenylene vinylene) derivatives (PPVs), FBDPPV-1 and FBDPPV-2, for high-performance n-type polymer FETs. The introduction of the fluorine atoms effectively lowers the LUMO levels of both polymers, leading to LUMO levels as low as -4.30 eV. Fluorination endows both polymers with not only lower LUMO levels, but also more ordered thin-film packing, smaller π-π stacking distance, stronger interchain interaction and locked conformation of polymer backbones. All these factors provide FBDPPV-1 with high electron mobilities up to 1.70 cm
