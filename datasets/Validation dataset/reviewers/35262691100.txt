23044513821	Progress in researches on unsaturated polyester nanocomposites	Modifying unsaturated polyester resin (UPR) with nano-particles can toughen and reinforce UPR resin simultaneously and improve comprehensive mechanical properties and resistance to heat, water and chemical erosion of the resin. However, due to its hyperfine size and high surface energy, the nano-fillers can aggregate easily in UPR, thereby making the dispersion of the fillers at nanometer level in UPR rather difficult and affecting severely the modification effectiveness. For this reason, the nano-particles are needed to undergo surface treatment before use for fully exerting its modification function and improving its distribution in the resin. Development of high performance UPR nanocomposite with specific structure and properties represents the research direction in the future.

23944503028	Study on bisphenol a novolac and its epoxide	Bisphenol A novolac (BPN) is an epoxy resin curing agent with applied prospect since it can enhance epoxy resin heat resistance as curing agent and satisfy high performance requirement of epoxy copper-clad laminates. Bromo-epoxy resin cured by BPN has been studied. By comparing the two systems, that is EB454A80/BPN with EB454A80/DICY, it shows that the curing rate of EB454A80/BPN is faster than that of EB454A80/DICY. At the same time, the reacting exothermic peak temperature of EB454A80/BPN is similar to that of EB454A80/DICY, but the scope of curing temperature of EB454A80/BPN is broader than that of EB454A80/DICY. From the initial reaction temperature (Ti)' to the peak reaction temperature (Tp), it is about 60°C. It is beneficial for process and encapsulation. The curing reaction of EB454A80/BPN is monitored by DTA at 10°C/min, 20°C /min and 30°C/min heating rates respectively and then extrapolate to 0°C/min heating rate. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is measured by DSC. The Tg of EB454A80/BPN and EB454A80/DICY are 120.63°C and 108.62°C respectively. Bisphenol A novolac epoxide (BPNE) is a multifunctional group epoxy resin and has many benzene rings. Its heat resistance of cured resin is higher for high crosslinking density and therefore can satisfy the requirement of advanced epoxy copper-clad laminates. Making a comparison between BPNE/DICY and EB454A80/DICY by DTA and DSC, BPNE/DICY would be cured at 150°C.The glass transition temperature (Tg) of BPNE/DICY is158.21°C and about 50°C higher than that of EB454A80/DICY. Moreover, Tg of BPNE/DICY/Glass-Cloth composite reaches 200°C.

The curing agent MeTHPA and a highly effective reactive toughening agent were used in the formulation. We studied the mechanical and water-resistance properties of casting parts and glass fiber composite systematically, and the results show that the formulation for the toughened epoxy resins matrix possesses good properties: tensile strength ≥ 86.2 MPa, bend strength ≥ 139 MPa, elongation at broken point ≥ 5.2%. The strength conversion ratio of the glass fiber reaches as high as 88.7%, and fatigue resistance is 100000 times without any damage. In addition, the formulation has lower viscosity (0.35-0.4 Pa·s) and longer lifetime (≥ 8 h) at the room temperature; content of water is less than 0.5% when dipped in water after 180 d; and the cost of the toughened epoxy based composites is just half of that of the stainless steel. The experimental results prove that the toughened epoxy system is very suitable for use in the equipment for reverse osmosis.

In case of adding 30% mass fraction of BN, the thermal conductivity of HDPE/BN could reach 1.20 W/(m·K) or 4 times that of pure HDPE. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of HDPE/BN rose with the reduction in particle size of BN, because the smaller particles possessed an advantage in forming heat conductive passage in matrix over the larger particles. The composite material containing 30 vol. % BN exhibited superior electrical insulation and mechanical properties.

The effects of BN content, particle size of HDPE and temperature on the thermal conductivity of the composites were discussed. The results indicate that the special dispersion of BN in matrix provides the composites with high thermal conductivity; moreover, the thermal conductivity of composites is higher for the larger size HDPE than for the smaller size one. The thermal conductivity increases with increasing filler content, and significantly deviates the predictions from the theoretic models.

40549125360	Preparation of SIC hybrid phenolic resin composites	Organic-inorganic hybrid materials consisting of inorganic materials and organic polymers are a new class of materials, which have received much attention in recent years. This kind of materials exhibit characteristics of both inorganic materials and organic polymers. It has been established in recent years that polymer reinforced with a small percentages of strong fillers can significantly improve the mechanical and thermal properties. Because of the strong attraction between the particles and the limited shear forcé during compounding, inorganic particles are easy to agglomerate, so it is very difficult to be uniformly dispersed in polymers. SiC particles can be chemically modified by introducing grafting polymers onto the surface of the tiny particles not only outside but also inside the particle agglomerates. This is owing to the low molecular weight nature, the monomers can penetrate into the agglomerated particles easily and react with the activated sites of the particles. The interstitial volume inside the particle agglomerates is partly filled with grafting macromolecular chains, and the agglomerated particles are further separated. The author took SiC ceramic as the inorganic component, which has a lot of excellent properties, such as high hardness, excellent mechanical strength at high temperature, better resistance to creep, high oxidation and chemical corrosion resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high resistance to wear and low abrasion coefficient, high thermal conductivity and so on. First, the surface modification of SiC was carried out with coupling agent, then grinded it to fine powder, and added it to phenolic resin during the polymerization process, finally got SiC hybrid phenolic resin composites. The material was characterized with thermogravimetry(TG) and scanning electron microscope(SEM) techniques. After performance testing of the material, it was found that heating 1 hour at 400°C, weight loss of the composite which contained 5wt% of SiC was 4.00%, while heating 1 hour at 500°C, weight loss of the composite was 6.31%. But at 500°C, weight loss of pure phenolic resin by TG was 60.53%. In order to improve the mechanical performance of the hybrid material, glass fiber was used as the reinforcement.

The results indicate that there exists a special dispersion state of BN particles in HDPE, i.e., BN particles surrounding HDPE matrix particles. With increasing filler content and HDPE size, thermal conductivity increases, and reachs 0.96 W/m·K at 30% (volume fraction) of filler, three times that of pure HDPE. Further, Agari Y model was used to analyze the effect of HDPE size on the formation of conductive chains from filler. In addition, it is found that the combined use of BN particles and alumina short fiber leads to higher thermal conductivity, compared to the BN particles used alone.

The results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicate that silica nanoparticles attach to MMT and the MMT delaminates. The SEM images of PVC/treated MMT show that Si-MMT and K-Si-MMT both have better compatibility with PVC than MMT. The thermal degradation of PVC is studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Analysis shows that PVCs filled with MMT, Si-MMT and K-Si-MMT have better thermal stability than PVC. Moreover, grafting of nano-silica onto MMT improves the thermal stability of the PVC/MMT composite. The thermal degradation mechanism is also briefly discussed based on the TGA results. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

72149122650	Improving the aging properties of silicone-acrylate copolymers nanocomposites for encapsulation of outdoor exposed stone substrates	In the preservation of cultural heritage items, the use of polymeric materials for the consolidation and protection of artifacts with historical and artistic value is widely accepted. In the case of stone conservation, application of polymeric materials is a settled technique used to minimize the rate of stone decay and to strengthen stone deteriorated by processes of weathering, effects of atmospheric pollution or inappropriate interventions. In recent years a new class of composite material is offered by polymeric nanocomposites systems, based on organic polymers and inorganic nano-particles [1, 2]. These systems show a great interfacial area per volume between nano-particles and polymer, with higher properties compared to the unmodified resin. Nanocomposite systems based on silicone-acrylate copolymers and different amounts of the modified nano-silicon dioxide (nano-SiO2) (1, 2 and 4 wt %) were tested as protective and encapsulating agents for the outdoor exposed stone substrates. Conservation and encapsulation efficiency of these treatments was evaluated through physical investigations (resistance to ultra violet, freeze-thaw aging resistance and accelerated ageing resistance to artificial climate). The results have evidenced that the nano-scale dispersion of low amounts of the modified nano-SiO2 into the polymeric matrix enhances the encapsulating and protective action of the outdoor exposed stone substrates. In fact, the outdoor exposed stone substrates treated with the nanocomposite systems exhibits a more marked reduction in resistance to ultra violet, freeze-thaw aging resistance and accelerated ageing resistance to artificial climate with respect to stone treated with the neat silicone-acrylate copolymers and B72 polymer, a commercial copolymer ethyl methacrylate/methyl acrylate (EM/MA). © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The samples were exposed in an artificial xenon arc lamp ageing cell or a thermo-oxidative ageing cell. Morphology and gloss of the specimens were investigated by using a microscope and a gloss-meter, respectively. The tensile strength, bending strength and inter-laminar shear strength (ILSS) of GFRPC were tested before and after exposure, and were considered to evaluate the durability performance of this material. The polyester resin was analyzed by fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The results showed that the glossiness of the specimens got worse and some cracks appeared on their surface during the course of ageing, the tensile strength and bending strengths of the specimens first increased and then decreased. The ILSS of the composites decreased after they were aged in the xenon arc lamp cell, but increased while they were aged in the thermo-oxidative cell. The changes of these trends become more obvious during ageing in the xenon arc lamp cell, so the main influencing factor leading to the failure of this material is UV irradiation. © 2010 The Chinese Society for Metals.

The different preparation conditions including the Schiff base structure, dosage and acidity of the reaction medium, were investigated to discuss the influence of these conditions on the conductivity of the resulting samples through two-probe method at room temperature. The products were also characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), scanning electro microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The results implied that these conditions play an important role in the formation of PANI nanorods. Moreover, the resulting PANI nanorods exhibited an unusual electromagnetic loss at the microwave frequency (f = 8.2-12.4 GHz) arose from order arrangement of polaron as charge carrier caused by a nanorods morphology and can be used for the potential application as microwave absorbing materials. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

80051588896	Study on thermal conductive BN/novolac resin composites	In this study, γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated boron nitride (BN) particles were used to modify novolac resin. The effect of varying the BN concentration, particle size, and hybrid BN fillers with the binary particle size distribution on the thermal conductivity of the composites was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging showed homogeneously dispersed treated BN particles in the matrix. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity increased as the BN concentration was increased. This behavior was also observed when the filler size was increased. Experimentally obtained thermal conductivity values agree with the predicted data from the Maxwell-Eucken model well at less than 70 wt.% BN loading. A larger particle size BN-filled novolac resin exhibits a higher thermal conductivity than a smaller particle size BN-filled one.
