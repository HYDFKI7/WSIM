84940297368	Analysis of Magnesia Carbothermic Reduction Process in Vacuum	The mechanism of magnesia carbothermic reduction was investigated experimentally in a reduction reaction process in vacuum. The thermodynamic calculation results showed that the initial reduction temperature between MgO and C was 1500 K (1227 °C) at 50 Pa. Other reduction reactions did not occur between the temperature 300 K and 1900 K (27 °C and 1627 °C) and 30 to 100 Pa. Based on the analysis of experimental results, the initial reduction reaction temperature was 1553 K (1280 °C), and it matched well with the thermodynamic calculations. The gas–solid reaction between MgO and CO did not occur at 1723 K (1450 °C), 30 to 100 Pa. Therefore, the main reduction reaction was MgO<inf>(s)</inf> + C<inf>(s)</inf> = Mg<inf>(g)</inf>+ CO<inf>(g)</inf> in vacuum. This reaction belonged to the solid–solid reaction type, the condensing product was obtained in the condensation zone, and the main component of the product was metal magnesium.

0030103937	Study on the vacuum distillation of pure metals. (2) Basic law and applications	The evaporation rate of pure, Pb, Cd, Zn under different pressure and temperature was investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The comparison between the calculated results and the experimental results shows good agreement with each other: (1) the evaporation rate increases with the temperature-increase and pressure-decrease; (2) when the pressure decreases below a critical value, the further decrease in pressure has little influence on the evaporation rate, and in this case, the surface temperature of liquid metal is lower than its inner temperature, therefore, it is the inner heat transfer process that dominates the evaporating process. The evaporation temperature and vacuum degree needed for industrial application can thus be determined.

38349055037	Experiment study of purifying metallurgical grade silicon removing aluminum	In order to prepare solar grade silicon (SOG-Si) by removing impurities from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si), basing on the difference of aluminum solubility in the solid: Phase and the liquid phase during the solidification of MG-Si, the impurity aluminum is removed from MG-Si by directional solidification in this paper. From the result of experiment, it is known that the removal efficiency of aluminum is 98%, and this demonstrates that removing aluminum from MG-Si by directional solidification is feasible. However, impurity aluminum must be enriched on the grain boundary during the crystallizing process. So, we can't removal it completely by directional solidification. According to the difference of grain boundary before and after etching in metallographic experiment, we can remove impurity aluminum from grain boundary by acid leaching. Furthermore, we have studied removing aluminum by directional solidification after acid leaching in this paper.

43249117197	Aluminum extraction from alumina by disproportionation of subfluorides	A novel technique has been successfully developed to extract aluminum, in vacuum, from alumina through disproportionation of aluminum subfluorides with carbon as the reducing agent. In the technique, formation of the meta-stable aluminum subfluorides, at high temperature, is followed by decomposition into aluminum and alumina. The preliminary results show that the new technique is feasible under optimized conditions. Interesting finding is that if a mixture of coal with different adhesions is used as reducing agent, spontaneous spurting of the mixed reactant powders can be avoided. The vacuum metallurgical conditions are as follows: when a ratio of crylite and industrial alumina is 5:1, the reduction ratio of alumina can be higher than 80%; when an excessive carbon is 3.02 times more than required, the reduction ratio approaches 80%; at a temperature of 1400°C, the purity of aluminum is 92.54%. The newly-developed technique is of much technological interest in extracting Al from Al-poor ores.

74049164729	Experiment research on purifying metallurgical grade silicon and crystal growth in directional solidification	The main raw material of solar energy is multi-crystalline silicon. Directional solidification technique is one important technological process of metallurgy purification technology for multi-crystalline silicon. It can purify metallurgical grade silicon by removing metal impurities and control crystal growth at the same time. In experiment, metallurgical grade silicon by acid leaching pre-treatment, was purified by our self-assembled directional solidification furnace. The sample was analyzed by electron-prode micro analysis (EPMA). According to the results, the removal efficiency of Fe and Al is 96.3% and 96.7%, respectively. The removing mechanism of metal impurities and the difference between theory value and experiment value were also discussed. The segregation effect in directional solidification is the reason of removing Fe, but analgesic effects of the segregation effect combined with vacuum volatilization are that of removing Al. When the silicon ingot was cooled down, lengthways section of silicon ingot was cut and etched, crystal growth was studied. The results indicate that columnar crystal growth shows diverging tendency from the bottom to the top of silicon ingots, and solidification interface shape is convex. The reasons may be the nucleation of new crystals on crucible sidewall is very serious and the pulling rate is too high.

77749329745	Latest progress in purifying metallurgical grade silicon into solar grade silicon by oxidation refining	The latest progress in purifying metallurgical grade silicon into solar grade silicon by oxidation refining was tentatively reviewed in a thought provoking way. The discussions centered on the available equipments and technologies, such as the purification techniques of slagging, gas-blowing and thermal plasma. The strengths and weaknesses of the silicon purification techniques were compared and discussed in detail. Almost all the impurities in the metallurgical grade silicon, including Al, Ca, Cu, B, and P, can be completely eliminated by the above mentioned oxidation refining. However, the gas-blowing and slagging techniques fail to get rid of Fe impurities, which can only be removed by directional solidification. The fact that the gas-blowing and thermal plasma refining methods are highly effective in removal of boron, reducing B-impurity to a trace lower than 0. 1ppmw, inspires the idea to purifying metallurgical grade silicon. We suggest that the continuous equipment on industrial scale, developed by integrating the gas blowing (or thermal plasma) with directional solidification techniques, may boost production of solar grade silicon.

The impacts of the condensing conditions, including the Al partial pressure, temperature, and temperature gradient in the condensation zone, on Al nucleation and condensation were discussed from the point of view of atom collision. The Al powders and beads, grown by vacuum evaporation-condensation without inert gas protection, were characterized with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results show that the condensing conditions strongly affect the characteristics of the Al condensation. For instance, in medium vacuum, high degree of super-saturation promotes Al liquid-phase nucleation; however, when temperature drops to the critical temperature of liquid-gas transition, Al vapor will rapidly condenses into solid phase. Moreover, the temperature gradient in the condensation zone significantly affects the condensation; at a gradient of 1.4 K/mm, Al beads form, and at 19.5 K/mm, formation of Al powder dominates.

Especially phosphorus needs to be removed by vacuum evaporation. and the removal efficiency of impurities strongly influenced the quality and performance of products. In this paper, the removal efficiency of impurities is studied by using different raw material. The results indicated that the content of impurities in raw material had deep effect on the removal efficiency of vacuum evaporation. The high quality product can be obtained by vacuum evaporation only once from raw materials with the lower content of impurities whereas it is not for high content of impurities in raw material. This is due to the vapor-liquid equilibrium in the vacuum furnace. The impurities can be removed effectively by vacuum evaporation many times. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

Three distinctive stages were identified, including high temperature drying or water evaporation, colloid formation, and coke formation. In the second stage, when heated at a 500°C, the content of the fixed carbon in coal-coke remained unchanged, in contrast to the pyrolysis of coal-coke in air at 500°C for 30 min, where a great deal of fixed carbon gets lost, and little colloid is formed. Moreover, in vacuum pyrolysis, the porosity decreases with an increase of temperature, and it also increases with heating time till 60 min. The pyrolysis of coal-coke at 500°C for 30 min resulted in a large amount of colloid, containing uniformly mixed carbon and magnesium.

The solid and gaseous products of the carbothermal reduction of alumina are introduced and the three main mechanisms are presented in this work. It is suggested that the alumina decomposition mechanism is reasonable, whilst the solid-solid reaction mechanism lacks for direct evidences, and the gas-solid reaction mechanism disagrees with the thermodynamic analysis and the experimental results. The possible mechanism is proposed as follows: alumina decomposes to Al-containing gases and oxygen, then carbon reacts with oxygen to reduce oxygen partial pressure, and the Al-containing gases react further to form the final products being aluminum carbide, aluminum oxycarbide and etc at reduced pressures or in argon, and being aluminum nitride in nitrogen. Furthermore, some future research directions are recommended for the systematic interpretation on the mechanism of the carbothermal reduction of solid alumina.

While, in casting process, it is used mainly for the growth of large size columnar crystals in silicon ingot. And good crystal quality and the excellent electrical properties can be obtained in this process. In this paper, the latest research progresses of metallic impurities purification by directional solidification in metallurgical route, the improvement of crystal quality and the excellent electrical properties by ingot cast have been detailed introduced. On the basis of former studies, we proposed a new directional solidification technics for preparing SOG-Si by metallurgical route in this paper. Compared with present directional solidification for purification and ingot casting process, the new directional solidification technics is optimized, which combines with removal of impurities and ingot casting process. The growth of columnar crystal and the removal of metallic impurities can be carried out in the new directional solidification process at the same time. Therefore, the new directional solidification technics is different from the present directional solidification of purification and ingot casting process. It does not need the remelting process and can cut down the amount of quartz ceramics crucible. And the cost of preparing SOG-Si by metallurgical route is reduced simultaneously. This is beneficial to technology progresses and large-scale application for SOG-Si by metallurgical route.
