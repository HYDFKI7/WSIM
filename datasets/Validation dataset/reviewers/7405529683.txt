14944346849	Urea and formamide as a mixed plasticizer for thermoplastic wheat flour	Urea and formamide were used as a mixed plasticizer for preparing the thermoplastic wheat Flour (TPF) by a single screw extruder. Wheat flour granules were proved to transfer to a continuous phase by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Rheology analysis illustrated that during the thermoplastic processing both the extruder screw speed and the processing temperature could effectively adjust the flow behavior of TPF. TG curves revealed that when the plasticizer weight content (PC) was under 40%, the whole of the plasticizer could be effectively bounded to wheat flour. TPF with 30% PC had the relatively good mechanical properties: The tensile strength, elongation at break, energy break and Young's modulus were 2.07 MPa, 44%, 0.35 N m and 20.1 MPa, respectively. X-ray analysis showed that the mixed plasticizer could effectively restrain the starch retrogradation of TPF. And water absorption testing showed that the lower PC was the better water resistance of TPF was. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1542682189	Synthesis and Properties of Polyurethane Resins Based on Liquefied Wood	Three polyurethane resins were synthesized from liquefied wood and three diisocyanates, i.e., TDI, IPDI, and HDI. The liquefied wood was obtained by the liquefaction of benzylated wood wastes using Dibasic esters (DBE) as solvent with hydrochloric acid as catalyst for 3 h, at 80°C. The thermal stability and microphase morphology of poly-urethane films were investigated by TG, DSC, WAXD, and SEM methods. The experimental results indicated that poly-urethane resins from liquefied wood had higher thermal stability than traditional ones, and the special structure and the difference of chemical structure of diisocyanates resulted in the crytallinity and microphase separation of obtained polyurethanes. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

15744373542	High performance biodegradable thermoplastic starch - EMMT nanoplastics	Nanoplastics were prepared using the formamide/ethanolamine-plasticized thermoplastic starch (FETPS) as the matrix and ethanolamine-activated montmorillonite (EMMT) as the reinforcing phase. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) revealed that FETPS was successfully intercalated into the layers of EMMT and formed the intercalated nanoplastics with EMMT. When EMMT content was 5 wt%, the mechanical testing indicated that the tensile stress of the nanoplastics achieved 7.5 MPa, and the tensile strain achieved 85.2%, Young's modulus increased from 47.2 MPa of pure FETPS to 145.1 MPa of FETPS/EMMT nanoplastics, and the breaking energy increased from 1.34 to 1.81 N m after being stored at RH=25% for 14 days. Comparing with FETPS, the nanoplastics effectively restrained the recrystallization of starch. In contrast to pure FETPS, the strength of nanoplastics obviously improved, and the thermal stability and water resistance also improved. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the grafting potential of Fe(III) is the lowest, while Mn(VII) is the highest of these transition metals discussed. The catalyzing ability of varieties of acids, including perchloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, in the graft copolymerization of acrylonitrile onto starch was studied; and the graft ability of monomers such as acrylaniide (AM), acrylic acid (AA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), was compared.

The results indicate that the grafting parameters, such as concentrations of potassium permanganate, acrylonitrile, starch, and catalyst acids, all have significant effects on the graft copolymerization and the components of the graft copolymers, and this offers methods to adjust the properties of the graft copolymers. The sources of starch and corn starch derivatives both affected the components of the graft copolymers, which showed the influence of functional group on the grafting ability of starch. The preheat treatment and preoxidation of starch, as well as the adding sequence of the reactants all influenced the graft copolymerization, from which some suggestions about the grafting procession could be obtained. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The thermal plasticization of starch and its compatibilizing modification with LLDPE was accomplished in a single-screw extruder at the same time. We prepared three types of blends containing different percentages of TPS and MAH. The content of MAH based on LLDPE was 0, 1, and 2 wt %, respectively. The morphology of the blends was studied by SEM. It was found that, with the addition of MAH, the blends have good interfacial adhesion and finely dispersed TPS and LLDPE phases, which is reflected in the mechanical and thermal properties of the blends. The blends containing MAH showed higher tensile strength, elongation at break, and thermal stability than those of blends without MAH. The rheologic properties of the blends demonstrated the existence of processing. Finally, the dynamic thermal mechanical analysis results indicated that, with the addition of MAH, the compatibility between TPS and LLDPE in the blends was substantially improved. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

25844444570	Studies on the properties of natural fibers-reinforced thermoplastic starch composites	As the matrix of natural fiber, thermoplastic starch (TPS) was prepared with urea and formamide as the mixed plasticizer. This TPS could effectively restrain starch retrogradation. SEM micrographs showed good dispersion and adhesion between starch and fiber. Studies in the dependence of mechanical properties of reinforced TPS on the contents of fiber and water demonstrated that with increasing fiber content from 0 to 20%, the initial tensile strength was trebled up to 15.16 MPa, while the elongation was reduced from 105 to 19%. The reinforcement effect was gradually weakened with the increasing of water contents, but at the high water contents (>30%) both the fiber and water contents had no effect on the tensile strength. The thermal stability and water resistance of TPS reinforced by fiber were obviously improved. X-ray diffractograms illustrated that this matrix still restrained the retrogradation of starch when the fiber content was below 20%. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When urea was introduced into plasticizer, both the retrogradation and mechanical properties were ameliorated. The tensile stress, strain and energy break of TPS plasticized by urea (wt. 20%) and formamide (wt.10%), respectively, reached 4.83 MPa, 104.6 % and 2.17 N·m (Newton·meter) after it had been stored at relative humidity (RH) 30% for one week.

The thermoplastic cornstarch was plasticized with novel plasticizers urea and ethanolamine, and the activated-montmorillonites were obtained using ethanolamine as the activated solvent. The structure and morphology of "Green" composites were characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). SEM and TEM images indicated that the composites presented reticulating fiber structure after being cooled by liquid nitrogen. The exfoliated MMT sheets in the composites acted as the inho mogeneous nucleation effect. The melting urea was crystaled over on the MMT sheets in the inducement of ethanolamine, and the column-shape crystal whisker overlapped together. Comparing with normal temperature, the mechanical properties of composites evidently improved after being cooled by liquid nitrogen, which was proved by the mechanical testing.

FT-IR expressed that the microcosmic chemical environments of the group in EPTPS compared to the native potato starch, which indicated that, the strong and stable hydrogen bond had been formed between ethylenebisformamide and starch. By Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) native potato starch granules were proved to transfer to a continuous phase. After being stored for 1 week at RH=33%, the mechanical properties of ethylenebisformamide plasticized thermoplastic starch (EPTPS) was also studied and the elongation reached to 140% utmost with a decrease of the tensile strength. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the typical B-style crystallinity in the native potato starch has been destructed. On the other hand, water resistance of EPTPS was better than glycerol plasticized potato starch (GPTPS). It decreased from 50.2% for the glycerol plasticized potato starch down to 35.3% for the ethylenebisformamide plasticized sample at RH 100%.

Mechanical tests showed that tensile strength and Young's modulus of formamide-plasticized TPS (FPTPS) were lower than glycerol-plasticized TPS (GPTPS) and elongation at break and energy break were higher. The effect of formamide and glycerol on the retrogradation of TPS was studied using X-ray diffractometry. Formamide could effectively restrain the starch retrogradation at three different relative humidity (RH) environments, because it could form the more stable hydrogen bonds with the starch hydroxy group than glycerol. From these results, we found that the elongation at break, energy break, and the retrogradation of TPS were ameliorated by formamide. "copy; 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3142678733	Studies on the properties of formamide plasticized-thermoplastic starch	The main disadvantages of thermoplastic starch (TPS) are their retrogradation and unsatisfactory mechanical properties particularly under wet or dry environments. Formamide was used as an individual plasticizer to prepare thermoplastic starch (TPS) to overcome the facile retrogradation of polyols-plasticized TPS with good mechanical properties or the poor mechanical properties of urea-plasticized TPS with good retrogradation resistance. By using scanning electron microscope (SEM) the native cornstarch granules were proved to transfer to a continuous phase with out crystallinity after plasticization with formamide. By rheology tests, it was shown that formamide made TPS less temperature sensitive than glycerol did in the processing temperature range of formamide-plasticized TPS (FPTPS) from 110°C to 150°C. Thermal analysis reveals that glycerol-plasticized TPS (GPTPS) exhibits better thermal stability and FPTPS has a slightly lower glass transition temperature. The effect of water contents on the mechanical properties of FPTPS and GPTPS was also studied, and FPTPS showed good ductility at water contents of 13%-35%. The maximal failure stress and strain were 3.9 MPa and 95%, respectively. At three typical environment conditions of RH = 0, 50% and 100%, the influence of formamide and glycerol on the retrogradation of TPS was studied using X-ray diffractometry. It was found that compared to glycerol, formamide could effectively restrain the retrogradation at various humidities. The property improvement of TPS by using formamide was ascribed to the formation of more stable hydrogen bonds between plasticizer molecules and the hydroxy groups of the starch.

The ratio of urea and formamide used was 2:1. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies revealed that UFTPS was intercalated into the layers of CMMT successfully and formed composites with CMMT. When the CMMT content was 2 wt% - 10 wt%, after the composites had been stored at a relative humidity of 50% for 10 days, the mechanical testing indicated that the maximum tensile strength of the composites reached 24.86 MPa, and the tensile strain reached 134.50%, Youngs modulus increased from 87.25 MPa for pure UFTPS to 625.25 MPa for UFTPS/CMMT composites, and the breaking energy increased from 1.87 N·m to 2.45 N·m, which showed that mechanical properties of composites were evidently better than those of UFTPS. Rheology analysis illustrated that during the process of composite preparation both the extruder screw speed and the processing temperature could effectively adjust the flow behavior of composites. Comparing with traditional GTPS, the composites greatly reduced the recrystallization resulting from long time storing. In contrast to pure UFTPS, the composites had better water resistance and thermal stability.

Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) patterns showed that in the BTAKC the C-O groups of amylose molecules shifted to the higher wavenumber, while the reactive hydroxyl groups of kaolin in BTAKC shifted to the lower wavenumber. This was caused by the cooperation of strong absorption that existed between kaolin and amylose molecules and hydrogen bonds that formed between the reactive hydroxyl groups of kaolin and the hydroxyl groups of amylose molecules. Kaolin was on the submicron filling transition state and acted as an obstructer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the mass loss of GPA and BTAKC with 20% kaolin were 15.54 and 13.74% respectively, the thermal stability of BTAKC were improved. When BTAKC was stored for 10 days at Relative Humidity (RH) = 50%, the tensile stress, strain, Young's modulus and breaking energy of BTAKC with 20% kaolin were 9.53 MPa, 65.4%, 149.8 MPa and 1.402 N m respectively. It was obvious that the mechanical properties of BTAKC were greatly improved. X-ray diffraction revealed that kaolin restrained the crystallization of GPA effectively. Water absorption testing indicated that the introduction of kaolin reduced the water absorption of BTAKC, which greatly improve the application property of BTAKC.

The effects of succinic anhydride (SA) on the morphology, thermal properties, as well as mechanical properties of PPC/starch composites, are investigated. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows that starch surface becomes coarse, the interface is not clear and compatibility is increased when SA is added. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy reveals that SA can improve the interaction between PPC and starch. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results show that SA leads a significant improvement of thermal stability for PPC/starch composites. Mechanical testing illustrates that SA can increase mechanical properties of PPC/starch composites. The yield stresses of PPC/starch composites without SA and with SA are, respectively, 19.20 and 22.94 MPa. SA enhances the properties of PPC/starch composites, which are all ascribed to the improvement of the interaction between PPC and granular starch at the existence of SA. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

And the other three TPSs were prepared as a contradistinction, including glycerol plasticized starch (GPTPS), ethylenebisformamide plasticized starch (EPTPS), and sorbitol plasticized starch (SPTPS). FT-IR expressed that the microcosmic chemical environments of the group in all these TPSs mentioned above shifted to lower frequency compared with the native corn starch, which indicated that, the strong and stable hydrogen bond had been formed between plasticizers and starch.

33750382005	Hydrogen bond of thermoplastic starch and effects on its properties	The hydrogen bond played an important role in the properties of thermoplastic starch. In this paper, we analyzed the hydrogen bond interaction between plasticizer and starch in glycerol plasticized thermoplastic starch (GPTPS) and formamide plasticized thermoplastic starch (FPTPS), and thought formamide could form more stable hydrogen bond with starch than glycerol. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed that the oxygen of C-O-C group participated in the hydrogen bond with plasticizers, and the hydrogen of C-O-H group in starch formed the hydrogen bond with plasticizers rather than the oxygen of C-O-H group. The excessive plasticizers would form hydrogen bond within each other and weaken the interaction between plasticizers and starch. The effect of plasticizers on the properties of thermoplastic starch (TPS) was also investigated. Because the hydrogen bond between plasticizer and starch in FPTPS was stronger than the interaction in GPTPS, the properties of two TPSs were very different. At three relative humidities (RH = 0% , 50% , 100%), the effect of hydrogen bond on the retrogradation of two TPSs was studied by X-ray diffraction.

These studies revealed that the mixture of ethylenebisformamide (E) and sorbitol (S) was a good plasticizer for corn starch, restraining the retrogradation of the TPSs. The mechanical properties were also investigated of the TPSs after conditioning for 150 days at ambient atmosphere. It indicated that TPS produced by mixed plasticizer possessed better mechanical properties than TPS produced using a single plasticizer (ethylenebisformamide or sorbitol). From the analysis of X-ray, FT-IR and SEM data it was hypothesized that some interaction between ethylenebisformamide and sorbitol occurred, which could prevent the plasticizer form separating out of the TPS matrix. As a result, the retrogradation of ESPTPS was limited, resulting in better mechanical properties compared with those of EPTPS and SPTPS. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

FT-IR spectroscopy shows that alkali metal ions can interact with starch, which restrains starch recrystallization, as proved by XRD. The introduction of salts improves the elongation at break, but reduces the tensile stress of GPTPS. Both salt content and water content have an effect on the conductance of GPTPS. The introduction of salts increases the conductance by a factor of 1-2, while the conductance increases about 5 orders of magnitude as the water content increases from 0.05 to 0.55 wt.-%.

The introduction of fly ash improved tensile stress from 4.56 MPa to 7.78 MPa and Youngs modulus increased trebly from 26.8 MPa to 84.6 MPa for fly ash-reinforced FUPTPS (A-FUPTPS), while tensile stress increased from 4.55 MPa to 12.86 MPa and Youngs modulus increased six times from 76.4 MPa to 545 MPa for fly ash-reinforced GPTPS (A-GPTPS). X-ray diffractograms illustrated that fly ash destroyed the formation of starch ordered crystal structure, so both A-GPTPS and FUPTPS could resist the starch re-crystallization (retrogradation). Also fly ash improved water resistance of TPS. As shown by rheology, during the thermoplastic processing, the extruder screw speed effectively adjusted the flow behavior of A-FUPTPS, while the increasing of the processing temperature effectively ameliorated the flow behavior of A-GPTPS. However, superfluous ash contents (e.g., 20 wt%) worsened processing fluidity and resulted in the congregation of fly ash in FUPTPS matrix (tested by SEM) rather than in GPTPS matrix. This congregation decreased the mechanical properties and water resistance of the materials. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the presence of citric acid (CA), the compatibility of TPS/PE blends were proved to transfer to a high continuous dispersion in one-step extrusion process by scanning electron microscopy analysis. By increasing the interaction between two phases, the mechanical properties of the blends were markedly improved, even reached the levels of the conventional plastics. The rheological study proved that the viscosity (η) of TPS and TPS/PE blends were both decreasing with increase in the content of CA at the same temperature, which ascribed to the acidity of CA was propitious to fragmentation and dissolution of cornstarch granules, deteriorated the chain entanglement in starch, and weakened the interaction of starch molecules. Both FTIR spectroscopy and thermal properties analysis of TPSs and TPS/PE blends showed that the interactions between starch and plasticizer became stronger in the presence of CA. © 2007 Society of Plastics Engineers.

We have developed a nondestructive and simple method based on x-ray diffraction to identify five Fritillaria species used for the preparation of medicinals, including F. thunbergii Miq., F. ussurensis Maxim., F. cirrhosa D. Don, F. pallidifloca Schrenk, and F. hupehensis Hsiao et K. C. Hsia. The Fritillaria herbs contain a large amount of starch, which is a semicrystalline macromolecular compound convenient for X-ray diffraction analysis. The difference in the degree of starch crystallinity revealed by X-ray diffraction spectra allowed the Fritillaria species of different geographical origin to be distinguished. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

The morphological, mechanical and thermal properties of the blends were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis and also by measuring elongation at break (%) and tensile strength (MPa). Blends made with MAH had better properties than those with SA and PA. The SEM showed that they also had better interfacial adhesion. Because of the existence of carbon-carbon double bonds in MAH, it could graft to the polyethylene chains and act as a compatibiliser during the extrusion process. © Rapra Technology, 2007.

34250900276	Production of thermoplastic starch/ MMT-sorbitol nanocomposites by dual-melt extrusion processing	A "green" processing method, dual-melt extrusion, was used to prepare thermoplastic starch/ montmorillonite nanocomposites without organic reactions in the solution. XRD demonstrates that sorbitol enlarged the interlayer distance of MMT during the first step. MMT-sorbitol, formamide and starch were used to obtain TPS/MMT nanocomposites in the second step. XRD and TEM reveal that TPS intercalated the layers of MMT. With increasing MMT content, improvements in thermal stability, tensile strength, Young's modulus and energy break, and a slight decrease of elongation at break, appeared. The effect of water content on the tensile strength and elongation at break was also studied. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

34447523666	A study on some physicochemical properties of acid-hydrolysis starches	Maize and Potato starch were treated with 2.4mol/L hydrochloric acid at 35 C for different times. The rstarch granules after acid hydrolysis were analyzed the crystallinity by X-ray diffraction, the microstructure by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the thermal-stability by DTA. The results indicated that the acid hydrolysis on starch occurred in two steps: firstly a quick degradation of the amorphous areas occurred with the increasing of crystallinity, thermal-stability and the speed of enzyme-hydrolysis; and then thermal-stability and reach equilibrium time of enzyme-hydrolysis decreased with the increasing of hydrolysis time and crystalline disintegration. In the fourth day, the crystallinity was perfect and thermal-stability was the best. The crystalline transition temperature was 87. 0 C and 93. 5 C for maize starch and potato starch, respectively.

34748829718	Influence of citric acid on the properties of glycerol-plasticized dry starch (DTPS) and DTPS/poly(lactic acid) blends	In the presence of citric acid (CA), one-step extrusion processing is used to prepare poly(lactic acid)/thermoplastic dry starch (PLA/DTPS) blends (50/50, %, w/w) in a single-screw extruder. The rheological study proves that CA decreases the viscosity of both DTPS and of DTPS/PLA blends. The low viscosity increases the dispersion and decreases the interfacial tension between DTPS and PLA, as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the presence of CA, the tensile strength of DTPS/PLA reaches 41 MPa-similar to that of pure PLA-because of improved dispersion and compatibility. At the same time, CA increases not only the degradation of starch, but also the interaction between DTPS and PLA, as detected by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The blend containing CA has a higher thermal stability. The water absorption of DTPS and DTPS/PLA blends is also studied. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

The plasticization of starch and its compatibilizing modification with PLA was accomplished in a single-screw extruder by one-step reactive extrusion. In the presence of MA, the plasticization of starch in DTPS/PLA blends could be improved and homogeneous DTPS/PLA blends could be achieved as observed using scanning electron microscopy. Tensile tests showed that the tensile strength of compatibilized DTPS/PIA blends was about 40.5 MPa higher than that of the original composites. Differential thermal analysis indicated that the glass transition temperature of DTPS and PLA became closer in the presence of MA than the blend without any additions, which suggested the compatibility between DTPS and PLA was improved. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy proved that MA improved the interaction between DTPS and PLA. At the same time, the blend became more thermally stable as shown by thermogravimetric analysis results. A novel decomposition peak at about 450°C was detected in the compatibilized blend, which was higher than those observed for DTPS and PLA. Finally, a rheological study suggested that MA could improve the fluidity of DTPS/PLA blends. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction proved that the MWCNTs were dispersed well in the GPS matrix. The introduction of MWCNTs restrained starch re-crystallization, improved the tensile strength and Young's modulus, but reduced the toughness of the nanocomposites. The electrical conductivity was sensitive to the presence of water. The conductivity versus water content relationship could be described with a second-order polynomial.

METHODS: Thermal properties of nine starches from different bulbus Fritillaria were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The spectra of DSC and gelatinization data of nine Fritillaria starches were obtained. RESULTS: By comparing the gelatinization properties of nine Fritillaria starches, we could find that the gelatinization properties of F. thunbergii starch and F. hupehensis starch were similar. F. cirrhosa, F. unibracteata and F. delavayi starches showed the similar gelatinization properties, while the F. przewaiskii starch had the different properties. In addition, F. pallidiflora and F. walujewii also displayed different gelatinization properties. CONCLUSION: According to these differences, the nine Fritillaria species could be identified easily.

35548988038	Influence of formamide and water on the properties of thermoplastic starch/poly(lactic acid) blends	Starch as an inexpensive and renewable source has been used as a filler for environmentally friendly plastics for about 2 decades. In order to improve the compatibility between hydrophilic starch granules and hydrophobic Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), glycerol, formamide, and water are used alone or combined as plasticizers for starch to enhance the dispersion and the interfacial affinity in thermoplastic starch (TPS)/PLA blend. And the properties of TPS/PLA blends are investigated through microscopy (SEM), rheological, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), tensile testing, and Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). In the presence of water and formamide, the plasticization of starch can be improved dramatically. At the same time, SEM can detect a homogeneous TPS/PLA blends. With increasing the dispersion between TPS and PLA, the blend becomes more thermal stability as shown in TGA. It also proves that PLA degrades in the presence of water during melt processing. In addition, FT-IR spectroscopy proves that formamide and water can improve the interaction between TPS and PLA. The tensile testing and DMTA suggest that the compatibility between TPS and PLA is improved in this paper. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

36049051292	Preparation and properties of biodegradable poly(propylene carbonate)/thermoplastic dried starch composites	The biodegradable poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC)/glycerol-plasticized thermoplastic dried starch (GPTPS) composites are prepared in a screw extruder. The dried starch is used, because the moisture in native starch easily induces the degradation of PPC during the processing. The effects of succinic anhydride (SA) on the morphology, thermal properties, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, as well as mechanical properties of PPC/GPTPS composites, are investigated. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) shows that SA improves interfacial adhesion between PPC and GPTPS. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy reveals that SA can improve the interaction between PPC and GPTPS. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) results show that SA leads a significant improvement of thermal stability for PPC/GPTPS composites. Mechanical testing illustrates that SA can increase mechanical properties of PPC/GPTPS composites. The tensile strength and elongation at break of PPC/GPTPS/SA(75/25/1) composite can reach 19.4 MPa and 88.5%, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

36148973559	Influence of citric acid on the properties of glycerol-plasticised cornstarch extrusion blends	Melt extrusion was used to prepare glycerol-plasticised dry thermoplastic starch (DTPS) in a single-screw extruder. Glycerol combined with water-plasticised starch (TPS) was studied as a standard. Citric acid (CA) was used to accelerate the plasticization of DTPS. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that residual granules existed in DTPS and the plasticisation of DTPS could be enhanced by CA. Rheological studies proved that CA decreases the shear viscosity and improves the fluidity of TPS and DTPS. It was also proved by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that starch and glycerol could form strong hydrogen bonds in the presence of CA. With increasing CA content, the rigid and fragile DTPS materials became more flexible, with a high tensile strength. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis proved that CA could decrease the glass transition temperature of TPS and increase the interaction between glycerol and starch. Finally, the water absorption of DTPS and TPS were also measured. © Smithers Rapra Technology, 2007.

36848999263	Polyacrylate/(carboxymethylcellulose modified montmorillonite) superabsorbent nanocomposite: Preparation and water absorbency	Montmorillonite (MMT) was modified with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR analyses showed that the CMC chains had intercalated into the MMT sheets, and the strong chemical interaction between the ether bonds from CMC and Si-O bonds from MMT was the driving force for intercalation. Polyacrylate (PAA)/modified MMT superabsorbent nanocomposites were fabricated by effectively dispersing the modified MMT in acrylic acid solution and polymerizing the acid. The superabsorbent composites were characterized by XRD, TEM, and FTIR. The influence of modified MMT, weight ratio of CMC to MMT, and modified MMT content in the nanocomposites on the water absorbency was investigated. Results showed that the introduction of pure MMT could decrease the water absorbency of the gel, but adding modified MMT could not only effectively increase the water absorbency of the gel, but also improve its water retention ability. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0033639515	Study on degradation mechanism of polyethylene films containing additives with metal ions at a simulated composting temperature	In this article, the degradation mechanism of PE films containing additives with metal ions at a simulated composting temperature has been studied. The hydroperoxide concentration [POOH] in the films was traced quantitatively by using the iodometric potentiometric titration, compared with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The results show that [POOH] increases during the early stage of degradation, followed by a more or less flat maximum before it starts to decrease. At the same time, similar results are obtained by the FTIR analysis. Besides, it is found that the rate laws for the carbonyl index and [POOH] increases seem more complicated, instead of an exponential-type increase in the early stage of the oxidation. When they are fitted by polynomial equations, the greater the rate of degradation, the more the number content of the high-power members in the polynomial.

39249083841	Study of glucose ester synthesis by immobilized lipase from Candida sp.	A simple kinetic model derived from a Ping-Pong mechanism is proposed to describe the mono-esterification of glucose with stearic acid catalyzed by immobilized lipases from Candida sp. The mathematical expressions derived from this model have been tested with several sets of data obtained from reactions carried out at the different reactive temperatures. The predicted values provide very good fits of the experimental data for reactive temperatures from 35 to 45 °C, and the rate constants of the corresponding mechanistic reaction are obtained. The activation energy 19.4 kJ/mol is estimated for the formation of the monoester. The model also considers the kinetics of inactivation of the immobilized Candida sp. during the reaction. Reactive condition with 0.8 g molecular sieves/2 mL acetone at 35 or 40 °C for 48 h is good for the enzyme to keep its activity and for making the equilibrium produce glucose monoester of stearic acid. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

As the reinforcement filler, the effects of CMC and MC contents on the morphology, thermal stability, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), mechanical properties, as well as water vapor permeability (WVP) were investigated. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that there was good adhesion between starch and CMC or MC, but these superfluous cellulose derivatives resulted in the conglomeration in TPS matrix. MC increased the thermal stability, while CMC impaired it. DMTA revealed that the addition of CMC or MC enhanced the storage modulus and the glass transition temperature of the composites. At the low contents of cellulose derivatives (<9 wt%), the greater CMC or MC content were, the more the tensile strength of the composite. The values of WVP decreased with the increasing of cellulose derivatives. TPS/MC composites had better water vapor barrier than TPS/CMC composites. Crown Copyright © 2007.

ZBW starch was treated with 2.2 mol/l hydrochloric acid for different lengths of time. The SEM results revealed that the amorphous regions of the starch located at the centre of the granules while the outer layer of the granules was mainly composed of the crystalline areas. The crystal type of the starch changed from typical C-type X-ray diffraction pattern to the representative A-type pattern in the process of acid hydrolysis by XRD analysis. The above results demonstrated that B-type polymorphs present in C-type starch granule was preferentially degraded at the first stage of hydrolysis followed by A-type polymorphs.

4043106938	The plastcizers containing amide groups for thermoplastic starch	Including formamide, acetamide and urea, several plasticizers containing amide groups for thermoplastic starch (TPS) were studied with the reference of glycerol in this paper. The effects of water contents on mechanical properties of TPS showed that formamide-plasticized TPS (FPTPS) had a good flexibility at the wide scope of water contents, and the strain of UPTPS increased up to 65% at high water content (42%). Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that a small percent of urea could react with starch at the given TPS processing conditions. The other plasticizers could not react with starch. The order of the hydrogen bond-forming abilities with starch was urea > formamide > acetamide > polyols, confirmed by B3LYP chemical computation. The hydrogen-bonding interaction in 1:1 complexes formed between plasticizers (urea, formamide, acetamide or glycerol) and starch were respectively 14.167, 13.795, 13.698 and 12.939kcal/mol. Glycerol-plasticized TPS, FPTPS, acetamamide- plasticized TPS and urea-plasticized TPS were tested at three typical humidities using X-ray diffractometry. Urea and formamide could effectively restrain the retrogradation of TPS, and acetamide could not increase re-crystalline of original APTPS. The properties of TPS mainly relied on the hydrogen bond-forming abilities between plasticizers and starch molecules. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34248137055	Physicochemical properties of starch obtained from Dioscorea nipponica Makino comparison with other tuber starches	In the development of food and medicine industry, more and more attentions have been paid on new starches with different properties. Dioscorea nipponica Makino, which is a widely used medicinal plant in the pharmaceutical industry, contains plenty of starches in its tubers. These starches are usually ignored and wasted during the isolation and separation of the small-molecule bioactive ingredients. In this paper, D. nipponica Makino starch was separated and characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction and granule size analysis. Compared with tapioca and potato starches, the morphology of D. nipponica Makino starch showed smaller particles, oval shaped and dissimilar granules in size. The crystal type of D. nipponica Makino starch was C-type pattern. The amylose content in D. nipponica Makino starch was 26.3%. Significant differences from D. nipponica Makino and other tuber starches in thermal properties were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The starch separated from D. nipponica Makino showed the highest transition temperature (67.4-76.0-81.1 °C) and intermediate enthalpy (18.6 J/g) of gelatinization. According to the viscosity measurement with Brabender viscograph, D. nipponica Makino starch exhibited lower peak viscosity, higher setback and lower breakdown viscosity. Its less swelling power corresponded with its lower breakdown viscosity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

58249095337	Study of the properties of plasticised poly(lactic acid) with poly(1,3-butylene adipate)	Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable thermoplastic that can be produced from renewable resources, and so was considered as a major alternative to petroleum-based plastics for packaging applications. However, plasticisation of PLA was required in order to obtain films with sufficient flexibility. Poly(1,3-butylene adipate) (PBA) was used as a novel plasticiser for PLA, and acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC) was used as the control. FTIR revealed that interaction took place between PLA and plasticiser. With an increasing plasticiser content, storage modulus and glass transition temperature decreased, but elongation at break increased. The elongation at break of PBA-plasticised PLA (PBA content 30 wt.%) could be above 600%, higher than that of ATBC-plasticised PLA (ATBC content 30 wt.%). Moreover, PBA was able to restrain thermally induced migration of plasticiser in plasticised PLA. It was also found that the migration rate of ATBC was directly proportional to the ATBC content in the blends. The rheology showed that the plasticiser could obviously decrease the shear viscosity and improve the fluidity of the blends. PBA was therefore recognised as a novel plasticiser for enhancing the properties of PLA. In particular, as a biodegradable polymer, PBA, when used as a plasticiser in PLA, can enhance migration resistance for its proper molecular weight. Moreover, the area of application of plasticised PLA is broadened. ©Smithers Rapra Technology, 2008.

FTIR revealed that the interaction existed between PLA/ATBC matrix and CB filler and ATBC could improve this interaction. The rheology showed that ATBC could obviously decrease the shear viscosity and improve the fluidity of the composites but just the reverse for CB. With the increasing of CB contents, the enforcement effect, storage modulus, and glass-transition temperature increased but the elongation at break decreased. PLA/ATBC/CB composites exhibited the low electrical percolation thresholds of 0.516, 1.20, 2.46, and 2.74 vol % CB at 30, 20, 10, and 0 wt % ATBC. The conductivity of the composite containing 3.98 vol % CB and 30 wt % ATBC reached 1.60 S/cm. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the addition of ATBC facilitated the dispersion of the CB in the PLA matrix.

4444268820	Studies on the properties of Montmorillonite-reinforced thermoplastic starch composites	Montmorillonite (MMT), a kind of reinforced additive and glycerol-plasticized thermoplastic starch (GTPS) were used in the preparation of Montmorillonite-reinforced themorplastic starch composites (MTPSC) with the method of melt extrusion. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that MMT were uniformly dispersed in GTPS. Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) patterns showed that in the MTPSC the C-O groups of starch molecules shifted to the higher wavenumber, while the reactive hydroxyl groups of MMT shifted to the lower wavenumber. That was caused by the cooperation of the strong absorption that existed between MMT and starch molecules and hydrogen bonds that formed between the reactive hydroxyl groups of MMT and the hydroxyl groups of starch molecules. MMT was on the submicron filling transition state and acted as an obstructor. When MTPSC was stored for 14 days at RH (relative humidity)=39%, the tensile strength, Young's modulus and breaking energy of MTPSC were 27.34, 206.74 MPa and 1.723 N m, respectively. It was obvious that the mechanical properties of MTPSC were greatly improved. At the same time, the effect of water content on the mechanical properties was studied. X-ray diffraction revealed that MMT restrained the crystallization of GTPS effectively. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and water absorption testing showed that the thermal stability and water-resistant properties of MTPSC were better than those of GTPS. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

4444229591	Thermoplastic starch plasticized by the mixture of urea and formamide	The main disadvantages of the conventional thermoplastic starch (TPS) are the retrogradation, poor water resistance and unsatisfactory mechanical properties particularly under wet or dry environments. In this paper, formamide and urea were used as a mixed plasticizer to prepare urea/formamide-plasticized TPS(UFPTPS) with both the good mechanical properties and the good retrogradation resistance. FTIR analysis indicated that the microenvironments of the chemical groups in formamide-plasticized TPS(FPTPS) changed less than in glycerolplasticized TPS(GPTPS) during a period of 70 days. This was related to the fomation of more stable hydrogen bonds between formamide and starch. By Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM) the native cornstarch granules were proved to transfer to a continuous phase with the destruction of all crystallinity. The effect of water contents on the mechanical properties of UFPTPS was also studied, and UFPTPS had good ductility at water contents of 9%-34%. After being stored for one week at RH = 33%, the tensile strength, elongation and energy at break of this TPS reached 4.83 MPa, 104.6% and 2.17 N•m, respectively. The influence of formamide and urea on the retrogradation of TPS was studied using X-ray diffractometry. It was found that the mixture of formamide and urea could effectively restrain the retrogradation and prevent urea from crystallization. On the other hand, both the thermal stability and water resistance of UFPTPS was better than those of TPS plasticized by each single plasticizer (including glycerol). The TPS properties mentioned in this paper were ameliorated by the mixture of formamide and urea(10%/20% weight based on starch), mainly for it could form more strong and stable hydrogen bonds with starch hydroxy groups than glycerol could. As a novel plasticizer, the mixture of formamide and urea would be potential in extending the application scopes of TPS.

The ultrastructure of C-type starch granules has not been elucidated detailedly by comparison with that of A- or B-type starch. To better understand the ultrastructure of C-type starch granules, Environment Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) and Field Emission Gun Transmission Electron Microscope (FEG-TEM) have been used to analyze the conformation and ultrastructure of C-type starch granule from Rhizoma Dioscorea during acid hydrolysis. SEM results showed that the amorphous areas were mainly located interior part of C-type starch granules whereas the crystalline regions were found mostly in the peripheral region of the granules. The grain size can be confirmed to be about 4.5-9 nm from the HR-TEM micrographs. The nanocrystals from acid-thinned starch displayed the typical face-centered cubic structure.

The alternating growth rings (semi-crystalline and amorphous growth rings) are clearly observed under SEM. The thickness of semi-crystalline growth rings is variable and approximately 200 nm apart. SEM results also reveals that the amorphous areas mainly locate core part of C-type starch granules, while the crystalline areas mainly exist in the peripheral region of starch granules. The crystalline and the amorphous areas are hydrolyzed concomitantly, although slowly. The clear lattice fringes with different orientation corresponding to the different thickness of crystalline lamella were observable from high-resolution-TEM (HR-TEM) images. The crystalline lamella size can be confirmed to be about 20 nm with the length of 20 nm and the thickness of 20 nm. The clear lattice fringes should correspond to the crystalline phases in the semi-crystalline growth rings while the blurry regions correspond to the amorphous growth rings among the semi-crystalline growth rings. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

51649084733	Properties of biodegradable citric acid-modified granular starch/thermoplastic pea starch composites	Pea starch-based composites reinforced with citric acid-modified pea starch (CAPS) and citric acid-modified rice starch (CARS), respectively, were prepared by screw extrusion. The effects of granular CAPS and CARS on the morphology, thermal stability, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, the relationship between the mechanical properties and water content, as well as the water vapor permeability of the composite films were investigated. Scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction reveal that the reinforcing agents, the granules of CAPS and CARS, are not disrupted in the thermoplastic process, while the pea starch in the matrix is turned into a continuous TPS phase. Granular CAPS and CARS can improve the storage modulus, the glass transition temperature, the tensile strength and the water vapor barrier, but decrease thermal stability. CARS/TPS composites exhibit a better storage modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break and water vapor barrier than CAPS/TPS composites because of the smaller size of the CARS granules.

Scanning electron microscopy shows that the electrical conductance network of CB is formed in GPS/CB membranes, prepared by microwave radiation (GPS/CB-MR). However, the agglomerates of CB particles are isolated in GPS/CB membranes, prepared by melt extrusion (GPS/CB-ME). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals that CB and GPS matrix can form the interaction in GPS/CB membranes. According to Nicholais-Narkis models, the reinforcing effect of CB is more obvious in GPS/CB-MR membranes than in GPS/CB-ME membranes.

Starch can act as a synergist during the photodegradation of ferric contained PE film. X-ray photoelectroscopy analysis shows that part of ferric ions turned into ferrous ions during the degradation process because of the redox reaction of ferric ions with oxygen. When stabilizer was added, the changes from ferric ions to ferrous ions decreased.

61549092789	Preparation and characterization of glycerol plasticized-pea starch/ZnO-carboxymethylcellulose sodium nanocomposites	Among natural polymers, starch is one of the most promising biodegradable materials because it is a renewable bioresource that is universally available and of low cost. However, the properties of starch-based materials are not satisfactory. One approach is the use of nano-filler as reinforcement for starch-based materials. In this paper, a nanocomposite is prepared using ZnO nanoparticles stabilized by carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) as the filler in glycerol plasticized-pea starch (GPS) matrix by the casting process. According to the characterization of ZnO-CMC particles with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG), ZnO (about 60 wt%) is encapsulated with CMC (about 40 wt%) in ZnO-CMC particles with the size of about 30-40 nm. A low loading of ZnO-CMC particles can obviously improve the pasting viscosity, storage modulus, the glass transition temperature and UV absorbance of GPS/ZnO-CMC nanocomposites.

Melt extrusion processing is used to prepare thermoplastic starch by the mixed plasticizers of formamide and HPEP (FHTPS).

X-ray diffraction exhibits that the mixture of formamide and HPEP can effectively suppress starch re-crystallization, and the original water has no effect on starch re-crystallization when FHTPS are stored at RH 50% for 50 days. Water absorption testing shows that the more HPEP is, the better water resistance of FHTPS is.

70350757646	The preparation and properties of dialdehyde starch and thermoplastic dialdehyde starch	Dialdehyde starch (DAS) is prepared by periodate oxidation of starch, and DAS with different aldehyde contents is plasticized by glycerol to obtain thermoplastic DAS (TPDAS). DAS is characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystalline starch is destroyed and oxidized to form amorphous DAS, while amorphous starch inside of starch granules is degraded. As a result, DAS containing 93.05% aldehyde content formes a ring shape. Compared to thermoplastic native starch, the re-crystallization of DAS can not take place in TPDAS during the storage period, because periodate oxidation has destroyed the crystallization of starch. With the increasing of aldehyde contents of DAS, the tensile strength and the resistance of both moisture absorption and water vapor permeability of TPDAS are improved. It is ascribed to the cross-linking of aldehyde groups in TPDAS. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates glycerol pretreatment can further restrain the agglomeration of CMWNTs. So the improved dispersion and hydrophilicity of CMWNTs are favorable to enhance the compatibility and homogeneity of TPS/CMWNTs nanocomposites. The improvements of CMWNTs content enhance both the pasting viscosity of cornstarch and thermal stability of TPS matrix proved by rapid visco analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that homogeneous TPS/CMWNTs nanocomposites can be achieved when CMWNTs content is below 1.5 wt%. CMWNTs can also form a perfect electric conductive network in TPS matrix at this concentration. However, higher CMWNTs content deteriorate the plasticization of cornstarch detected by Fourier transform infrared. Therefore, mechanical test shows that the residue cornstarch granules influence the load transfer from TPS matrix to the ultra-strong carbon nanotubes (CNTs). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

84886102166	Pea Starch Annealing: New Insights	Three different pea starches were annealed in excess water at 45 °C for 24 and 72 h, and the changes in their structure and functionality were determined. Annealing resulted in slightly irreversible swelling with leaching of some amylose molecules, which was accompanied by small changes in granular morphology and relative crystallinity, but significant changes in functionality such as decreased swelling power and starch solubility and increased thermal transition temperatures, enthalpy changes, pasting viscosities and in vitro digestibility. Annealing led to an increase in proportion of B-type polymorphs within C-type pea starches, which was explained as being due to a polymorphic transition from A to B. Annealing mainly acts on the amorphous regions of starch granules, leading to amylose leaching. The removal of amylose molecules can reduce the long-range forces within the granule and thereby weakening the overall granule structure and leading to significant changes to functional properties. This study showed that annealing is a mild but important physical modification of starch, which can be used as a pretreatment technique to tailor the starch functionality for specific industrial application. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

10444234434	The effects of plasticizers containing amide groups on the properties of thermoplastic starch	Several amide groups-containing plasticizers for thermoplastic starch (TPS), such as formamide, acetamide, and urea, were studied in this paper with glycerol as reference. The hydrogen bond interaction between starch and plasticizers in TPS was tested by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Both the oxygen of the C-O-H group and the oxygen of the C-O-C group in starch could form hydrogen bonds with these plasticizers. The order of the hydrogen bond-forming abilities is as follows: urea > formamide > acetamide > polyols. The retrogradation of formamide-plasticized TPS (FPTPS), acetamide-plasticized TPS (APTPS) and urea-plasticized TPS (UPTPS) was investigated at three levels of relative humidity (RH=0, 50 and 100%) using X-ray diffractometry. Urea and formamide could effectively improve the resistance of TPS towards retrogradation. The studied mechanical properties demonstrated that FPTPS had a good breaking strain but poor breaking stress, while UPTPS had opposite characteristics. The properties of TPS mainly relied on the hydrogen bond-forming abilities between plasticizers and the starch matrix. On the other hand, the water resistance of TPS mainly depended on the plasticizer. The higher the water absorption of the plasticizer was, the better was the water resistance of the TPS.

11144231009	Adsorption mechanism of creatinine on starch 3,5-dinitrobenzoate	Creatinine is one of the uremic toxicants in the blood of chronic renal failure (CRF). It has significance on delay the progress of CRF that oral adsorbent reduces creatinine concentration in gastrointestinal tracts. The complex reaction mechanism of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (DNBA) and creatinine was investigated through HNMR, CNMR, and ultraviolet-visible light spectra. Based on this mechanism, the adsorption mechanism of starch 3,5-dinitrobenzoate (Dst) was deduced by analysing the spectra of adsorption product. It is found that methylene group of creatinine molecule tends to lost proton easily. The reaction product (1:1 σ complex) is formed through methylene group of creatinine to attach to aromatic ring of DNBA. The adsorption of creatinine on DSt in slightly alkaline dialysate could be attributed to the formation of σ complex between creatinine and aromatic ring of DSt molecule. This mechanism is similar to the σ complex formed by creatinine-DN-BA.

13844266197	Compatible thermoplastic starch/polyethylene blends by one-step reactive extrusion	In the presence of dicumyl peroxide (DCP), the thermal plasticization of starch and its compatibilizing modification with polyethylene was accomplished by one-step reactive extrusion in a single-screw extruder at the same time. Because of the formation of polyethylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PE-g-MAH) during the extrusion, it was used as the compatibilizer between the thermoplastic starch and polyethylene. The blending samples were characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic thermal mechanical analysis (DTMA) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The experimental results showed that in the presence of DCP the addition of MAH improved the mutual dispersion of molecules in thermoplastic starch and polyethylene. From TGA, we concluded that the thermal stability of the blends with MAH was improved compared with the blends without MAH. The DTMA and FTIR results indicated that, with the addition of MAH, the compatibility of molecules between thermoplastic starch and polyethylene in the blends was improved. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.

13844276148	Properties and microstructure of polyurethane resins from liquefied wood	In this article, polyurethane resins were synthesized from liquefied benzylated wood and toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-trihydromethylene propane (TMP) prepolymer (as curing agent). The relations of their segmented structure and properties of were investigated. Results indicated that polyurethane resins made from benzylated wood solution have good mechanical and thermal properties. With the increase of curing agent amount from 23.8 to 53.5%, the degree of phase segregation increased, and under experimental conditions in this article, phase transition was detected with a curing agent amount of 69.9%. After this transition, the mechanical properties of polyurethane resins were improved. Thermal history treatment can also influence microstructure and thermal stabilities of polyurethane samples. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
