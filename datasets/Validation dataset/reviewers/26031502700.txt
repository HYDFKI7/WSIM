21344472149	Impedance labelless detection-based polypyrrole protein biosensor	A simple and sensitive electrochemical immunosensor with impedance labelless detection and novel data processing method was investigated. One-step polymerization was used to electrochemically deposit an antibody impregnated polypyrrole film on a glassy carbon electrode surface for the immunosensor. Impedance measurements provided a labelless or reporterless method to detect antibody (Ab)-antigen (Ag) interactions. Dimensionless analysis was employed to successfully process the measured impedance data. Since the method derived unit impedance change to eliminate or reduce the variation of the bulk electronic properties of Ab/polypyrrole films, the signal to noise ratio (S/N) was significantly improved for high sensitivity and specificity. Nonspecific binding effect was studied by array electrode chips and was found out that the polypyrrole electrode without antibody attachment had much stronger nonspecific binding effect than the Ab/polypyrrole electrode; incubation followed by thoroughly washing significantly reduced the nonspecific interference. 10 pg/ml detection limit and superior specificity were achieved by the method, demonstrating a highly sensitive labelless immunosensor in comparison with the detection limit of ng -μg/ml for the reported polypyrrole based immunosensors. The electrochemical immunosensors presented in this paper, due to its simplicity, low cost, high sensitivity and superior specificity, could be an invaluable tool for clinical diagnostics and could have potential applications in drug discovery, environmental and food analysis.

32844474337	Studies on formation and repair of formaldehyde-damaged DNA by detection of DNA-protein crosslinks and DNA breaks	Formaldehyde (FA) is a genotoxic and mutagenic substance. In 2004, IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) concluded that FA is carcinogenic in humans after reevaluating the available evidence on the carcinogenicity of FA. Although many studies have shown that FA had extensive genotoxicity including DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) and DNA single strand breaks (DSSB), most of these studies only discussed the effects of FA at high levels. In this study, KCl-SDS assay and single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) were used to investigate the formation and repair process of FA-induced DPC and DSSB in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and Hela cell lines. KCl-SDS assay was applied to detect DPC induced by liquid FA in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. The results showed that FA could induce DPC at high levels (≥50 micro M). By combining the results of KCl-SDS assay and SCGE, it could be determined that FA would induce DNA-DNA crosslinks (DDC) when FA concentration was more than 25 microM. The repair process of FA-induced DPC was studied with KCl-SDS assay in Hela cell lines and the results demonstrated that FA-induced DPC could be significantly repaired after 18 hours. The SCGE was also used to determine FA-induced DSSB and its repair process in Hela cell lines. The results demonstrated that DNA breakages, which is capable of being induced by FA at a low level (<30 microM), enabled to be repaired completely in 90 minutes.

33845926264	Degradation of small-molecule organic solar cells	Small-molecule organic solar cells with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)\tris-8-hydroxy-quinolinato aluminum (Al q3) (2 nm) \fullerene (C60) (40 nm) \copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) (32 nm) \Au (40 nm) were fabricated. The shelf lifetime of unencapsulated devices was over 1500 h, and the power conversion efficiency reached 0.76% under AM1.5G (air mass 1.5 global) 75 mW cm2. The long lifetime was attributed to the inverted structure compared to the conventional ITO\CuPc\ C60 \buffer\Al structure since the former could effectively protect C60 from the diffusion of oxygen and modify interfacial electrical properties. The introduction of a 2 nm Al q3 layer into the cells enhanced the power conversion efficiency by more than 20 times. The presence of the thin Al q3 film on the ITO substrate lowered the substrate work function and hence increased the electric field in the organic layers, which was beneficial to the collection of free carriers. The reasons for the degradation of such kind of organic solar cells are analyzed in detail. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

33847139465	Role of buffer in organic solar cells using C60 as an acceptor	A thin buffer layer is indispensable for a high power conversion efficiency in an organic solar cell with fullerene (C60) as the acceptor. In present work, the authors proposed that the role of the buffer layer in an organic solar cell is to prohibit the electron transfer from metal to C60, and thus a desired built-in electric field can promote the free carrier collection. The built-in electric field in different organic solar cells with and without the thin C60 layer was studied by the transient photovoltage technique. The experimental results supported our proposal and indicated that the exciton blocking effect reported in the literature might not be the role of the buffer layer. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

33847206069	Preparation of nano-tentacle polypyrrole with pseudo-molecular template for ATP incorporation	Polypyrrole was electrochemically synthesized onto a gold electrode in the presence of sodium p-toluenesulfonate (TSNa) as the key dopant. Under the optimal synthesis condition, the surface morphology of PPy/TSNa was tailored and exhibited a nano-tentacle structure. The resulting rough and fuzzy morphology greatly enhanced the apparent surface area as well as the polymer film conductivity. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was then incorporated in the structure by subsequent ion exchanging. This procedure could be envisaged as pseudo-molecular templating to eliminate several shortcomings associated with physical templating. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy were conducted to investigate the incorporation of ATP. The pronounced rough surface of PPy/TSNa provided a higher density of active sites for ATP binding. The resulting PPy/ATP film exhibited a high charged capacity and lower impedance compared to the bare gold electrode. ATP remained stable in the PPy film; however, a negative bias to the electrode stimulated the conducting polymer to release ATP. This concept could serve as a mechanism for drug delivery and biosensing applications. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

With four biotin binding sites, the incorporation of streptavdin, as confirmed by FTIR and impedance spectroscopy, provided a new method to amplify the response signal from antibody-antigen interaction.

34347232697	Detecting translocation of individual single stranded DNA homopolymers through a fabricated nanopore chip	Fabricated solid-state nanopore chips are used to probe individual single stranded DNA (ssDNA) homopolymers. Based on the analysis of the current blockage caused by DNA translocation through a voltagebiased nanopore, we discovered that the hydrodynamic diameter of ssDNA homopolymer helix is comparable to that of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) helix. This proofof-principle demonstration shows that solid-state nanopore technology can be used to spy on secondary structures of biopolymers. We also show that ssDNA manifests slower and distinct translocation kinetics in comparison to dsDNA. Furthermore, the present study helps to refine our understanding of the ssDNA translocation kinetics through narrower alpha-hemolysin protein pores.

34547356059	Charge trapping and retention behaviors of Ge nanocrystals distributed in the gate oxide near the gate synthesized by low-energy ion implantation	A layer of Ge nanocrystals (nc-Ge) distributed in the gate oxide near the gate of a metal-oxide-semiconductor structure is synthesized with low-energy Ge ion implantation followed by thermal annealing at 800 °C. The behaviors of charge trapping and charge retention in the nc-Ge have been studied. For a positive charging voltage, only electron trapping occurs, and the trapped electrons show a long retention time. However, for a negative charging voltage, both the hole trapping and electron trapping occur simultaneously, and the hole trapping is dominant if the magnitude of the charging voltage is small or the charging time is short. Due to the relatively easier loss of the trapped holes, the net charge trapping in the nc-Ge exhibits a continuous shift toward a more negative value with the waiting time. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

34547503569	Covalently linked DNA/protein multilayered film for controlled DNA release	A stable, biocompatible single strand DNA (ssDNA)/bovine serum albumin (BSA) multilayered film for control release of DNA was fabricated on PEI-coated quartz slides, gold-evaporated plates and silicon wafers, respectively through a formaldehyde-induced, covalently linked layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique. The constructed film structure was well characterized by using UV-vis spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that the DNA incorporated LBL film was fabricated successfully and the amount of ssDNA and BSA in the film could be tailored simply by controlling the number of the bilayers. The control release of DNA from the film was also monitored in this study. UV-vis spectrometry, SPR and AFM measurements indicated that the release of ssDNA and amino acid was adjustable by changing the proteinase K incubation time. This biocompatible covalently assembled film demonstrates an innovative approach to engineer a DNA/protein based nanostructure for controlled DNA release, which could provide stability, controllability and flexibility superior to that of LBL film assembled by electrostatic attraction. Since the film in this work can be assembled on different substrates, it is very feasible to fabricate nanoparticle-based gene therapy systems with this new approach and to have great potential in biomedical applications. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

34547567898	Recoverable photoluminescence of flame-synthesized multiwalled carbon nanotubes and its intensity enhancement at 240 K	The photoluminescence (PL) of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) synthesized with ethanol flames was investigated at temperatures from 30 to 300 K. Broad-band PL emission in the near-infrared region was observed at temperatures below 240 K. The PL intensity was abruptly boosted up at 240 K, and then quickly became quenched and undetectable as the temperature was further increased. The PL emission of the MWCNTs only appeared in the first cycle of the temperature rising. However, it could be recovered by exposing the sample in an oxygen-abundant environment. We propose that the PL emission of the MWCNTs is resulted from the carbon oxyhydride-like fluorophors bound to the MWCNTs surface. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

35548995397	Highly sensitive and selective method to detect dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid by a new polymeric composite film	A new approach was applied to modify gold electrode with a unique polymer composite for selectively detecting dopamine (DA), a neurotransmitter, in the presence of an electroactive species of ascorbic acid (AA). After self-assembly of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) monolayer on gold surface, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used to perform electrochemical esterification with MUA. In general, AA is the main interference of DA detection in a biological system. The resulting composite layer showed high sensitivity to detect DA but selectively blocked the interference from AA. Furthermore, for the first time, an interesting mechanism was demonstrated from our experimental results, namely, that the catalytic effect of AA on DA is limited by DA concentration when AA/DA > 1. The modified electrode showed good reproducibility (± 2% relative standard deviation), a low detection limit (10 nM), a fast response time (<2s), high sensitivity (86 nA/μM), a wide dynamic range of detection (20 μM), and great selectivity (without AA interference). The discovery is very promising for applications of detection of DA in a physiological environment where a high concentration of AA always exists. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

36849054669	Interaction study of LDL with charged ligands for effective LDL-C-removing adsorbents	The mechanism of recognition and interactions of LDL (low density lipoprotein) with different charged ligands on adsorbents was studied. Tryptophan, lysine residues and carboxyl terminus on LDL were chemically modified by pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PP), N-Ethyl-N′-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC) and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), respectively. Due to the effectiveness of l-lysine in the removal of LDL-C (LDL-cholesterol), it was selected to study the interaction of ligand with the modified LDL. Experimental results show that positive charge on the surface of LDL interacts with the negative charged carboxyl groups of l-lysine by electrostatic force, thus resulting in the adsorption of LDL by the absorbent. We also found that increasing the positive charge on the surface of LDL could enhance the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent. On the contrary, increasing the negative charge could decrease the adsorption ability. Thus, different adsorbents containing sulfonic groups, phosphoric groups, l-lysine and carboxyl groups as the ligand were synthesized for investigating the effect of electric charge on their adsorption capacity. Results show that the adsorption capacity increases with the increase of the electronegativity of the ligand on the adsorbent. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mold was stretched and, while stretched, its cavities were filled with ultraviolet (UV)-curable precursor solution. Excess precursor solution on the mold was removed by discontinuous dewetting by tilting the mold so that the remaining liquid droplets inside the cavities were cured with 365-nm UV irradiation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated bovine serum albumin were added to some particle precursor solutions to make fluorescent hydrogel formulations. The discontinuous dewetting and curing process was performed in a high-pressure and humid atmosphere inside the environmental chamber. Results show that protein-loaded particles are monodisperse, submicrometer-sized, and have high water content for high biomacromolecular drug loading.

Room temperature photoluminescence result shows it has a strong green light emission, which has potential application for green light emitter. Experimental results also show that the stalactite arrays have a good field emission property, with turn-on field of 11.4 V/μm, and threshold field of 16 V/μm. The ZnO protuberances on the ZnS stem might enhance the field emission notably. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

33144460672	Size-induced undercooling and overheating in phase transitions in bare and embedded clusters	The correlation between the thermal stability and electroaffinity of a nanosolid has been explored from the perspective of surface and interface bond-order deficiency. It turns out that the coherency of an atom at the grain boundary and the portion of atoms in the skin of a nanosolid dominate the size dependence of critical temperatures (TC) for phase transitions. The trapping potential well depression at the surface and interface not only shifts the valence density of state positively but also enlarges the electroaffinity that determines the strength of the bond. In particular, bond-nature alteration at the junction interface, or bond-nature evolution with the reduction of atomic coordination of III- or IV-A atoms, dominates the irregular TC change with the sizes of the embedded or the III- or IV-A bare nanosolids. Atoms in "superficial" or "interfacial" skins play the core role in dictating the size effect on the thermal stability and electroaffinity of a nanosolid whereas atoms in the core interior remain as they are in the bulk. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

34247520217	Exciton dissociation in organic light emitting diodes at the donor-acceptor interface	Experimental in situ photoluminescence and transient photovoltage results show that the interface formed by N, N′-Bis(naphthalene-1-yl)-N, N′-bis(phenyl) benzidine (NPB) and tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) acts as an exciton dissociation site. Because of this dissociation effect, excitons formed in NPB at or within a diffusion length of the interface tend to dissociate before they radiatively decay to generate blue light. This suggests that the action of the "hole-blocking layer" used in indium tin oxide\NPB\hole-blocking layer\Alq3\aluminium to promote blue light emission from the NPB is more "exciton dissociation inhibition" than "hole blocking." © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The LPF's effective size is 1.3 cm2 and its relative stopband reaches above 143% (-20 dB). No open stubs, high impedance lines, or tee-/cross-junction are required, which makes the proposed LPF size small, and suitable for high power application.

79951919019	Enhanced oxygen reduction at Pd catalytic nanoparticles dispersed onto heteropolytungstate-assembled poly(diallyldimethylammonium)-functionalized carbon nanotubes	Both Keggin-type phosphotungstic acid (HPW) and Pd are not prominent catalysts towards the oxygen reduction (ORR), but their composite Pd-HPW catalyst produces a significantly higher electrochemical activity for the ORR in acidic media. The novel composite catalyst was synthesized by self-assembly of HPW on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged HPW and positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium (PDDA)-wrapped MWCNTs, followed by dispersion of Pd nanoparticles onto the HPW-PDDA-MWCNT assembly. The as-prepared catalyst was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TEM images show that Pd nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the surface of MWCNTs even when the Pd loading was increased to 60 wt%. Electrochemical activity of the catalysts for the ORR was evaluated by steady state polarization measurements using a rotating disk electrode. Compared with the acid treated MWCNTs, Pd nanoparticles supported on the HPW-assembled MWCNTs show a much higher ORR activity that is comparable to conventional Pt/C catalysts. The high electrocatalytic activities could be related to high dispersion of Pd nanoparticles as well as synergistic effects originating from the high proton conductivity of HPW. The Pd/HPW-PDDA-MWCNTs system as the cathode catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is demonstrated. © 2011 the Societies Owner.

42449100493	Supercapacitance of solid carbon nanofibers made from ethanol flames	Solid carbon nanofibers (CNFs) made from ethanol flames were used to prepare supercapacitors. Their microstructure, crystallinity, porosity, chemical properties, and electrochemical activity were compared with the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. The produced CNFs have a unique microstructure with a solid core and porous surface. The specific surface area of CNFs was comparable to that of MWCNTs because of their larger amount of micropores on the surface. The synthesis environment also resulted in abundant functional groups absorbed on the surface of the CNFs. Electrochemical characterization shows that CNFs have much larger capacitance than that of MWCNTs. The capacitance of CNFs consists of both double-layer capacitance contributed by micropores and pseudo-capacitance produced from redox reactions of the absorbed oxygen functional groups. In comparison to the reported MWCNTs-based supercapacitors, the CNF demonstrates more promising potential in energy storage applications because of its larger electrochemical capacitance. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

44649153865	Mechanism of antimicrobial activity of CdTe quantum dots	The antimicrobial activity and mechanism of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) against Escherichia coli were investigated in this report. Colony-forming capability assay and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show that the QDs can effectively kill the bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. Results of photoluminescence spectrophotometry, confocal microscopy, and antioxidative response tests indicate that the QDs bind with bacteria and impair the functions of a cell's antioxidative system, including down-regulations of antioxidative genes and decreases of antioxidative enzymes activities. The oxidative damage of protein and lipid is also observed with thiobarbituric reacting substances and protein carbonyl assays, respectively. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that the mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of CdTe QDs involves QDs-bacteria association and a reactive oxygen species-mediated pathway. Thus, CdTe QDs could have the potential to be formulated as a novel antimicrobial material with excellent optical properties. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy was applied to characterize Cu nanoparticles emerged on the surface of TaN-Cu thin films. The effects of annealing on the antiwear and antibacterial properties of these films were studied. The results reveal that annealing by RTA can cause Cu nanoparticles to form on the TaN surface. Consequently, the tribological behaviors, as well as the antibacterial behavior may vary depending on particle size, particle distribution, and total exposed Cu amount. For the samples with large Cu particles, the reduction of averaged friction and wear rate is obvious. Apparently, it is due to the smeared Cu particles adhered onto the wear tracks. This Cu layer may act as a solid lubricant. From the antibacterial testing results, it is found that both Cu particle size and total exposed Cu amount are critical in making short-term antibacterial effect. Overall, all the annealed TaN-Cu samples can reach >99% antibacterial efficiency in 24 h, with respect to uncoated Si substrate. © 2008 American Vacuum Society.

The mass sensitivity of the diaphragm has been investigated with respect to the vibration modes. Theoretical analysis reveals that, for the same multilayer structure, the mass sensitivity is mainly determined by the mass per unit area of the diaphragm, the flexural mode sensor can work at a lower operating frequency than thickness mode without losing its mass sensitivity-about 30 times higher than that of a QCM. A biosensor with Q value of more than 200 has been demonstrated at a resonant frequency of as low as 120 kHz. Frequency shift in response to captured goat IgG on sensor surface has been detected. These results indicate that the flexural mode micromachined diaphragm has a potential to be an alternative to the low-cost QCM biosensors. © 2008 IEEE.

Essential parameters to affect the impedance of the resultant polymer were studied in detail. Results show that 1.0 V, 0.1 M and 2.2 mC is the optimal deposition potential, dopant concentration and quantity of the passing charges, respectively. Surface topography was studied by AFM and the relationship between impedance and topography was discussed. Spontaneous release of ATP from PEDOT matrix was examined using UV-visible spectroscopy and impedance variation of the polymer modified electrode was monitored with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that ATP could be strongly bound with the polymer in the incubation medium and thus could realize its role as a cell binder in its implantable application. In vitro test further demonstrates that PC12 cell could adhere to and grow on the PEDOT/ATP modified electrode and cell attachment percentage was much higher than that of non-biomolecule doped PEDOT modified electrode. Moreover, stability of PEDOT/ATP in the biological reducing agent of glutathione (GSH) was much better than that of polypyrrole/ATP. Our work demonstrates that PEDOT/ATP modified electrode can be of a promising bioactive platform to be used for implantable neural recording devices due to its great stability and biocompatibility. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

57649231161	Highly stable Pd-based catalytic nanoarchitectures for low temperature fuel cells	The multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are treated with hydrofluoric acid (HF) aqueous solution so as to make enlarged micropores on the nanotube walls. Normally, there are no chemical bonds between the metal nanoparticles and the support. Therefore, the large contact area between metal nanoparticles and the support would decrease the possibility of nanoparticle agglomeration or their detachment from the support. The obtained large micropores to which the meal nanoparticles are attached can efficiently achieve the above advantages. In the experiment, the catalytic activity and the stability of Pd supported on HF treated MWCNTs (Pd/MWCNT

65249145167	High performance organic thin film transistor with phenyltrimethoxysilane- modified dielectrics	In this work, fabrication of organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) using a phenyltrimethoxysilane (PhTMS) modified SiO2 insulator greatly improves the device electrical properties over those with plain or octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified SiO2, particularly improves the carrier mobility, the subthreshold slope, and channel resistance resulted from reduced density of charge trapping states at the semiconductor/insulator interface. The pentacene OTFTs with modification from PhTMS (3.5 v/v) achieves carrier mobility of 1.03 cm2 /V s, on/off current ratio of 1.98× 105, and subthreshold slope of 0.20 V/decade.

65649141667	Dissolution of Cu nanoparticles and antibacterial behaviors of TaN-Cu nanocomposite thin films	Previous study shows that TaN-Cu nanocomposite thin films can have both anti-wear and antibacterial properties. Both properties are dependent on the size and density of the surfaced Cu particles. The present study made an attempt to correlate the annealing conditions to the dissolving rate of Cu particles surfaced on TaN, which eventually decides the films' antibacterial performance. Cu powders with different particle sizes were first used to study the size effect on the Cu powders' dissolving behavior. The results were then used to understand the antibacterial performance of TaN-Cu nanocomposite thin films prepared under various conditions. It is found that the films with nano-sized Cu particles could respond faster in terms of antibacterial performance. When in contact with the TaN film, these Cu particles can have an even higher dissolving rate caused by galvanic effect. This implies that the annealed TaN-Cu nanocomposite thin films may have a different antibacterial function due to the difference in the particle size and density of surfaced Cu. Overall, the results imply that both short and long term antibacterial functions of these films can be controlled, provided that the emerged particle size and density of Cu are controlled. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

67349115416	Medaka vasa is required for migration but not survival of primordial germ cells	vasa is essential for germline development. However, the precise processes in which vasa involves vary considerably in diverse animal phyla. Here we show that vasa is required for primordial germ cell (PGC) migration in the medakafish. vasa knockdown by two morpholinos led to the PGC migration defect that was rescued by coinjection of vasa RNA. Interestingly, vasa knockdown did not alter the PGC number, identity, proliferation and motility even at ectopic locations. We established a cell culture system for tracing PGCs at the single cell level in vitro. In this culture system, control and morpholino-injected gastrulae produced the same PGC number and the same time course of PGC survival. Importantly, vasa-depleted PGCs in culture had similar motility and locomotion to normal PGCs. Expression patterns of wt1a, sdf1b and cxcr4b in migratory tissues remained unchanged by vasa knockdown. By chimera formation we show that PGCs from vasa-depleted blastulae failed to migrate properly in the normal environment, whereas control PGCs migrated normally in vasa-disrupted embryos. Furthermore, ectopic PGCs in vasa-depleted embryos also retained all the PGC properties examined. Taken together, medaka vasa is cell-autonomously required for PGC migration, but dispensable to PGC proliferation, motility, identity and survival. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

67649846625	Electrochemical in situ electron spin resonance, conductance, and atomic force microscopy studies of poly-o-phenylenediamine	Poly-o-phenylenediamine (PoPD) has been commonly considered to be almost insulative at high electrode potentials (in the oxidized state). However, our in situ conductance and in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) results in controlled electrochemical environments suggested that PoPD at high potentials is not only still conductive but probably even more conductive than at low potentials, showing distinct contrast to the prevailing views in the literature (Yano, J.; Shimoyama, A.; Nagaoka, T.; Ogura, K. Denki Kagaku 1992, 60, 1101). The controversy is explained by the difference between the intrinsic conductivity of a material and the measured conductivity of a test sample made from this material. When internal contacts are poor in the test sample, apparent conductivity would be less than the intrinsic conductivity by a certain extent, depending on the measuring conditions. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed significant roughening of the PoPD coating with switching potentials from low to high values, implying worse internal contacts, resulting in considerably depressed apparent conductivity. This AFM observation supports well the conclusion inferred from the in situ conductance and ESR measurements. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

There is a need to systematically study the effects of synthetic conditions for a polymer/protein composite on its nanostructure, chem/physical properties, and bioactivities. In this study, collagen, a cell-adhesion protein, was impregnated in poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) via galvanostatic electropolymerization, and demonstrated binding with the PEDOT backbone and excellent stability. The polymer polymerized at lower current densities shows good electroactivity. Oxidation level of PEDOT was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The results show that simple inorganic anions are more readily to be doped into the polymer than the bulky collagen molecules. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation reveals that the PEDOT/collagen system has a surface morphology different from those previously studied, exhibiting a network structure with nano-silks interlacing. Optical microscopy examination shows that rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells are preferentially seeded on PEDOT/collagen other than PEDOT/LiClO

77950317417	Polarization effects in microfiber loop and knot resonators	We theoretically investigate the polarization effect of three-dimensional (3-D) microfiber/nanofiber (MNF) loop resonators and knot resonators. Due to the lack of circular symmetry, the coupling at the joint regions of loop resonator and knot resonator are highly polarization-dependent. Using Jones matrices to express coupling coefficients, we suggest a matrix formula to describe the propagation of arbitrary polarized incidence through the resonator. Thereby, the polarization effect of 3-D loop resonators and knot resonators can be comprehensively investigated. We find that the polarization properties of the resonance spectrum and Q-factor are strongly dependent on the parameters of the twisted region. Results obtained in this work may serve as helpful guidelines for MNF resonator design and fabrication. © 2010 IEEE.

The experimental data show that the as-prepared PPPA film exhibits a hydrophilic nanoporous structure, abundant -COOH functional groups in the polymer backbone, and high fluorescent emission under laser excitation. On the basis of these unique properties, further experiments were conducted to demonstrate three potential applications of the PPPA film in chemical and biological sensors: a permeable and permselective membrane, a membrane with specific recognition sites for biomolecule immobilization, and a fluorescent conjugated polymer for amplification of fluorescence quenching. Specifically, the permeability and permselectivity of ion species through the PPPA film are detected by means of rotating-disk-electrode voltammetry; the specific recognition sites on the film surface are confirmed with protein immobilization, and the amplification of fluorescence quenching is measured by the addition of a quenching agent with fluorescence microscopy. The results are in good agreement with our expectations. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

77954998076	Reversible hydrogen storage of multi-wall carbon nanotubes doped with atomically dispersed lithium	The doping of dispersed lithium (Li) onto multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was performed by a solution method for hydrogen storage. The sample with a Li content of 1.2 wt% shows a maximal reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 3.9 wt% at 77 K and 106.66 kPa, which exceeds that of the un-doped CNTs by three times. According to the analyses of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adsorption heat and nitrogen adsorption isotherms, the strong interaction between hydrogen molecules and the Li-doped CNTs, as well as the better charge isolation state of Li, may contribute to the improved hydrogen storage capacity. However, excessive Li may result in a lowering of the charge isolation state and a decrease in specific surface area and pore volume, and thus deteriorate the hydrogen storage capacity. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

This class of polymer semiconductors offers not only high field-effect transistor mobility, but also processability from relatively nontoxic, environmentally friendlier solvents. Thin-film transistors utilizing these polymer semiconductors fabricated even from environmentally friendlier organic solvents of generally low solvency such as hexane and toluene have exhibited high field-effect mobility and current on/off ratio as well as excellent thermal stability and high resistance to photoinduced oxidative doping. This is in sharp contrast to most high-mobility polymer semiconductors, which require toxic chlorinated aromatic solvents for fabrication to achieve high mobility. The use of relatively nontoxic processing solvent would eliminate the safety concerns associated with use of chlorinated aromatic solvents, potentially enabling low-cost mass manufacturing processes for thin-film transistor devices. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

However, the difficulty of forming diverse structures and shapes using conventional piezoelectric ceramic and quartz crystals has so far limited their potential applications. Piezoelectric polymers and their co-polymers are considered as the favourable choice in the fabrication of different types of sensors due to their low cost, light weight and ease in forming delicate shapes. This paper demonstrates a disposable and simple piezoelectric diaphragm sensing platform consisting of a flexible co-polymer thin film and plastic sample holder. To test this platform, protein A was immobilized to form a bridge between goat immunoglobulin G (IgG) probe molecules and the gold electrode on the surface of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] film. The designed polyetheretherketone sample holders were applied to fix the piezoelectric co-polymer films. The apparatus was successfully used as an immunosensor and had the added advantage that the co-polymer thin film could be replaced. Optimum concentration of goat IgG probe molecules for fabricating the immunosensors was determined to be 3 mg/mL. The P(VDF-TrFE)-based immunosensor of this type shows a good reproducibility and a broad dynamic detection range. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79955765574	Medaka tert produces multiple variants with differential expression during differentiation in vitro and in vivo	Embryonic stem (ES) cells have immortality for self-renewal and pluripotency. Differentiated human cells undergo replicative senescence. In human, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert), namely the catalytic subunit of telomerase, exhibits differential expression to regulate telomerase activity governing cellular immortality or senescence, and telomerase activity or tert expression is a routine marker of pluripotent ES cells. Here we have identified the medaka tert gene and determined its expression and telomerase activity in vivo and in vitro. We found that the medaka tert locus produces five variants called terta to terte encoding isoforms TertA to TertE. The longest TertA consists of 1090 amino acid residues and displays a maximum of 34% identity to the human TERT and all the signature motifs of the Tert family. TertB to TertE are novel isoforms and have considerable truncation due to alternative splicing. The terta RNA is ubiquitous in embryos, adult tissues and cell lines, and accompanies ubiquitous te-lomerase activity in vivo and in vitro as revealed by TRAP assays. The tertb RNA was restricted to the testis, absent in embryos before gastrulation and barely detectable in various cell lines The tertc transcript was absent in undifferentiated ES cells but became evident upon ES cell differentiation, in vivo it was barely detectable in early embryos and became evident when embryogenesis proceeds. Therefore, ubiquitous terta expression correlates with ubiquitous telomerase activity in medaka, and expression of other tert variants appears to delineate cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

79957960700	An improved MM-PO method with UV technique for scattering from an electrically large ship on a rough sea surface at low grazing angle	An improved MM-PO-UV hybrid method is developed to calculate the bistatic scattering from the two-dimensional (2-D) composite model of an electrically large ship (ELS) on a one-dimensional (1-D) rough sea surface at a low grazing angle (LGA). The subdivision of the MM and PO region is performed flexibly according to the physical considerations. The MM region contains not only the ship but also a small portion of the neighboring sea region where the surface currents need to be modeled accurately. An iterative solution BiCGSTAB is adopted to solve the final matrix equation of a large dimension caused by the ELS. Then, a UV matrix decomposition technique is applied as the fast algorithm to accelerate the matrix-vector productions and the matrix elements filling in. The improved method makes it possible for the Monte-Carlo simulation of large-scale complex target/rough surface problems under an LGA.

A copolymer brush is in situ synthesized on both substrate and silica nanoparticle (SNP) surface to efficiently immobilize probe and reporter protein respectively for synergistic amplification of protein microarray signals. As a demonstration, sandwich immunoassay for a cancer biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection is performed on microarray platform, showing a limit of detection (LOD) of 10. pg/ml and dynamic range of 10. pg/ml to 100. ng/ml. Two orders improvement of LOD is achieved in comparison to the small crosslinker-activated substrate. The improved sensitivity is attributed to not only the high immobilization amount of both probe and reporter but also the favorite protein binding orientations offered by the flexible brushes.

We have designed and synthesized a new class of alternating copolymers containing mainchain fl uorene and hydrofl uoric acid (HF) degradable disilane for sorting and preferentially suspending semiconducting nanotube species. The results of optical absorbance, photoluminescence emission, and resonant Raman scattering show that poly[(9,9-dioctylfl uorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-1,1,2,2-tetramethyldisilane] preferentially suspends semiconducting nanotubes with larger chiral angle (25 °-28 °) and larger diameter (1.03 nm-1.17 nm) (specifically (8,7), (9,7) and (9,8) species) present in HiPCO nanotube samples. Computer simulation shows that P1 preferentially interacts with (8,7) (semiconducting) over (7,7) (metallic) species, confirming that P1 selects larger diameter, larger chiral angle semiconducting tubes. P1 wrapped on the surface of SWNTs is easily washed off through degradation of the disilane bond of the alternating polymer main chain in HF, yielding "clean" purified SWNTs. We have applied the semiconducting species enriched SWNTs to prepare solution-processed FET devices with random nanotube network active channels.

Nickel oxide (NiO)/graphene composite is synthesized to offer a larger surface area and higher conductivity than the pristine NiO film. The novel composite as a photoelectrode in p-DSCs demonstrates increment of both short-circuit photocurrent and open-circuit photovoltage, leading to 2 times increase of power conversion efficiency. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage decay measurements indicate that the charge recombination of the composite-based p-DSCs is significantly suppressed due to enhanced hole transport by the presence of graphene, thus achieving an efficient electron-hole pair charge separation and collection in the composite film electrode for performance-improved NiO-based devices.

Elucidating biological mechanism of the electron transfer processes is of great help in improving the efficiency of MFCs. Here, we reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa could use different electron shuttles in a MFC under different quorum sensing (QS) expression patterns. An electron shuttle (rather than phenazines) with a high mid-point potential of 0.20. V (vs. Ag/AgCl-KCl saturated electrode) was found to be the dominating shuttle in a wild-type P. aeruginosa strain. Strikingly, upon genetic overexpression of rhl QS system in this wild-type strain, the electron shuttle was substituted by phenazines (pyocyanin and phenazine-1-carboxylate, with a low mid-point potential of -0.17. V and -0.28. V, respectively), which directly resulted in an increase of about 1.6 times of the maximum current of the rhl overexpressed strain over the wild-type strain. Our result implied that manipulating electron transfer pathways to improve MFCs' efficiency could be achieved by rewiring gene regulatory circuits, thus synthetic biology strategies would be adopted. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is discovered that the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon increases from Ni-B nanoalloy-doping but much less than that of graphene. After surface functionalization, although the specific surface area and micropore volume of the doped activated carbon decrease significantly, a hydrogen storage capacity is still almost as same as that of the unfunctionalized larger surface one, while showing a large desorption hysteresis. We argue that the surface functionalization greatly enhances the spillover process on carbon based adsorbents, thus playing an essential role in hydrogen storage capacity improvement. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, its growth mechanism and factors affecting the drug loading/release are still unclear. In this study, high molecular weight branched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were utilized as model weak polyelectrolytes to investigate the growth mechanism and the drug loading/release of the multilayers. The pH-dependent growth behavior, interdiffusion of PEI and morphological changes of the film indicate that a pH-dependent polyelectrolyte interdiffusion mechanism is involved in the ultrafast exponential growth process. It is discovered, for the first time, that the fabricated films possess a pH-triggered switchable polarity and tunable charge density associated to the outermost layer, which can enable the loading of anionic or cationic drugs while offering a broad range of pH-controlled release rates and ultralong release times. The multi-layered film has also achieved the highest pH-controlled drug loading/release capacity.

We report here a new approach to build a free-standing biomimetic sensor by covalently bonding RGD-peptide on the surface of pyrenebutyric acid functionalized graphene film. The resulted graphene biofilm sensor comprises a well-packed layered nanostructure, in which the RGD-peptide component provides desired biomimetic properties for superior human cell attachment and growth on the film surface to allow real-time detection of nitric oxide, an important signal yet short-life molecule released from the attached human endothelial cells under drug stimulations. The film sensor exhibits good flexibility and stability by retaining its original response after 45 bending/relaxing cycles and high reproducibility from its almost unchanged current responses after 15 repeated measurements, while possessing high sensitivity, good selectivity against interferences often existing in biological systems, and demonstrating real time quantitative detection capability toward nitric oxide molecule released from living cells. This study not only demonstrates a facial approach to fabricate a smart nanostructured graphene-based functional biofilm, but also provides a powerful and reliable platform to the real-time study of biointeresting molecules released from living cells, thus rendering potential broad applications in neuroscience, screening drug therapy effect, and live-cell assays. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

The results show that coating properties and performance are greatly affected by the flow rate of oxygen. With oxygen flow rate at 4 sccm during deposition, the TiCNO coating shows the lowest wear rate among all. Further increase in oxygen flow rate caused a decrease of hardness, adhesion and wear resistance, while together with the increase of friction coefficient. Also found is that the color of these coatings changes as a function of oxygen flow rate, indicating that these coatings can be used as decorating thin films with wide variety of choices. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

84867935548	Reply to comment on "one-step and high yield simultaneous preparation of single- and multi-layer graphene quantum dots from CX-72 carbon black"	The article presents a reply to comment on one-step and high yield simultaneous preparation of single- and multi-layer graphene quantum dots from CX-72 carbon black. The weak and broad (002) diffraction peak, which has been also observed on other reported mono-layered GQDs, might be from some multilayered GQDs coexisting with the mono-layered GQDs and/or disordered stacking of some GQDs. The observed (002) lattice spacing of 0.343 nm for our GQDs sample might be from a small amount of multilayered GQDs coexisting with the mono-layered GQDs. It is worthy of note that researchers currently continue to work on GQDs and their important applications and all characterizations strongly support the mono-layered graphene structure.

84875783670	Self-assembled graphene@PANI nanoworm composites with enhanced supercapacitor performance	Self-assembled hierarchical graphene@polyaniline (PANI) nanoworm composites have been fabricated using graphene oxide (GO) and aniline as the starting materials. The worm-like PANI nanostructures were successfully obtained via a simple polymerization route. The graphene-wrapped hierarchical PANI nanoworm structures could be prepared using a three-step process by dispersing the PANI nanoworms sequentially into the relevant solution. The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties were also characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The results indicated that the integration of graphene and the worm-like PANI nanocomposites possessed excellent electrochemical properties. These hierarchical worm-like graphene@PANI nanostructures could afford an interconnected network with a lot of well-defined nanopores, and further provided more active sites and excellent electron transfer path for improving the electric conductivity as well as good mechanical properties. Supercapacitor devices based on these self-assembled nanocomposites showed high electrochemical capacitance (488.2 F g

The object suited above is assumed to be a perfect electric conductor (PEC) while the rough surface is dielectric. Firstly, the Poggio, Miller, Chang, Harrington, Wu and Tsai (PMCHWT) integral equations, electric field integral equation (EFIE) are implemented and extended on the rough surface and on the surface of the object respectively. Then, the method of moments (MoM) combined with Galerkin method is introduced to discretize the integral equations to the matrix form using RWG basis function. Due to the memory requirement and computational complexity of traditional MOM are O(N

In particular, novel nanomaterials with unique physical and chemical properties have been synthesized for electroanalysis in micro- and nano-scales to qualitatively and/or quantitatively examine the changes of compositions and structures for scientific insights and practical applications. In this review, we mainly survey our recent works on electroanalysis in micro- and nano-scales, which covers micro- and nano-fabrication techniques, microelectrodes and powder microelectrodes, direct electrochemistry of proteins, electrochemical analysis of living cells, and electrochemical immunoassay, with emphasis on the performance improvement by engineered functional nanomaterials. These electroanalytical methods have demonstrated their ability and reliability to study fundamental science and provide practical applications. It is our intention that this review could attract increasing interest to explore new electroanalytical methods in micro- and nano-scales and further develop broad important applications for critical chemical/biological sciences. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

0042410704	Synthesis of Ti(C, N, O) coatings by unbalanced magnetron sputtering	Several TiCNO coatings were deposited using an unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The composition of C, N, O was first studied using GDOS (glow discharge optical spectrometer). The coating properties as a function of oxygen/nitrogen flow ratio were then studied by using SEM, scratch testing and nano-indentation measurement. The tribological properties of the coatings were then investigated using a ball-on-disk setup with alumina balls. The sliding speeds were set at 10, 20, and 30cm/min. The results show that coating properties and performance are greatly affected by the flow rate of oxygen. With oxygen flow rate set at 4sccm during deposition, the TiCNO coating shows the lowest wear rate and friction coefficient among all. Further increase in oxygen flow rate caused a decrease of wear resistance with the increase of friction coefficient. The wear debris were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. The tribological behavior of the selected TiCNO coating was also compared with other Ti-based hard coatings. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
