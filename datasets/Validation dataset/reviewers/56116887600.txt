84931353141	Minimizing the total service time of discrete dynamic berth allocation problem by an iterated greedy heuristic	Berth allocation is the forefront operation performed when ships arrive at a port and is a critical task in container port optimization. Minimizing the time ships spend at berths constitutes an important objective of berth allocation problems. This study focuses on the discrete dynamic berth allocation problem (discrete DBAP), which aims to minimize total service time, and proposes an iterated greedy (IG) algorithm to solve it. The proposed IG algorithm is tested on three benchmark problem sets. Experimental results show that the proposed IG algorithm can obtain optimal solutions for all test instances of the first and second problem sets and outperforms the best-known solutions for 35 out of 90 test instances of the third problem set.

34548119542	Vehicle routing problems with time windows using simulated annealing	In recent years, supply chain management is paid attention to every large enterprise. Enterprise reduces their transporting and distributing cost through the manner of subcontractors and shared transportation. The customer request for sending time of the goods is getting more strictly; it can be solved in the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). Because the constraints of VRPTW include the length of each route, loading capacity of vehicle and the available time window for each customer, it is more complex than travel salesperson problem and vehicle routing problem (VRP). This research applied the simulated annealing (SA) combined with local search for solving the VRPTW. The developed approach can escape from the local optimal traps, and the use of exchange and insertion local search can find out the (near) optimal solution quickly and efficiently. The Solomon's benchmark instances are used for verifying the developed approach. AU problems have 100 customers, a delivery depot, constraints of loading capacity and time window. The developed approach finds all the best results in the C set, and find out 4 solutions which are equal to the best solutions found so far in R set and RC set at reasonable computational time. The developed approach finds the average number of vehicles and route costs in most classes are better than or equal to those of previous researches. Therefore, the developed approach can be used to solve the VRPTW effectively. © 2006 IEEE.

34548134495	Applying simulated annealing approach for capacitated vehicle routing problems	The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is one of the elemental problems in supply chain management. The objective of CVRP is to deliver a set of customers with known demands on minimum-cost vehicle routes originating and terminating at a delivery depot. CVRP is a difficult combinatorial problem, since it contains both the bin packing problem and the traveling salesperson problem as special cases. A simulated annealing combining local search approach is developed in this research to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problems. Computational results are reported on a sample of fourteen benchmark problems which have different settings. The developed approach obtained six solutions which are equal to the best solution found so far using the reasonable computing time. And the solutions obtained have the smaller relative deviation percentage (RDP) when compared with the best solution found so far in the literature. Therefore, the developed approach can perform well in different problem settings. © 2006 IEEE.

48749109333	Particle swarm optimization for parameter determination and feature selection of support vector machines	Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular pattern classification method with many diverse applications. Kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, along with the feature selection, significantly influences the classification accuracy. This study simultaneously determines the parameter values while discovering a subset of features, without reducing SVM classification accuracy. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) based approach for parameter determination and feature selection of the SVM, termed PSO + SVM, is developed. Several public datasets are employed to calculate the classification accuracy rate in order to evaluate the developed PSO + SVM approach. The developed approach was compared with grid search, which is a conventional method of searching parameter values, and other approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the classification accuracy rates of the developed approach surpass those of grid search and many other approaches, and that the developed PSO + SVM approach has a similar result to GA + SVM. Therefore, the PSO + SVM approach is valuable for parameter determination and feature selection in an SVM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to computational complexity, almost all published studies focus on using permutation schedules to deal with this problem. To explore the potential effectiveness of treating this argument using non-permutation schedules, three prominent types of metaheuristics-a simulated annealing, a genetic algorithm and a tabu search-are proposed and empirically evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that in general, the improvement made by non-permutation schedules over permutation schedules for the due-date-based performance criteria were significantly better than that for the completion-time-based criteria. The results of this study will provide practitioners a guideline as to when to adopt a non-permutation schedule, which may exhibit better performance with additional computational efforts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

61349164301	Hybrid-directional planning: Improving improvement heuristics for scheduling resource-constrained projects	The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) has been of a continuing interest and challenge for researchers and practitioners since its advent. The formidable computational requirements of the RCPSP have resulted in numerous attempts to develop heuristic procedures, leading to the interest in improvement heuristics. Traditionally, such heuristics constructed a schedule by the scheme of forward, backward, or bidirectional planning directions. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid-directional planning that can make all improvement heuristics (e.g., meta-heuristics) more effective in solving the RCPSP. To validate its effectiveness, the proposed scheme is incorporated into three popular meta-heuristics, including genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. A comprehensive numerical investigation shows that the performance of such meta-heuristics is significantly increased by using the hybrid-directional planning, which indicates that such a hybrid planning direction will hopefully encourage researchers and practitioners to apply it to different improvement heuristics for solving the RCPSP. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

75849159242	An enhanced ant colony optimization (EACO) applied to capacitated vehicle routing problem	In this paper, an enhanced ant colony optimization (EACO) is proposed for capacitated vehicle routing problem. The capacitated vehicle routing problem is to service customers with known demands by a homogeneous fleet of fixed capacity vehicles starting from a depot. It plays a major role in the field of logistics and belongs to NP-hard problems. Therefore, it is difficult to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem directly when solutions increase exponentially with the number of serviced customers. The framework of this paper is to develop an enhanced ant colony optimization for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. It takes the advantages of simulated annealing and ant colony optimization for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem. In the proposed algorithm, simulated annealing provides a good initial solution for ant colony optimization. Furthermore, an information gain based ant colony optimization is used to ameliorate the search performance.

77956232385	Applying PSO-based BPN for predicting the yield rate of DRAM modules produced using defective ICs	Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) modules are an important component of electronic equipment, impacting the quality, performance, and price of the final product. A typical DRAM module is composed of DRAM integrated circuits (ICs). DRAM ICs of higher quality can be used to produce DRAM modules of higher quality. However, high-quality DRAM ICs are more costly. Some DRAM module manufacturers purchase batches of DRAM ICs containing defective units and then have the batch tested in order to select DRAM ICs for production of DRAM modules. This type of DRAM module is suitable only for products not intended for work in harsh environments or being sold in lower price markets. Due to the lower quality of the DRAM ICs, the actual quality of the DRAM module is not easily predicted. Predicting the yield rate of the DRAM module is thus an important issue for DRAM module manufacturers who purchase DRAM ICs of lower quality. This study uses a back-propagation neural network (BPN) to predict the yield rate of the DRAM modules produced using defective DRAM ICs. BPN is a very capable method and has been successfully applied across many fields. However, network parameters and input features differ depending on the application. Thus, a particle swarm optimization approach is proposed to obtain suitable parameters for the BPN and to select beneficial subsets of features which result in a better prediction of the DRAM module yield rate. The experimental results showed that it outperforms traditional stepwise regression analysis. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

81555219465	Robust scheduling on a single machine to minimize total flow time	In a real-world manufacturing environment featuring a variety of uncertainties, production schedules for manufacturing systems often cannot be executed exactly as they are developed. In these environments, schedule robustness that guarantees the best worst-case performance is a more appropriate criterion in developing schedules, although most existing studies have developed optimal schedules with respect to a deterministic or stochastic scheduling model. This study concerns robust single machine scheduling with uncertain job processing times and sequence-dependent family setup times explicitly represented by interval data. The objective is to obtain robust sequences of job families and jobs within each family that minimize the absolute deviation of total flow time from the optimal solution under the worst-case scenario. We prove that the robust single machine scheduling problem of interest is NP-hard. This problem is reformulated as a robust constrained shortest path problem and solved by a simulated annealing-based algorithmic framework that embeds a generalized label correcting method. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic is effective and efficient for determining robust schedules. In addition, we explore the impact of degree of uncertainty on the performance measures and examine the tradeoff between robustness and optimality. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper evaluates the performance of the low cost Sn-Cu-Ni solder alloy used for wave soldering. Sample products for several applications are used to assess critical factors in the wave soldering process. A principal component analysis was performed in this paper to integrate multiple quality characteristics, namely assembly yield and solder joint strength, for process development. As a result, a parameter combination of 270 rm C soldering temperature and 8 s dwell time is recommended. A test vehicle with daisy-chain circuitry design is used to investigate the performance of samples prepared by the optimal process. Samples are subject to the thermal cycling test. The performance of the recommended process is therefore verified. © 2011 IEEE.

84863036816	The solder paste printing process: Critical parameters, defect scenarios, specifications, and cost reduction	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively explore the effects of critical parameters on solder deposition and to establish a systematic approach for determining guidelines for solder paste inspection (SPI) workstations. Design/methodology/approach This study explored the effects of process parameters, stencil and printed circuit board designs on solder deposition and identified the major post-reflow defect scenarios. Through the investigation of correlation between the results of SPI analysis and post-reflow defective scenarios, SPI specifications are suggested for minimizing the total cost of poor quality. Findings The higher the printing pressure the lower the solder deposition. There was a significant difference in solder deposition between the front squeegee and the rear squeegee. Insufficient distance between the stencil aperture and the initial printing location resulted in irregular solder paste and variations in solder deposition. A stencil with a higher area ratio resulted in greater solder deposition and less variation. Stencil apertures parallel to the direction of printing were superior to a 45 vector print. Further, the nominal solder thickness should take into account the thicknesses of the solder mask and the legend ink. There was an offset in the results of SPI measurements between the solder mask defined (SMD) pads and non-SMD pads. The specifications for solder deposition with irregular stencil apertures need to be adjusted. Originality/value To address the arbitrariness of existing industry practice, this study was a joint effort with a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturing service company. Real data were taken from a mass production environment and inferences were then made based on a statistical analysis. © Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

84863648938	Scheduling a bi-criteria flowshop manufacturing cell with sequence-dependent family setup times	Flowshop manufacturing cell scheduling problems (FMCSPs) with sequence-dependent family setup times (SDFSTs) have become a key area in the field of scheduling. Though the need to consider multiple criteria in real-world scheduling is widely recognised, most of the currently available algorithms for FMCSPs with SDFSTs only deal with the optimisation of a single performance criterion. In this study, a two-level multi-start simulated annealing (TLMSA) heuristic was presented for this problem with the objectives of simultaneously minimising makespan and total flow time (or total tardiness). To validate the performance of the proposed approach, the obtained sets of non-dominated solutions were evaluated by seven multi-objective performance indicators. The computational results showed that the proposed TLMSA significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithm in terms of the seven performance indicators. It is believed that it can serve as a new benchmark approach for future research on the two FMCSPs with SDFSTs addressed in this study. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

84864772502	An intelligent algorithm with feature selection and decision rules applied to anomaly intrusion detection	Intrusion detection system (IDS) is to monitor the attacks occurring in the computer or networks. Anomaly intrusion detection plays an important role in IDS to detect new attacks by detecting any deviation from the normal profile. In this paper, an intelligent algorithm with feature selection and decision rules applied to anomaly intrusion detection is proposed. The key idea is to take the advantage of support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and simulated annealing (SA). In the proposed algorithm, SVM and SA can find the best selected features to elevate the accuracy of anomaly intrusion detection. By analyzing the information from using KDD'99 dataset, DT and SA can obtain decision rules for new attacks and can improve accuracy of classification. In addition, the best parameter settings for the DT and SVM are automatically adjusted by SA. The proposed algorithm outperforms other existing approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is successful in detecting anomaly intrusion detection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84866007542	Minimizing total flow time in permutation flowshop environment	The permutation flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing total flow time is known as a NP-hard problem, even for the two-machine cases. Because of the computational complexity of this problem, a multi-start simulated annealing (MSA) heuristic, which adopts a multi-start hill climbing strategy in the simulated annealing (SA) heuristic, is proposed to obtain close-to-optimal solutions. To examine the performance of the MSA algorithm, a set of computational experiments was conducted, on a well-known benchmark-problem set from the literature. The experiment results show that the performance of the traditional single-start SA can be significantly improved by incorporating the multi-start hill climbing strategy. In addition, the proposed MSA algorithm is highly effective and efficient as compared with the other state-of-the-art metaheuristics on the same benchmark-problem instances. In terms of both solution quality and computational expense, the proposed algorithm contributes significantly to this extremely challenging scheduling problem. © ICIC International 2012.

0142258724	An ant colony system approach for scheduling problems	Over the past 50 years, researchers have developed many simple constructive heuristics for the scheduling problem. A major defect of these heuristics is the non-robustness of their solutions. An ant colony system (ACS) approach is presented to continuously improve the constructive heuristics. To verify the developed ACS approach, a computational study is conducted on the single machine total weighted tardiness problem. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively improve the robustness of various constructive heuristics, and outperform the existing heuristics for a well-known benchmark problem set. From the viewpoints of both the solution quality and computational expenses, the proposed ACS approach is an efficient and effective method for scheduling problems.

84902127318	Robust single machine scheduling for minimizing total flow time in the presence of uncertain processing times	This research deals with the single machine scheduling problem (SMSP) with uncertain job processing times. The single machine robust scheduling problem (SMRSP) aims to obtain robust job sequences with minimum worst-case total flow time. We describe uncertain processing times using intervals, and adopt an uncertainty set that incorporates a budget parameter to control the degree of conservatism. A revision of the uncertainty set is also proposed to address correlated uncertain processing times due to a number of common sources of uncertainty. A mixed integer linear program is developed for the SMRSP, where a linear program for determining the worst-case total flow time is integrated within the conventional integer program of the SMSP. To efficiently solve the SMRSP, a simple iterative improvement (SII) heuristic and a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic are developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SII and SA heuristics are effective and efficient in solving SMRSP with practical problem sizes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
