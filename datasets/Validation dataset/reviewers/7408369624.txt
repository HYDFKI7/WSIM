84940675900	Model-based tendon segmentation from ultrasound images	In orthopedics, trigger finger is one of the popular occupational hazards in recent years. Ultrasound images are usually used for diagnosing the severity of trigger finger clinically. Finger ultrasound image has two important characteristics: the shape of tendon is close to an ellipse, and the tendon boundaries vary significantly in image appearance. The traditional segmentation methods usually cannot segment the tendon well. In this study, we develop an ultrasound image detection and estimation system that can assist clinician to locate and evaluate the area of tendon and synovial sheath automatically. An adaptive texture-based active shape model (ATASM) method is proposed to overcome the complex segmentation problems with the proposed shape model by minimizing the objective function based on gradient and texture information. Considering the segmentation may have many local solutions due to various image qualities, the genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to search for the best shape parameters. In the experiments, the results of tendon segmentation are found with small segmentation errors and similar to the contour drawn by trained users.

84947429867	The assessment of chronic liver diseases by sonography	This paper describes a new ultrasonic scoring system based on the texture characteristics of ultrasonic liver images. This system generates an ultrasonic disease severity (UDS) score that is highly correlated with the computer morphometry (CM) score obtained from the evaluation of liver fibrosis based on the biopsy specimens. Essentially, UDS score is very similar to the CM score in the statistical presentation. Therefore, UDS score is defined mathematically referring to CM score as the scoring basis. As a result, UDS can faithfully reflect the disease progression that is determined conventionally based on the evaluation of liver fibrosis. Promising results have been obtained in experimental studies, and it will currently undergoes extensive clinical experiments.

1942504141	Comparison of Adaptive Cancellation and Laplacian Operation in Removing Eye Blinking Artifacts in EEG	The long-term goal of our project is to develop a brain computer interface for locked-in patients. In this study, we designed a controlled experiment and compared the efficacy of real-time adaptive cancellation and Laplacian operation in removing eye blinking artifacts in EEG. Scalp EEG was recorded while the subject performed thumb movements in three different states of eye blinking, i.e., persisted eye opening, persisted eye closure and natural blinking. The collected data were preprocessed with one of three preprocessing algorithms, namely, adaptive cancellation, Laplacian operation and null and, then, passed through windowed Fourier transform to calculate the change of wave power. Templates of wave power were derived by averaging the whole set. Correlation coefficients of templates and single-pass experimental results were calculated and a threshold value of coefficient was chosen to define the detection of thumb movements. The validity of detection was tested by EMG of thumb extensor. The efficacy of preprocessing algorithms was evaluated by ANOVA and chi-square tests. The results showed that, compared with the control group, both adaptive cancellation and Laplacian operation enhanced the wave suppression percentage. There is no difference between the group results of two preprocessing methods, while the individual difference is prominent. The implication of the effect of preprocessing on enhancing event detection rate is discussed.

20244362513	Quantitatively characterizing the textural features of sonographic images for breast cancer with histopathologic correlation	Objective. In this study, quantitative characterization of sonographic image texture and its correlation with histopathologic findings was developed for facilitating clinical diagnosis. A statistical feature matrix was applied to quantify the texture difference (ie, the dissimilarity) of the sonographic images for malignant and benign breast tumors. Methods. Thirty-three patients were recruited for this study. Imaging was performed on a commercially available sonographic imaging system in clinical use. The parameters used for image acquisition were kept the same during clinical examination. Results. On the basis of dissimilarity values, 3 phenomena were noted in the relatively large malignancies studied. First, stellate carcinoma showed the least dissimilarity on sonographic images; second, circumscribed carcinoma showed the most dissimilarity; and third, malignant tissue mixed with fibrous and cellular parts (dense lymphocyte infiltration and prominent intraductal tumors) had dissimilarity values in between. Image textures with smaller dissimilarity values (especially for those values <4.4 in our study) are likely to be stellate carcinoma. Conclusions. From the experimental results, it is shown that the cellular and fibrous content with spatial distribution of breast masses determine the dissimilarity values on sonographic images. The dissimilarity may be used to quantitatively represent the image texture and is well correlated with the histopathologic description. © 2005 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

0010304163	Fast registration technique of MR and SPECT brain images	In this paper, we focus on the 3D registration between the MR and SPECT brain images. It is undoubted that the human brain does not change its shape during imaging processes, registration of these two image sets can be modeled as a rigid body motion problem. Since the size of each voxel in MR and SPECT images is given, our goal is to find out three translation parameters and three rotation parameters of the motion and then match the object to a fixed position. In this paper, a hybrid method composed of homologous feature registration and surface fitting is developed. The centers of the two eyeballs are used as the feature sets for registration. Therefore, we can solve the three translation parameters and two rotation parameters. We then reslice the volume data. The remaining rotation parameter is determined by minimizing the surface distance, in the resliced 2D images. After obtaining all these parameters, the transformation matrix is determined, and the registration is well done. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

MR cholangiography involves the use of a fast maximum intensity projection algorithm for volume rendering to construct projections from different angles which can be displayed in a cine loop with adjustable speed. A gradient-based surface rendering is also utilized to display volume data. The biliary tree can be tracked and analyzed using a semi-automated 3D tracking algorithm. Although this method requires more human interaction and takes longer time, the 3D structure of the biliary tree can be visualized very clearly.

0029710028	Polygonal approximation using genetic algorithm	Polygonal approximation is an important issue in pattern recognition and image processing. A new polygonal approximation method using genetic algorithm is proposed. Genetic algorithms are search algorithms based on the mechanisms of natural selection and natural genetics. The chromosome is used to represent an approximated polygon and is represented by a binary string. Each bit, called gene, represents a curve point. A gene with value 1 indicates that the corresponding curve point is a breakpoint of the approximated polygon. The objective function is defined as the total arc-to-chord deviation between the curve and the polygon. The proposed method is compared to two existing methods proposed by Teh-Chin [5] and Ansari-Huang [6]. Some experimental results depict the superiority of the proposed approach.

0030173859	Segmentation and reconstruction of prostate from transrectal ultrasound images	In this paper, the 3D shading image of prostate is reconstructed from a series of transrectal ultrasound images. Each slice image is first smoothed by direction-based low pass filtering. The center of prostate is estimated and then a search process radiated from the estimated center is performed to locate the prostate boundary based on matched filtering. After this step, edge linking including a priori knowledge is employed to obtain a 2D contour. The Hermite-surface approach is used to interpolate the spatial data to reconstruct 3D object's surface from a series of 2D contours. The diffuse reflection and Gouraud shading are used to create the depth effect of the reconstructed 3D image. The 3D spatial structure information obtained about prostate is very contributive to physicians in the clinical diagnosis or surgical applications.

0029719964	Three-dimensional left ventricular wall motion analysis using multiplane transesophageal echocardiography	The left ventricular (LV) wall motion is the most challenging and interesting task in cardiac evaluation. In this paper, an integrated system that measures and displays left ventricular wall motion is presented. Based on the 3D reconstruction of ventricle from nine rotational cross- sectional images acquired with multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), a quantitative and visual expression of the motion of LV is presented. Nine images were obtained with the transducer rotating around a central axis passing through LV. A sequence of image processing operations have been developed for detecting left ventricular boundaries from TEE images obtained with different angle in a whole cardiac cycle. The algorithm which integrates 2D boundary information into 3D volume representation is designed based on automata theory. The phantom study for computing the scaling factors between the image metrics and the physical metrics shows a good correlation between the computed results and the specimens in the in vitro study. Finally, the 3D shape visualization of the reconstructed moving ventricle is presented. The performance of proposed experiments shows good feasibility of the new application of TEE in cardiac evaluation.

0030313572	Computer morphometry for liver fibrosis using an automatic image analysis system	Liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver diseases. The severity of fibrosis is considered the stage of chronic liver disease. However, it is evaluated by subjective description or semiquantitation. We developed an automatic image analysis system, which including a microscope, computer-driven slide-driver, and a software system for image acquisition, processing and data analysis. The automatic image analysis system deals mainly with color image segmentation. The severity of liver fibrosis is reported as the percentage of the entire fibrous area to the whole liver tissue area. Thirty-one liver needle biopsy specimens are used for this study. The results from computer morphometry were compared with that from colorimetric method and Knodell's score. Pearson correlation and Spearman rank test revealed that the Knodell's score and colorimetric method are significantly correlated with the result of computer morphometry. We found that the system is a reliable tool for evaluating the severity of liver fibrosis.

0030315823	3-D Image reconstruction of brain vessels from angiograms	This paper presents a reconstruction process to build the three-dimensional cerebral vessel tree from a pair of DSAs (digital subtraction angiograms). To segment the blood vessels from the background, the local thresholding and global thresholding was used to bilevel the input image. Thinning is applied to obtain the skeleton of the vessels. The B-Spline curve is used to smooth the skeleton. The skeleton is then tracked to find the branch points of the skeleton and used as the feature points for matching. The radius of the vessel was detected by the matched filter concept. For each feature point in the first image, we use the epipolar constraint and the property of feature points to find its correspondence on the other image. From the DSA machine structure, the data provided by the machine and the correspondence information, the least squares estimate of the real 3D skeleton position is obtained. By using the Gouraud Shading method and the radius information, we display the reconstructed 3D shading images for various viewing angles and light source directions.

0030834665	Occluded objects recognition using multiscale features and Hopfield neural network	A new method to recognize partially visible two-dimensional objects by means of multiscale features and Hopfield neural network was proposed. The Hopfield network was employed to perform global feature matching. Since the network only guarantees to converge to a local optimal state, the matching results heavily depend on the initial network state determined by the extracted features. To acquire more satisfactory initial matching results, a new feature vector was developed which consists of the multiscale evolution of the extremal position and magnitude of the wavelet transformed contour orientation. These features can even be used to discriminate dominant points, hence good initial states can be obtained. The good initiation enables our proposed method to recognize objects even heavily occluded, that cannot be achieved by using the Nasrabadi-Li's method. In addition, to make the matching results more insensitive to the threshold value selection of the network, we replace the step-like thresholding function by a ramp-like one. Experimental results have shown that our method is effective even for noisy occluded objects. Copyright © 1996 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

0031684291	Liver volume in patients with or without chronic liver diseases	BAGKGROUND/AIMS: The size of the liver is an important clinical parameter; the aim of this study is to examine the correlation between liver volume and etiology and the severity of disease, and to evaluate its usefulness in predicting survival. METHODOLOGY: Patients observed in this study were comprised of thirty three patients with non-liver disease and 44 patients with chronic liver disease (alcoholic hepatitis, 9; hepatitis B, 24; and hepatitis C, 11). The liver volume was measured from digitized CT scan images. Techniques of planimetry and summation of areas were utilized for calculation. RESULTS: The prediction model to estimate liver volume in patients without liver disease was: liver volume (ml) = 113 x height (cm)] + [12 x weight (Kg)] - 1530. The volume ratio (%) [(volume from reconstructed image/predicted volume) x 100] of alcoholic patients was 135.9 ± 25.8, which was significantly higher than that of chronic hepatitis B (73.6 ± 15.4) and chronic hepatitis C (74.5 ± 20.7). Patients with chronic viral hepatitis were classified into Child-Pugh class A (N = 10), B (N = 14) and C (N = 11). Analysis of variance and trend test revealed that the volume ratio had a significant decreasing trend from the control group (100.5 ± 8.1), class A (83.4 ± 13.9), class B (72.2 ± 13.2) to class C (63.3 ± 14.4). CONCLUSIONS: Liver volume can be predicted from patients' weight and height if they have no liver disease. The liver volume ratio correlates much better with etiology and severity of the disease and is a reliable predictor for patient's survival.

0031106292	Edge-shrinking interpolation for medical images	A new algorithm for interpolating the missing data between two adjacent medical images is presented. Our method is useful for solving the interpolation of any region-represented images of an object to be reconstructed, even when the object is stretched abruptly, branched or hollow, as often occurs in medical images, which cases can not be handled well by existing methods. When this algorithm is applied, the nonoverlapped regions of the same object in the two base images are first extracted and encoded by chamfer distance code on every pixel in these regions. Then, the outer edges of the nonoverlapping regions are shrunk inward simultaneously so that the stretched edges reach the edges of the overlapping regions at the same time. The distance codes in nonoverlapping regions are used to limit the shrinking of these edges in the interpolation process. The proposed method also provides object centralization and enlargement operations to obtain stable and reasonable results in complicated case. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective and efficient in resolving general interpolation tasks than the existing methods.

0031735373	Expression of fibroblast growth factor-1 and fibroblast growth factor-2 in normal liver and hepatocellular carcinoma	This study was performed to examine the immunohistochemical expression of fibroblast growth factor-1 and fibroblast growth factor-2 in normal liver and a total of 31 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Reactivity for both types of angiogenic factor did not exist in any cellular component of normal liver. For HCC, variable amounts of fibroblast growth factor-1 were detected in 6 of 31 cases (19.4%). There was no apparent relationship between the expression pattern and clinicopathologic factors (P > 0.1, respectively), except a positive correlation with histologic grading (P = 0.04). No tumor showed reactivity for fibroblast growth factor-2 in their cancer cells. However, both types of peptide could be demonstrated in the pericellular stroma of HCC. With a mean follow-up at 60 months, fibroblast growth factor, 1 expression did not correlate with patients' outcome (P > 0.1). Our study suggested that fibroblast growth factor-1 appears to play a certain role in hepatocarcinogenesis.

0031126812	Multiresolution registration of coronary artery image sequences	Registration of coronary arterial images taken at different times is very important for obtaining better visibility of differences between sequential images. A typical image registration algorithm often employs a similarity measure to detect the differences generated from the relative motion or gray level changes between these images. Although a number of image registration approaches have been proposed to resolve the registration problem of digital angiography, they are either computationally expensive or not very robust in the application to practical images. This paper presents a feature-based sum of absolute values of difference (SAVD) using a coarse-to-fine strategy. The proposed algorithm was demonstrated to be capable of automatically registering the arterial structures in the areas of interest selected from a pair of sequential images as well as providing fractional pixel precision in registration. Compared to other existing methods, the algorithm improves the speed and the reliability of registration when a pair of coronary arterial images are acquired at the same or almost the same phase of cardiac motion.

0031882258	Computer morphometry for quantitative measurement of liver fibrosis: Comparison with Knodell's score, colorimetry and conventional description reports	Liver fibrosis is currently described quite subjectively or, at best, semiquantitatively by scoring systems. In order to measure the severity of liver fibrosis quantitatively and to compare this with established methods, such as Knodell's scoring system, the colorimetric method and conventional description reports, we undertook the present study. A personal computer with an image grabber card and a microscope equipped with a computer-controlled slide-driver was used for computer morphometry. The principle behind morphometry is based on the different colours of hepatocytes and fibres following staining with Masson's trichrome stain. There were 31 patients (25 male, six female) recruited into the present study with a mean ± SD age of 41.6 ± 15 years (range 24-66 years). Of these patients, 16 had chronic hepatitis B, 12 had chronic hepatitis C and three were alcoholics. Colorimetric methods and Knodell's fibrosis score were performed according to established protocols. Conventional description reports were obtained from reviews of patient charts. The results from computer morphometry were highly correlated with results from the colorimetric method, with a correlation coefficiency γ = 0.85 (P < 0.0001). The results from computer morphometry also correlated with both Knodell's scoring system (γ = 0.69; P<0.001) and conventional description reports (γ = 0.46; P < 0.01). Results from Knodell's scoring system were significantly correlated with computer morphometry, as follows: score 0, 2.7 ± 1.4; score 1, 5.7 ± 1.2; score 2, 7.7 ± 2.3; score 3, 10.7 ± 3.2; score 4, 21.8 ± 14.1. The trend was statistically significant by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. In conclusion, our computerized morphometry system is a reliable tool for the evaluation of the severity of liver fibrosis and can be used as a tool for the objective quantification of liver fibrosis.

0032002752	A new multiscale-based shape recognition method	A new method to recognize objects by means of multiscale features and Hopfield neural networks is proposed in this paper. The feature vector consists of the multiscale wavelet transformed extremal evolution. The evolution contains the information of the contour primitives in a multiscale manner, which can be used to discriminate dominant points, hence a good initial state of the Hopfield network can be obtained. Such good initiation enables the network to converge more efficiently. A new normalization scheme, wavelet normalization, was developed to make our method scale invariant and to reduce the distortion resulting from normalizing the object contours. The Hopfield neural network was employed as a global processing mechanism for feature matching. The Hopfield network was modified to guarantee unique and more stable matching results. A new matching evaluation scheme, which is computationally efficient, was proposed to evaluate the goodness of matching. Images of industrial tools were used to test the performance of the proposed method under noisy, occluded and affine conditions. Experimental results have shown that our method is robust and more efficient than the Mokhtarian-Mackworth's method. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

0032401454	New rendering method: Scan-line based semi-boundary algorithm	A graphics-based simulation has been proved as a powerful tool in surgical and therapeutic applications. In a computer aided surgical simulation system, it must provide real-time rendering performance as well as flexible 3D object manipulation. In this paper, we propose a new volume rendering scheme, namely SSB (Scan-line Based Semi-Boundary). The time complexity of SSB is O (MN) plus a 2-Dimensional image rotation, and the SSB is theoretically faster than the original Semi-Boundary algorithm that will take O(LMN) time, where L,M,N are the Semi-Boundary nodes in X, Y, Z axes, respectively. We experimentally evaluate SSB rendering performance using large pelvis volume data. Our preliminary results show that SSB can achieve an interactive rendering performance for large volume pelvis data set with size of 512×512×245.

0032439750	Three-dimensional measurement of liver volume by the rotation method: In vitro study	Background: The multiplane transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) probe provides a stable position that allows rotation around a central axis to record high-resolution cross-sectional images. The purpose of this study was to use this probe to evaluate the accuracy of a three-dimensional (3-D) volume-calculating algorithm developed in our laboratory to quantify phantom volumes. Method: Ten irregular-shaped phantom specimens were assessed. Cross- sectional images (range of rotation, 0°-160°) were obtained using 20°rotational sections with a multiplane TEE probe. The images were digitized and reconstructed, and the volumes computed. These computed volumes were compared with actual volumes, measured using a volumetric bottle, by linear regression analysis. The interobserver reproducibility was also evaluated. Results: In this experiment, the measured volumes of the phantom specimens ranged from 21 to 118 ml. The computed volumes correlated well with the actual volumes (r = 0.97). The mean error in calculating volume was only 4.3 ml. An excellent correlation for the interobserver reproducibility was also noted (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The 3-D algorithm we developed enabled us to accurately calculate the volumes of irregularly shaped specimens. Further studies using animal hearts are needed to validate the use of this algorithm for cardiac volume measurement.

0032585842	Interactive 3-D virtual colonoscopy system	We describe a low-cost three-dimensional (3-D) virtual colonoscopy system that is a noninvasive technique for examining the entire colon and can assist physicians in detecting polyps inside the colon. Using the helical CT data and proposed techniques, we can three-dimensionally reconstruct and visualize the inner surface of the colon. We generate high resolution of video views of the colon interior structures as if the viewer's eyes were inside the colon. The physicians can virtually navigate inside the colon in two different modes: interactive and automatic navigation, respectively. For automatic navigation, the flythrough path is determined a priori using the 3-D thinning and two-pass tracking schemes. The whole colon is spatially subdivided into several cells, and only potentially visible cells are taken into account during rendering. To further improve rendering efficiency, potentially visible cells are rendered at different levels of detail. Additionally, a chain of bounding volume in each cell is used to avoid penetrating through the colon during navigation. In comparison with previous work, the proposed system can efficiently accomplish required preprocessing tasks and afford adequate rendering speeds on a low-cost PC system.

0032593844	Identification of vessel contours from three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiograms	Three-dimensional MR angiogram offers a means for visualizing the entire cerebral vessels from any orientation and for detecting the stenotic lesions. In this paper we proposed a new 3-D tracking method for reconstructing cerebral vessels from MR angiograms. Then, based on the image analysis and visualization results of the vessel trees, various important information can be computed. In vessel extraction, an urchin tracking technique is proposed to extract each segment of the vessel trees. The behaviors of the urchin including pinpricks growing, moving, and sub-urchin generation are designed and implement. Our scheme is also capable of handling the problem of the vessel bifurcation. In vessel display, semi-boundary technique was employed. The system performed in the vessel extraction takes roughly 15 seconds on a PC Pentium 166 for a 256×256×60 8-bits 3-D angiogram. Compared with conventional methods, we proposed a fast and stable method to obtain the 3-D vessel trees.

0032594044	3D image display of fetal ultrasonic image by thin shell	Due to the properties of convenience and non-invasion, ultrasound has become an essential tool for diagnosis of fetal abnormality during women pregnancy in obstetrics. However, the `noisy and blurry' nature of ultrasound data makes the rendering of the data a challenge in comparison with MRI and CT images, in spite of the speckle noise, the unwanted objects usually occlude the target to be observed. In this paper, we proposed a new system that can effectively depress the speckle noise, extract the target object, and clearly render the 3D fetal image in almost real-time from 3D ultrasound image data. The system is based on a deformable model that detects contours of the object according to the local image feature of ultrasound. Besides, in order to accelerate rendering speed, a thin shell is defined to separate the observed organ from unrelated structures depending on those detected contours. In this way, we can support quick 3D display of ultrasound, and the efficient visualization of 3D fetal ultrasound thus becomes possible.

Due to large medical data, huge computations are necessary on 3D visualisation, especially for a real-time system. Many existing methods are sequential, which are too slow to be practical in real applications. In our previous work, we showed boundary detection and feature points extraction by using Hopfield networks. In this paper, a new feature points matching method for 3D surfaces using a Hopfield neural network is proposed. Taking advantage of parallel and energy convergence capabilities in the Hopfield networks, this method is faster and more stable for feature points matching. Stereoscopic visualisation is the display result of our system. With stereoscopic visualisation, the 3D liver used in the experiment can leap out of the screen in true 3D stereoscopic depth.

23844513945	Three-dimensional registration and analysis for brain SPECT images	Tc-99m HMPAO is a typical tracer used in the analysis of cerebral blood flow. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging utilizing Tc-99m HMPAO is thus a popular method to assess brain function. An image analysis system for SPECT images that performs a series of image processing procedures including three-dimensional (3-D) image registration, brain extraction, and intensity normalization, is presented here to map all the 3-D brain data to the same space. Afterward, the aligned images undertake a standard statistical analysis, the paired t test, to detect the areas that have significant deviations between the two sets of images. The statistical t map is then represented with a color plot for each brain slice to indicate the activation foci. The registration results are evaluated on the designed phantom images, the acquired clinical images, and by visual inspection. The experimental studies reveal that the subvoxel accuracy is achieved and the consistency is also maintained. Besides, the resulting statistic maps are found very helpful to doctors for lesion evaluation and localization in the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenic patients. © 2004 IEEE.

30444448677	The representations of sonographic image texture for breast cancer using co-occurrence matrix	In this paper, the feature parameters derived from the co-occurrence matrix are applied to quantitatively characterize the texture features of the ultrasound images for breast cancer diagnosis. Further correlation with the histopathological finding is also developed for facilitating clinical diagnosis. Thirty-three patients are recruited for this study. The ultrasound imaging system in clinical use is ATL HDI 3000. The parameters used for image acquisition are kept in the same conditions during clinical examination. The image characteristics of various texture features are demonstrated with examples of various breast nodules. The associated parameters for texture features of the nodules can be summarized as follows: 1. Energy: homogenous texture; 2. Entropy: disorder of the image; 3. Sum average: homogeneously brightness; 4. Contrast: difference of gray-scale through continuous pixels of the image; 5. Variance: heterogeneity; 6. Inverse differential moment (IDM): local homogeneity; and 7. Correlation: linear relationship between the gray-scale of pixel pairs. From the results, it is shown that the breast nodule revealing high energy, high IDM value, low contrast, low variance, low entropy, or low sum average value in its sonographic image suggest the case of breast cancer with the pattern of delicate fibrous stroma and multiple small tumorous foci in pathological findings.

3042635172	Automatic extraction and visualization of human inner structures from endoscopic image sequences	Most of the three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of human organs rely on medical volume data. In this paper, we propose to use the endoscopic image sequences as a new image modality for surface reconstruction of human organs or tissues. Using the pinhole camera model, the original 3-D points are projected to two-dimensional (2-D) images by multiplying transformation matrices. We assume the intrinsic camera parameters, such as the focal length and principal points, are known and simplify the transformation matrices to only include the camera motion, i.e. camera rotation and translation. Using the factorization method for recovering the shape of the object and the motion of the camera from an image sequence, the 3-D structures are computed. 3-D reconstruction from endoscopie image sequences is a new exploration. It provides additional information that facilitates the understanding for the lesion areas three-dimensionally. And the reconstructed structures directly correspond to the original images and can be rendered with precise texture-mapping easily. It has potential to be used to guide surgery and serve as an alternative data source for constructing new stereo endoscopy systems using one camera.

This method consists of three steps: boundary detection, shape analysis and 3-D registration. The boundary detection of the organs was achieved by analyzing texture and intensity variation from SPECT and ultrasound images. A binary shape analysis technique was designed to detect lesion areas. Subsequently, we utilized surface fitting over the boundaries with fast initial pose estimation to integrate images from two different modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully visualized the functional distribution onto anatomical structure of kidney and assisting physicians to accurately locate the lesion of acute pyelonephritis.

It is an important but difficult issue in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a new method based on Laws' microtexture energies and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to construct a probabilistic deformable model for kidney segmentation. First, using texture image features and MAP estimation, we classify each image pixel as inside or outside the boundary. Then, we design a deformable model to locate the actual boundary and maintain the smooth nature of the organ. Using gradient information subject to a smoothness constraint, the optimal contour is obtained by the dynamic programming technique. Experiments on different datasets are described. We find this method to be an effective approach. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To reduce the speckle noise, compounding techniques have been widely applied to improve image quality through signal averaging. In this paper, a 2-D ultrasonic motion compounding system is proposed that uses a hierarchical adaptive feature weighted motion estimation method to realign the frames before compounding. Each frame is first registered to the reference frame and then compounded to reduce the speckle noises. Several compounding strategies are then used to remove the unwanted degradation. Performance has been tested on both synthetic and in vivo clinical ultrasonic images. The experimental results show that the motion can be assessed accurately and the compounded images achieve good signal-to-noise ratio for improving the quality of ultrasonic images. © 2005 IEEE.

33947579930	Ultrasound motion estimation using a hierarchical feature weighting algorithm	The quality of ultrasonic images is usually influenced by speckle noises and the temporal decorrelation of the speckle patterns. Most traditional motion estimation algorithms are not suitable for speckle tracking in medical ultrasonic images which usually have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper proposes a new motion estimation algorithm that is designed for assessing the dense velocity fields of soft tissue motion in a sequence of ultrasonic B-mode images. We design a hierarchical maximum a posteriori estimator together with an adaptive feature weighted mechanism to estimate the motion field from an ultrasonic image sequence. The proposed method was compared with several existing motion estimation methods via a series of experiments with synthetic speckle image sequences. Performance was also tested on in vivo ultrasonic images. The experimental results show that motion can be assessed with better accuracy than other methods for synthetic speckle images and a good correspondence with clinicians' observations has also been achieved for clinical ultrasonic images. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

34047123204	Nerve cell segmentation via multi-scale gradient watershed hierarchies	Automated segmentation of nerve cell in microscopic image is an important task in neural researches. We proposed a multi-scale watershed-based approach to cope with this microscopic image analysis problem. There are three stages in the proposed segmentation algorithm: (1) a multi-scale watershed scheme is used to estimate an initial location of nerve cell nuclei; (2) we can identity nerve cell nuclei according to properties of nerve cell and watershed results in different scale; (3) Once the possible nerve cell is identified as a true one, a fuzzy rule based Active Contour Model (ACM) is applied to find the optimal outer contour. Our approach can segment nerve cell automatically and accurately. The cell detection rates in the experiments are above 95%. Moreover, the fuzzy rule based ACM provides flexible alternative to handle cell contour detection. © 2006 IEEE.

34250760764	Three-dimensional modeling from endoscopic video using geometric constraints via feature positioning	The endoscope is a popular imaging modality used in many preevaluations and surgical treatments, and is also one of the essential tools in minimally invasive surgery. However, regular endoscopes provide only 2-D images. Even though stereoendoscopy systems can display 3-D images, the real anatomical structure of the observed lesion is unavailable and can only be judged by the surgeon's imagination. In this paper, we present a constraint-based factorization method for reconstructing 3-D structures registered to the patient, from 2-D endoscopic images. The proposed method incorporates the geometric constraints from the tracked surgical instrument into the traditional factorization method based on frame-to-frame feature motion on the endoscopically viewed scene. Experiments with real and synthetic data demonstrate good real-scale 3-D extraction, with greater accuracy than is available from traditional methods. The reconstruction process can also be accomplished in a few seconds, making it suitable for on-line surgical applications to provide surgeons with additional 3-D shape information, critical distance monitoring and warnings. © 2007 IEEE.

38049103823	Dual snake-based vessel wall detection for MSCT coronary artery analysis	This paper presents a novel methodology for precise detection of both sides of the arterial walls (lumen border and vessel border) in multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography for coronary artery disease analysis. First, a 3D region growing strategy with a volume limitation quickly determines the center of the coronary artery for the region of interest. The vessel centers are then aggregated to form the central curve of the vessel. For each of the points along the central curve, the volumetric data is processed to generate a target image slice (TISL) which is perpendicular to the curve at that point. Because of the optimal orientation, the TISL image yields good dimensions for the vessel at that point. Organizing the TISL images linearly as a target image stack (TIST) forms a straightened longitudinal version of the vessel, and the TIST longitudinal cross-section produces a good anatomic structure relation image. Secondly, a proposed dual snake model is then used to simultaneously detect the inner and outer vessel wall borders for each TISL. The automatic initialization of the deformable model is achieved by integrating detected vessel boundaries on four TIST longitudinal images based on a minimum cost path method. For validation, vessel diameter and area determined automatically by the proposed method were compared with those defined manually by experts and by corresponding conventional angiography (r = 0.9160 ∼ 0.9740, p < 0.0001). The proposed method achieved sub-pixel accuracy. The entire process is computationally fast and simple. The proposed system (methodology) could provide a fast and reliable clinical tool for physicians in the diagnosis and treatment planning of coronary diseases.

In the method, a chromosome is used to represent a polygon and is represented by a binary string. Each bit, called a gene, represents a point on the object curve. The objective function is defined as the integral square error between the given curve and the approximated polygon. Three genetic operators namely selection, crossover and mutation, have been constructed for this specific problem.

0033328740	Motion segmentation and estimation of active skeletal muscles in ultrasonic image sequences	The segmentation of high contrast anatomical structure from different medical images has been widely explored. However, there are seldom algorithms available to reliably segment soft tissue structures of a moving musculoskeletal system with ambiguous boundaries from ultrasound image sequences. Often, ambiguous object boundaries in a single image frame can be easily resolved when dynamic effects are computed based on a sequence of frames. But, the contraction of active skeletal muscles is very complex, such as concentric contraction, isometric contraction and eccentric contraction. These inhomogeneous motion properties make them very difficult to segment. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm to segment the active skeletal muscles by minimizing an energy function and the curve motion estimation.

0033330783	Adaptive diffusion filter and absorbing light function for effective preprocessing in fetal ultrasound	The `noisy and blurry' nature of ultrasound data makes the rendering of the data a challenge in comparison with the handle of MRI and CT images. In this paper, we explore the techniques of preprocessing 3D fetal ultrasound data. An adaptive modified diffusion filter (AMDF) with local information of the image data is designed in smoothing the noisy sonogram. To remove the large noise that occludes the desired object and can not be depressed by diffusion filtering, we propose an effective new method, called absorbing light function, to take away the occluding area interactively. These two functions are particularly useful in reducing speckle noise and removing area obstacles on 3D fetal sonogram. Thus the quality of subsequent visualization is significantly elevated.

0033335224	Knowledge guided left ventricular segmentation - the Taguchi approach	The deformable model (snake) is widely applied in segmentation for medical images especially for cardiac image analysis. Although the model is flexible in the contour deformation process, the weights of associated energy in the model are always given empirically. The systematic (or automatic) weight assignment is still unavailable. In this paper, we propose a new method to determine the weights of snake properly for the detection of left ventricle from sonogram. The Taguchi method is adopted to obtain the weight assignment efficiently. To avoid the type one error in weight assignment, the ANOVA test is performed to verify the correctness of our assumption. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully resolves the weight assignment problem in the deformable model and obtains satisfactory cardiac contour detection.

0032862375	Interactive voxel surface rendering in medical applications	Semi-boundary (SB) data structure is a compact voxel surface representation of the structure from the medical images. It represents only the boundary of the extracted structure and only an opaque object boundary involved in a 3D dataset can be visualized. Its computational complexity is in proportion to the number of SB voxels. In this paper, we propose schemes to reduce the number of projections in two ways. First, in conjunction with neighboring code, we exploit a set of visibility tables to cull some of the invisible SB voxels. Second, we exploit three pass rotations and an incremental approach to quickly determine the projection position for each SB voxel during rendering. With these two combinations, we significantly improve SB rendering performance. As a result, we can achieve the interactive rendering speed on general purpose workstations for our medical applications.

0032903618	Liver, spleen and tumor volume measured by personal computer	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Computed tomography (CT) scans are common examinations for patients with chronic liver diseases. To quantitate the organ or tumor volume from the scans and to accomplish the task in an efficient way with the most economic equipment, we developed a system based on a personal computer. METHODOLOGY: We used color-markers and transparency to sketch the edges of liver, hepatoma, and spleen. Each organ or tumor of interest is marked out by fine-point markers on pieces of transparency. The sketch was scanned into a digitized image format on a personal computer (Pentium 133). The calculation involves edge detection, three-dimensional reconstruction, and voxel counting. By using summation-of-the-area and trapezoid approximation technique, the voxels of each structure are counted. In this study, we illustrate the potential application in the management of a hepatic cancer patient. RESULTS: After digitalization, the data size of CT images is about 1 to 1.5 megabytes. It takes less than 5 min to complete volume calculation. CONCLUSIONS: By this method, tumor load before and after chemotherapy can be estimated easily and accurately. This would be helpful in clinical practice.

0033682947	A new approach to ultrasonic liver image classification	In this paper, we have proposed a new method for diffuse liver disease classification with sonogram, including the normal liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis, from a new point of view "scale." The new system utilizes a multiscale analysis tool, called wavelet transforms, to analyze the ultrasonic liver images. A new set of features consisting of second order statistics derived from the wavelet transformed images is employed. From these features, we have found that the third scale is the representative scale for the classification of the considered liver diseases, and the horizontal wavelet transform can improve the representation of the corresponding features. Experimental results show that our method can achieve about 88% correct classification rate which is superior to other measures such as the co-occurrence matrices [1], the Fourier power spectrum [2], and the texture spectrum [3]-[5]. This implies that our feature set can access the granularity from sonogram more effectively. It should be pointed out that our features are powerful for discriminating the normal livers from the cirrhosis because there is no misclassification samples between the normal liver and the cirrhosis sets. In addition, the experimental results also verify the usefulness of "scale" because our multiscale feature set can gain eighteen percent advantage over the direct use of the statistical features. This means that the wavelet transform at proper scales can effectively increase the distances among the statistical feature clusters of different liver diseases.

0033745212	Visualization of human cerebral cortex by flattening algorithms	Visualization of human brain function based on cortical activity is an interesting research work. Since most of the cerebral cortical surface areas are buried inside folds, the complex topology of cortical surface makes the visualization extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new visualization system involving reconstructing 3-D cortical surfaces, rendering and flattening the resulting surface. Besides developing the conventional polygon-based flattening algorithm, we also propose a new voxel-based flattening method that flattens the cortical surface directly from the 3-D voxel data. For a polygon-based method, the cerebral cortical surfaces have to be firstly transferred to 3-D polygons and then mapped onto a minimally distorted 2-D plane, which is achieved by an optimization procedure. However, the proposed new method converts the 3-D cortical voxel data directly to a 2-D map. The flattened map is then obtained from warping this 2-D map to the position of minimum distortions. We demonstrate the utility of two approaches by the entirely and partially flattened cerebral cortex map in MRI images. These approaches will facilitate more refined analysis in the function of cerebral cortex.

Three genetic operators, including selection, crossover, and mutation, are designed to obtain the approximated polygon whose error is bounded by a given norm. Many experiments show that the convergence is guaranteed and the optimal or near-optimal solutions can be obtained. Compared with the Zhu-Seneviratne algorithm, the proposed algorithm successfully reduced the number of segments under the same error condition in the polygonal approximation.

0033980505	Novel image analysis of corpus cavernous tissue in impotent men	Objectives. To objectively evaluate the contents of corpus cavernous tissue in impotent men using an automated novel image analysis system. Methods. Thirty-three impotent men and 2 normal potent men (controls) underwent corpus cavernous biopsies. The procedures were performed using a Biopty gun under local anesthesia. The obtained specimens were stained with Masson's trichome technique, and the collagen fiber contents were evaluated by a computerized morphometric analysis method. In addition, we estimated the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of this automated image analysis system. Results. No major complication was noted during or after the biopsies. Of the 33 impotent patients, 3 were diagnosed as having psychogenic, 11 as having arteriogenic, 13 as having venogenic, 1 as having neurogenic, and 5 as having idiopathic impotence. The collagen fiber percentages in the 35 men were as follows: normal potent: 48.2% ± 1.4%, psychogenic 55.2% ± 11.6%, arteriogenic 73.2% ± 4.4%, venogenic 66.5% ± 4.2%, neurogenic 76.9%, and idiopathic 77.4% ± 4.2%. Significant differences were found between the normal potent and arteriogenic groups (P < 0.05) and between the normal potent and idiopathic groups (P < 0.05). Patients older than 60 years had a higher collagen fiber content (70.4% ± 3.7%) than those younger than 50 years old (58.6% ± 5.2%). The interobserver and intraobserver variances were both negligible for this automated image analysis system. This method significantly reduced the amount of variation introduced by the intra-rater reliability of a technician compared with the manual method. Conclusions. The present automated image analysis system is believed to be a reliable, accurate quantitative measurement tool for studies of penile tissue. Cavernous biopsy is a rapid, safe, and representative modality to study penile disease. An increase in cavernous collagen fibers (or corporal fibrosis) is considered an important factor in impaired erectile function. (C) 2000, Elsevier Science Inc.

39649105433	Quantitative correlation between sonographic textural feature and histopathological components for breast cancer: preliminary results	In this study, the sonographic texture and the histopathological features of breast cancer were objectively characterized. Textural dissimilarity is demonstrated to correlate well with the corresponding histopathological components. The normalized percentage of both fibrosis area and cellular area has highly linear correlation with the textural feature of dissimilarity. The correlation coefficients are -.880 and .857, respectively. The cancerous region with increased fibrous tissues shows low textural dissimilarity and has a strong tendency of negative correlation, whereas the cancerous region with increased cellularity exhibits high textural dissimilarity and a good positive correlation. These results have not been reported so far, and they can be used to predict cellular and fibrotic portions of breast cancer for biopsy or surgery planning, disease progression monitoring, and therapeutic effect evaluation. The proposed image analysis method may also be extended to similar characterization of cancerous tissue in other applications. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34247508089	Wavelet-based fractal features with active segment selection: Application to single-trial EEG data	Feature extraction in brain-computer interface (BCI) work is one of the most important issues that significantly affect the success of brain signal classification. A new electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system utilizing active segment selection and multiresolution fractal features is designed and tested for single-trial EEG classification. Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the proposed system consists of three main procedures including active segment selection, feature extraction, and classification. The active segment selection is based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, and is used to obtain the optimal active time segment in the time-frequency domain. We then utilize a modified fractal dimension to extract multiresolution fractal feature vectors from the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) data for movement classification. By using a simple linear classifier, we find significant improvements in the rate of correct classification over the conventional approaches in all of our single-trial experiments for real finger movement. These results can be extended to see the good adaptability of the proposed method to imaginary movement data acquired from the public databases. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

40849104749	Model-based reconstruction of featureless objects for automated storage and transportation systems	Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from images usually relies on matched point correspondences across images, and the number of detected feature points should be as great as possible to fully describe the object geometry. Featureless objects, such as heaps of raw ore that are of similar color and present very few feature points, however, can usually be seen in many industrial applications, and their 3D reconstruction is essential to developing automated storage and transportation systems. Therefore, we propose a model-based method that utilizes a generic model with an additional reference point to estimate the 3D structure of a featureless object which is the ore pile in our cases. The size, position, and orientation of the estimated object are then optimized, followed by redundant area removal to fit the finer details. We also extend the method to the reconstruction of multiple objects. Experimental results show that the method successfully reconstructs featureless objects having similar colors and textures. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

0034859140	Facial surgery simulation using finite element modeling	We design a three-dimensional facial surgical simulation system, which predicts the patient's post-surgical appearance from his CT volume data. The general steps adopted in this system include data acquisition, image preprocessing, 3D reconstruction, simulation, and visualization. In order to predict surgical results well, we adopt finite element modeling to estimate the simulation outcome. For surgical simulation, we utilize the isopammetric hexahedron finite element model to represent the facial structure manipulated during the surgical operation. Isopammetric hexahedron element is a more flexible and accurate element type than the tetrahedron one, which was used for surgical simulation in other literatures. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to simulate facial surgery effectively.

0034859169	Photo-realistic texture mapping for voxel-based volume data	In computerized image and graphic applications, texture mapping is one of the most commonly used methods to improve the realism or to enhance the visual effect of object rendering without too much increase in computational complexity. In conventional texture mapping, a three-dimensional (3D) object has to be transferred to the polygonal structure, and then mapped with a texture or photographic image. However, it is usually computationally expensive to transfer the original data in voxels to polygons, and is even more complex to map the 2D texture image onto the 3D polygonal structure. Even though the computation is huge, the polygonal structure is not efficient in preserving the internal information of volume data. Because most volume data acquired by medical imaging devices or 3D scanners are in voxel format, it is more appropriate to handle these data directly in voxel format. In this paper, we propose a new texture mapping method based on chain-coding flattening to handle the voxel-based data directly. Therefore, the computation is reduced significantly and the internal information can be utilized and preserved thoroughly. The method flattens a 3D object surface onto a 2D plane and then uses 2D warping technique to generate the correspondences between the object surface and the texture image. Therefore, polygonal transformation required in the conventional approach is no longer necessary and texture mapping is handled with inexpensive 2D computation. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

0034315957	Three-dimensional water-flow reconstruction by stereo cameras	This paper presents a 3-D water-flow reconstruction algorithm for use on stereo-camera systems. It contains two major contributions. The first is the stereo-camera calibration method. A vanishing line is used to get a closed-form solution of the parameters of one camera and then the bicamera parameters are recursively updated for more precise results. The second contribution is the stereo matching of particles in the water flow. The difficulty here is that the correspondence of the maximum-correlation-coefficient method is not right for all water flow particles, because the illumination environment is not uniform and the aperture of the two cameras is different. We use relaxation labeling and template matching to cluster the water particles into group sets and compute the best correspondence of these sets based on epipole and camera geometry. The experimental results are reliable.

0034668334	A self-learning segmentation framework - The Taguchi approach	The detection of object boundary is an interesting and challenging task in computer vision and medical image processing. The active contour model (snake model) has attracted much attention for object boundary detection in the past decade. However, due to the lack of understanding on the effect of different energy terms to the behavior of related objective functions for an image, the assignment of weights for different energy terms in this model is usually fulfilled empirically. Few discussions have been brought out specifically for assigning these weights automatically. In this paper, a novel self-learning segmentation framework, based on the snake model is proposed and applied to the detection of cardiac boundaries from ultrasonic images. The framework consists of a learning section and a detection section, and provides a training mechanism to obtain the weights from a desired object contour given manually. This mechanism first employs Taguchi's method to determine the weight ratios among distinct energy terms, followed by a weight refinement step with a genetic algorithm. The refined weights can be treated as the a priori knowledge embedded in the manually defined contour and be used for subsequent contour detection. Experiments with both synthetic and real echocardiac images were conducted with satisfactory outcomes. Results also show that the present method can be used to analyze successive images of the same object with only one training contour. Finally, the validity of the weight determining process was verified by the analysis of variance method (ANOVA).

77954505639	Skull-based registration of intra-subject CT images: The effects of different resolutions and partial contents	The performance of a skull-based image registration is assessed for aligning intra-subject computed tomography (CT) images. Images with six levels of resolution are provided. The images with coarser resolution are resampled, followed by thresholding all images to extract the skull as the matching feature. Using the finest image as the reference, the skull-based registration is processed with sum of squared difference (SSD) criterion. In addition, images with partial contents are simulated and served as the floating image to investigate the interaction between different levels of resolution and partial contents. We conclude that a successful registration requires that more than half of the content should be preserved and the differences of image resolution between two images should be less than 16 times. © 2010 IEEE.

77954244553	New methods for registering long-time I-123 ADAM SPECT image sequences to magnetic resonance images	Background: I-123 ADAM single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) analysis is usually performed by drawing regions of interest or by directly registering the SPECT image to a magnetic resonance image (MRI). Each method is limited by an observer or registration bias. Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers were recruited for I-123 ADAM SPECT using a triple-headed gamma camera with fan-beam collimators after an intravenous injection of 185MBq of I-123 ADAM. We propose two new registration Methods: sequential registration and a two-step registration. Reconstructed images were registered to MRIs using mutual information with sequential and two-step methods. Results: The sequential and two-step method mean counts of midbrain activity were not significantly different (166.1±4.3 vs. 164.2±4.1, P=0.273), but they were significantly higher than the direct method mean count (132.8±3.7, P<0.001). Sequential and two-step method midbrain/cerebellum ratios were not significantly different (4.40±0.37 vs. 4.28±0.34, P=0.277), but they were significantly higher than the direct method midbrain/cerebellum ratio (1.68±0.16, P<0.001). Conclusion: The accuracy of the sequential method of registration was significantly better than that of drawing regions of interest or directly coregistering the SPECT image to an MRI. It is, however, tedious and time-consuming. The simplified two-step method yields similar results and is more practical for clinical I-123 ADAM SPECT studies. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84861646046	A new automatic algorithm to extract craniofacial measurements from fetal three-dimensional volumes	Objectives Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound is useful in the prenatal evaluation of fetal craniofacial structures, particularly as it provides a multiplanar view. However, an expert must designate the area of interest and the appropriate view, making measurement of fetal structures using 3D ultrasound both time-consuming and subjective. In this study we propose an image analysis system that measures automatically and precisely the fetal craniofacial structures and evaluate its performance in the second trimester of pregnancy using a new 3D volume analysis algorithm. Methods A universal facial surface template model containing the geometric shape information of a fetal craniofacial structure was constructed from a fetal phantom. Using the proposed image analysis system we fitted this stored template model using a model deformation approach to individual fetal 3D facial volumes from 11 mid-trimester fetuses, and extracted automatically the following standard measurements: biparietal diameter (BPD), occipitofrontal diameter (OFD), interorbital diameter (IOD), bilateral orbital diameter (BOD) and distance between vertex and nasion (VN). The same five parameters were measured manually by an expert and the results compared. Results Comparison of the algorithm-based automatic measurements with manual measurements made by an expert gave correlation coefficients of 0.99 for BPD, 0.98 for OFD, 0.80 for BOD, 0.83 for IOD and 0.99 for VN. There were no significant differences between automatic and manual measurements. Conclusion Our proposed system measures precisely the fetal craniofacial structures using 3D ultrasound, making it potentially useful for clinical service. This system could also be applied to other clinical fields in future testing. Copyright © 2012 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84877786866	A knowledge-based approach for carpal tunnel segmentation from magnetic resonance images	Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) has been reported as one of the most common peripheral neuropathies. Carpal tunnel segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is important for the evaluation of CTS. To date, manual segmentation, which is time-consuming and operator dependent, remains the most common approach for the analysis of the carpal tunnel structure. Therefore, we propose a new knowledge-based method for automatic segmentation of the carpal tunnel from MR images. The proposed method first requires the segmentation of the carpal tunnel from the most proximally cross-sectional image. Three anatomical features of the carpal tunnel are detected by watershed and polygonal curve fitting algorithms to automatically initialize a deformable model as close to the carpal tunnel in the given image as possible. The model subsequently deforms toward the tunnel boundary based on image intensity information, shape bending degree, and the geometry constraints of the carpal tunnel. After the deformation process, the carpal tunnel in the most proximal image is segmented and subsequently applied to a contour propagation step to extract the tunnel contours sequentially from the remaining cross-sectional images. MR volumes from 15 subjects were included in the validation experiments. Compared with the ground truth of two experts, our method showed good agreement on tunnel segmentations by an average margin of error within 1 mm and dice similarity coefficient above 0.9. © 2012 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

84887896205	Artefact-reduced kinematics measurement using a geometric finger model with mixture-prior particle filtering	It is challenging to measure the finger's kinematics of underlying bones in vivo. This paper presents a new method of finger kinematics measurement, using a geometric finger model and several markers deliberately stuck on skin surface. Using a multiple-view camera system, the optimal motion parameters of finger model were estimated using the proposed mixture-prior particle filtering. This prior, consisting of model and marker information, avoids generating improper particles for achieving near real-time performance. This method was validated using a planar fluoroscopy system that worked simultaneously with photographic system. Ten male subjects with asymptomatic hands were investigated in experiments. The results showed that the kinematic parameters could be estimated more accurately by the proposed method than by using only markers. There was 20-40% reduction in skin artefacts achieved for finger flexion/extension. Thus, this profile system can be developed as a tool of reliable kinematics measurement with good applicability for hand rehabilitation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

44349171307	Artifact removal and texture-based rendering for visualization of 3D fetal ultrasound images	Convenient and non-invasive ultrasonography has become an essential tool for diagnosing fetal abnormalities. However, the noisy and blurry nature of sonographic data poses a challenge. To improve object visualization, we first develop a modified diffusion filter that utilizes the local standard deviation and edge of local-average-difference to define an adaptive edge stopping function in diffusion filtering. The proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of traditional diffusion filters and shows good results in comparative experiments. Moreover, we propose a novel light absorbing function to remove large regions of interface artifacts. An advanced imaging mode, called texture-based rendering, is employed to provide more realistic rendering.

4544317199	Multiscale object recognition under affine transformation	A method to recognize planar objects undergoing affine transformation is proposed in this paper. The method is based upon wavelet multiscale features and Hopfield neural networks. The feature vector consists of the multiscale wavelet transformed extremal evolution. The evolution contains the information of the contour primitives in a multiscale manner, which can be used to discriminate dominant points, hence a good initial state of the Hopfield network can be obtained. Such good initiation enables the network to converge more efficiently. A wavelet normalization scheme was applied to make our method scale invariant and to reduce the distortion resulting from normalizing the object contours. The Hopfield neural network was employed as a global processing mechanism for feature matching and made our method suitable to recognize planar objects whose shape distortion arising from an affine transformation. The Hopfield network was improved to guarantee unique and more stable matching results. A new matching evaluation scheme, which is computationally efficient, was proposed to evaluate the goodness of matching. Two sets of images, noiseless and noisy industrial tools, undergoing affine transformation were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results showed that our method is not only effective and robust under affine transformation but also can limit the effect of noises.

46449102871	Brain MR images segmentation using statistical ratio: Mapping between watershed and competitive Hopfield clustering network algorithms	Conventional watershed segmentation methods invariably produce over-segmented images due to the presence of noise or local irregularities in the source images. In this paper, a robust medical image segmentation technique is proposed, which combines watershed segmentation and the competitive Hopfield clustering network (CHCN) algorithm to minimize undesirable over-segmentation. In the proposed method, a region merging method is presented, which is based on employing the region adjacency graph (RAG) to improve the quality of watershed segmentation. The relation of inter-region similarities is then investigated using image mapping in the watershed and CHCN images to determine more appropriate region merging. The performance of the proposed technique is presented through quantitative and qualitative validation experiments on benchmark images. Significant and promising segmentation results were achieved on brain phantom simulated data. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

50649086832	Automatic seamless mosaicing of microscopic images: Enhancing appearance with colour degradation compensation and wavelet-based blending	In order to observe the fine details of biomedical specimens, various kinds of high-magnification microscopes are used. However, they suffer from a limited field of view when visualizing highly magnified specimens. Image mosaicing techniques are necessary to integrate two or more partially overlapping images into one and make the whole specimen visible. In this study, we propose a new system that automatically creates panoramic images by mosaicing all the microscopic images acquired from a specimen. Not only does it effectively compensate for the congenital narrowness in microscopic views, but it also results in the mosaiced image containing as little distortion with respect to the originals as possible. The system consists of four main steps: (1) feature point extraction using multiscale wavelet analysis, (2) image matching based on feature points or by projection profile alignment, (3) colour difference adjustment and optical degradation compensation with a Gaussian-like model and (4) wavelet-based image blending. In addition to providing a precise alignment, the proposed system also takes into account the colour deviations and degradation in image mosaicing. The visible seam lines are eliminated after image blending. The experimental results show that the system performs well on differently stained image sequences and is effective on acquired images with large colour variations and degradation.

53049087847	Applying stochastic resonance to magnify μ and β wave suppression	The goal was to test whether band-limited sensory noises with adequate amplitudes, by the principle of stochastic resonance, could enhance μ and β wave suppressions. Scalp EEG was recorded while the subject performed thumb movements in the presence of vibratory noises applied to thenar belly or thumb tip. Seven subjects without clear μ or β wave suppression in the absence of the mechanical stimuli were recruited. The results showed that when the stimuli were applied to the thenar belly, both μ and β wave suppressions were enhanced in a bell-shaped trend (the characteristics of stochastic resonance) in four subjects. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

54049125077	Hand detections based on invariant skin-color models constructed using linear and nonlinear color spaces	Hand detections based on two proposed pixel-based skin-color models are proposed. Different from the conventional methods, the proposed models are built on the invariant surface obtained by supervised learning on nonlinear color space which effectively preserves vital properties of skin colors in low illumination. By using a high-dimensional feature space, which incorporating probability of fitting the invariant surface with a nonlinear mapping value of chrominance in linear space, first skin-color model is proposed as a thresholding method according to feature values of pixels. Subsequently, a second skincolor model is constructed based on a parametric region which maps the learning data on an invariant surface. This mode achieves more favorable skin-color segmentation results than the conventional methods in experiments. © 2008 IEEE.

57649174455	A new approach for the pelvic registration and fusion of CT and MR images	This paper presents a two-passed registration method to register the pelvic CT and MR images. The geometrical relationship between CT and Mr images is determined by some uniquely selected internal landmarks which are all located on the coxal bone. Thus, it can be assumed to be a rigid transformation. In the first passed registration, the relative feature vectors, such as the normal vectors, such as the normal vectors of acetabular rim planes and the vector connecting two centroids of rims, are extracted and used for registration. The relative feature vectors determined based on the edge of acetabular rims are one of few features which can be observed on both CT and Mr images. The registration results based on the relative feature vectors are less influenced by the variation in the accuracy of the detection of absolute feature points. In the second passed registration, the corner points of sacrum are used to eliminate the distortion in z-directions. The least square error approximation is used to obtain the transformation matrix in both registration passes. In addition, a complete system is developed to provide clinicians with all image processing operations and visualization. For the visualization of fused data, 2-D overlapping display and 3-D transparent display are used to illustrate the correspondence of different structures, including bones and soft tissues. The fused images well demonstrate the information from two complementary modalities and are highly appreciated in clinical applications.

57649183622	Motion tracking on elbow tissue from ultrasonic image sequence for patients with lateral epicondylitis	In this study, Kinesio Tape® is used in patients with lateral epicondylitis. The ultrasonic image sequences of elbow are recorded dynamically, and then motion tracking is applied to assist in understanding the effect of the therapy. Motion tracking, based on optical flow method, is used to track certain landmark on the ultrasound image, which is very ambiguous, for estimating the motion of muscle. Hierarchical block tracking technique is proposed to perform this task. The motions with and without Kinesio Taping are compared and can be used as quantitative indicators for the treatment. The experimental results show that Kinesio Taping makes the motion of muscle on the ultrasonic images enlarge. It means that the performance of muscle motion gets improve. © 2007 IEEE.

57649183856	EEG-based motor imagery analysis using weighted wavelet transform features	In this study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system for single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI) data is proposed. Feature extraction in brain-computer interface (BCI) work is an important task that significantly affects the success of brain signal classification. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied together with Student's two-sample t-statistics for 2D time-scale feature extraction, where features are extracted from EEG signals recorded from subjects performing left and right MI. First, we utilize the CWT to construct a 2D time-scale feature, which yields a highly redundant representation of EEG signals in the time-frequency domain, from which we can obtain precise localization of event-related brain desynchronization and synchronization (ERD and ERS) components. We then weight the 2D time-scale feature with Student's two-sample t-statistics, representing a time-scale plot of discriminant information between left and right MI. These important characteristics, including precise localization and significant discriminative ability, substantially enhance the classification of mental tasks. Finally, a correlation coefficient is used to classify the MI data. Due to its simplicity, it will enable the performance of our proposed method to be clearly demonstrated. Compared to a conventional 2D time-frequency feature and three well-known time-frequency approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed method provides reliable 2D time-scale features for BCI classification. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

57649193069	A color-based approach for automated segmentation in tumor tissue classification	This paper presents a new color-based approach for automated segmentation and classification of tumor tissues from microscopic images. The method comprises three stages: (1) color normalization to reduce the quality variation of tissue image within samples from individual subjects or from different subjects; (2) automatic sampling from tissue image to eliminate tedious and time-consuming steps; and (3) principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize color features in accordance with a standard set of training data. We evaluate the algorithm by comparing the performance of the proposed fully-automated method against semi-automated procedures. Experimental studies show consist agreement between the two methods. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides an effective tool for evaluating oral cancer images. It can also be applied to other microscopic images prepared with the same type of tissue staining. © 2007 IEEE.

57649203101	A comparison between the surface-based and mutual-information-based methods for co-registering SPECT and MR images	Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images are two common modalities in brain imaging society. Co-registration of brain SPECT and MR images has been used extensively in a number of clinical applications. The surface-based method and the mutual-information-based method are two major co-registration methods. The former aligns two volumetric images based on the cost function derived from brain surfaces, whereas the latter matches two volumetric images based on maximizing the mutual information (MI) between intensities of two images. To the best of our knowledge, these two methods have neither been compared, nor conjointly used to register the brain SPECT and MR images. Simulation results show that the surface-based method is more robust to the large deviation of initial guesses and computationally efficient, while the MI-based method provides better precision. The complementary features of these two methods motivated us to propose a hybrid strategy in which the surface-based method is employed to rapidly achieve a rough alignment followed by the MI-based method for fine tuning the results. Results from simulations suggested that only two iterations of MI calculation were required after surface-based registration and thereby lots of computation efforts can be saved. © 2007 IEEE.

In this study, we focused on developing a novel measurement method for kinematics of articulated finger in motion by using biomechanical model prediction and real-time video-based image analysis technique. In contrast to the marker-based system, the proposed 3D model provides more information, appearing on multiple projected 2D images, to estimate more reliable finger kinematics. The proposed method is compact, fast, and can be operated with X-ray fluoroscopy simultaneously. It means that the system provides the capability of synchronous validation between motion video and X-ray fluoroscopy. The proposed system was implemented on a personal computer and can be a new tool in diagnosis and rehabilitation for hand diseases. © 2007 IEEE.

57049138871	Using independent component analysis to detect active regions in brain fMRI for tactile stimulation	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful, non-invasive way to investigate brain activity. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI measures the decrease in deoxyhemoglobin that corresponds to the gradually increased flow of blood to the active regions of the brain. Therefore, one important task in fMRI analysis is to correctly identify the active neural regions. In this research, a new algorithm is proposed to detect brain regions engaged by tactile stimulation as measured by fMRI. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique that attempts to separate functional image data into spatially independent non-Gaussian components. The proposed ICA-based method is a two-staged process for selecting the spatially independent component that best matches with the time course of tactile stimulation. Compared to the commonly used Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) algorithms, the proposed method is more sensitive in detecting some of the active regions and requires fewer input parameters in processing the fMRI data.

This method incorporates spatial graph representation derived from the watershed segmented regions and cluster analysis information obtained from the PFHNN algorithm to achieve efficient image segmentation. The proposed scheme employs the Markov random field (MRF) model on the region adjacency graph (RAG) to improve the quality of watershed segmentation. Here, the fusion criterion is according to the correlation coefficient, which uses inter-region similarities to determine the merging of regions. Analysis of the performance of the proposed technique is presented through quantitative and qualitative validation experiments on benchmark images, and significant and promising segmentation results are presented using brain phantom simulated data. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

In morphometric brain imaging studies, BD subjects have atrophic gray matter, especially in the prefrontal area. These structural abnormalities could involve the change of cortical shape. Gyrification index (GI) is a useful metric to measure the degree of cortical complexity. This work aims to compare the cortical development between bipolar patients and healthy controls using GI. No significant difference was detected between two groups. However, we found asymmetry pattern of cortical complexity was increased in limbic lobe on bipolar patients.

67650786774	Live cell tracking based on cellular state recognition from microscopic images	The analysis of cell motion is an essential process in fundamental medical studies because most active cellular functions involve motion. In this paper, a computer-assisted motion analysis system is proposed for cell tracking. In the proposed tracking process, unlike in conventional tracking methods, cellular states referring to the cellular life cycle are defined and appropriate strategies are adopted for cells at different states. The use of cellular state recognition allows detection of possible cell division and hence can improve the robustness of cell tracking. Experimental results show that cells can be successfully segmented and tracked over a long period of time, and the proposed system is found to be as accurate as manual tracking. Various quantitative analyses and visualizations are used to represent cell motion, which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed system in the study of cell dynamics. © 2009 The Royal Microscopical Society.

68949196055	Functional workspace for precision manipulation between thumb and fingers in normal hands	Prehensile functions of hand are based on thumb-finger relationships which are regarded as an essential element in various manipulations of our daily living activities. Although the maximal workspace provides clinicians a way to comprehend the ranges of digital movements, little is known about the "functional workspace" based on thumb-finger relationships. This study defines the functional workspace of the precision thumb-finger grasp as the range of all possible positions in which thumb-tip and each fingertip can simultaneously contact each other. We present a quantitative method for measuring the functional workspace of the human hand. The maximal motion trajectories of thumb-tip and fingertips of twenty subjects were recorded using a video-capture system. The functional workspace of the precision manipulation was calculated via numerical methods based on the maximal workspaces obtained of the thumb-tip and fingertip motions. The ratios of the functional workspace with respect to the maximal workspace of the index, middle, ring and little fingers were calculated as 33.7%, 27.1%, 23.5% and 19.1%, respectively. Although the present approach is still a descriptive work which might require more validations or evidences to justify, the results obtained may become normal standards for practical use in objective handicapped authentications, insurance claims, and rehabilitation programs as well as criteria for ergonomic design considerations in the near future. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It deals with the common problems of low contrast and uneven illumination that afflict endoscopic imaging. In particular, irregular feature trajectories are eliminated to improve quality. The structure of soft tissue is determined by an iterative factorization method based on collection of tracked features. A shape updating mechanism is proposed in order to yield scale-invariant structures. Experimental results show that the tracking method produced good tracking performance and increased the number of tracked feature trajectories. The real scale and structure of the target scene was successfully estimated, and the recovered structure is more accuracy than the conventional method.

70350571729	Model analyses of visual biofeedback training for EEG-based brain-computer interface	The primary goal of this study was to construct a simulation model of a biofeedback brain-computer interface (BCI) system to analyze the effect of biofeedback training on BCI users. A mathematical model of a man-machine visual-biofeedback BCI system was constructed to simulate a subject using a BCI system to control cursor movements. The model consisted of a visual tracking system, a thalamo-cortical model for EEG generation, and a BCI system. The BCI system in the model was realized for real experiments of visual biofeedback training. Ten sessions of visual biofeedback training were performed in eight normal subjects during a 3-week period. The task was to move a cursor horizontally across a screen, or to hold it at the screen's center. Experimental conditions and EEG data obtained from real experiments were then simulated with the model. Three model parameters, representing the adaptation rate of gain in the visual tracking system and the relative synaptic strength between the thalamic reticular and thalamo-cortical cells in the Rolandic areas, were estimated by optimization techniques so that the performance of the model best fitted the experimental results. The serial changes of these parameters over the ten sessions, reflecting the effects of biofeedback training, were analyzed. The model simulation could reproduce results similar to the experimental data. The group mean success rate and information transfer rate improved significantly after training (56.6 to 81.1% and 0.19 to 0.76 bits/trial, respectively). All three model parameters displayed similar and statistically significant increasing trends with time. Extensive simulation with systematic changes of these parameters also demonstrated that assigning larger values to the parameters improved the BCI performance. We constructed a model of a biofeedback BCI system that could simulate experimental data and the effect of training. The simulation results implied that the improvement was achieved through a quicker adaptation rate in visual tracking gain and a larger synaptic gain from the visual tracking system to the thalamic reticular cells. In addition to the purpose of this study, the constructed biofeedback BCI model can also be used both to investigate the effects of different biofeedback paradigms and to test, estimate, or predict the performances of other newly developed BCI signal processing algorithms. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

0035311732	Boundary based parametric polygon morphing	A simple and an efficient algorithm for polygon morphing is proposed in this paper. We adopt the parametric curve representation based on Fourier parameter estimation to transfer the traditional morphing process in spatial domain to a process in the parametric space instead. The principles are to express the polygon as the union of matching segments that are described by the estimated Fourier parameters. We have also designed a data resampling method that effectively controls the shape morphing according to the corresponding curvature values. Intermediate objects in-between the source and target polygons are then constructed based on the interpolation of Fourier parameters of the two polygons. Fourier parameters of the resampled polygons can be obtained efficiently by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The experimental results show that the appearances of the morphed objects are superior to the ones obtained by the methods available.

71749116422	Weather-adaptive flying target detection and tracking from infrared video sequences	This paper proposes a new computer-aided tracking method that can track multiple flying targets in an image sequence acquired from either an optical camera or an infrared camera system. The proposed method includes two major steps, which are flying target detection and flying target tracking. Because weather conditions greatly affect the detection of a flying target, we designed a fuzzy system that classifies the weather into two basic weather types. Based on the weather type, flying targets can be detected successfully. In tracking a flying target, we apply the dynamic layer representation method to represent the flying target and use a Kalman filter to predict the target's position. The second fuzzy rule system is designed to identify the target states, which are visible, missing, or occluded, based on the layer and positional features. Thereafter, the identified state can help to select a suitable tracking strategy for the subsequent frames. In the experiments, we demonstrate the results applied to five real image sequences. The proposed method can successfully detect and track multiple flying targets perfectly in clear weather. It also achieves around 90% accuracy when the weather is not clear. The fuzzy methodology makes the proposed system more effective at detecting and tracking targets and more flexible to complex environmental conditions, since the rules can be easily added and modified. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

74049121946	Color-based tumor tissue segmentation for the automated estimation of oral cancer parameters	This article presents an automatic color-based feature extraction system for parameter estimation of oral cancer from optical microscopic images. The system first reduces image-to-image variations by means of color normalization. We then construct a database which consists of typical cancer images. The color parameters extracted from this database are then used in automated online sampling from oral cancer images. Principal component analysis is subsequently used to divide the color features into four tissue types. Each pixel in the cancer image is then classified into the corresponding tissue types based on the Mahalanobis distance. The aforementioned procedures are all fully automated; in particular, the automated sampling step greatly reduces the need for intensive labor in manual sampling and training. Experiments reveal high levels of consistency among the results achieved using the manual, semiautomatic, and fully automatic methods. Parameter comparisons between the four cancer stages are conducted, and only the mean parameters between early and late cancer stages are statistically different. In summary, the proposed system provides a useful and convenient tool for automatic segmentation and evaluation for stained biopsy samples of oral cancer. This tool can also be modified and applied to other tissue images with similar staining conditions. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77951010548	Automated segmentation for patella from lateral knee X-ray images	X-ray image segmentation is an important issue in medical image analysis. Due to inconsistent X-ray absorption, the intensities are usually unevenly distributed and noisy in the processed organ, thus the object segmentation becomes difficult. In this paper we propose a new segmentation method for patella from the lateral knee X-ray images based on the active shape model (ASM). At first, a patella shape model is constructed by principal component analysis (PCA) of corresponding landmarks obtained from a set of training shape. As the knee X-ray image usually contains many anatomical structures, we design a strategy based on edge tracing to place the initial shape model as close to the patella boundary as possible. Then, the shape model is deformed and fitted to the patella boundary by using a dual-optimization approach that includes a genetic algorithm (GA) to get the global geometric transform and ASM to deform the shape model iteratively. Consequently, the proposed method can cope with different knee X-ray images and can segment the patella in an automatic procedure. In the experiment, 20 images were tested and promising results are obtained by the proposed method. This method is found useful for the clinical evaluation and biomechanical study of knee. ©2009 IEEE.

77951014921	Registration-based segmentation of nerve cells in microscopy images	Nerve cell segmentation is important for better understanding of the connections between broken nerves. In this paper, we propose a registration-based segmentation to improve the segmentation from a series of microscopic image sequence. A global iterative closest point (ICP) registration is first employed to find the corresponding cells between neighboring frames. Then a local ICP registration is adopted to refine shape matching between corresponding cells. When registering the current frame to the previous frame, a missing cell in the current frame can obtain a dummy region with respect to the previous frame. The dummy region is then confirmed as a cell by checking the correspondence of the cell among the previous, current and next frames. Experimental results show that the proposed registration based algorithm recovers the cells that are missed in conventional segmentation. ©2009 IEEE.

77951613825	Watershed segmentation with automatic altitude selection and region merging based on the markov random field model	Watershed transformation has proven to be an important tool in image analysis. However, the resulting image of watershed transformation is inevitably over-segmented due to the presence of noise or local irregularities in the input image. In this paper, the use of contour altitude at the immersion stage is proposed. Block gradient information computed from the input gradient image is defined and used to obtain a critical altitude of watershed flooding. This altitude is then refined based on entropy estimated from the intermediate segmentation result. Thereafter, an optimal altitude and its corresponding segmentation result can be obtained. Although this process can favorably reduce the number of regions, the quality of segmentation still requires further improvement. Hence, a Markov Random Field (MRF) model defined on a region adjacency graph (RAG) is adopted. Because the MRF model can merge neighboring regions that are similar in local statistic properties, it thus alleviates the over-segmentation problem and improves the quality of image segmentation. In the experimental studies, the proposed method has been tested using several benchmark images. It achieves improved appearance and energy indices in comparison with the results obtained by conventional methods. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

77952237187	A motion compounding technique for speckle reduction in ultrasound images	The quality of ultrasound images is usually influenced by speckle noise and the temporal decorrelation of the speckle patterns. To reduce the speckle noise, compounding techniques have been widely applied. Partially correlated images scanned on the same subject cross-section are combined to generate a compound image with improved image quality. However, the compounding technique might introduce image blurring if the transducer or the target moves too fast. This blurring effect becomes especially critical when assessing tissue deformation in clinical motion examinations. In this paper, an ultrasound motion compounding system is proposed to improve the quality of ultrasound motion sequences. The proposed motion compounding technique uses a hierarchical adaptive feature weighted motion estimation method to realign the frames before compounding. Each frame is first registered and warped to the reference frame before being compounded to reduce the speckle noise. Experimental results showed that the motion could be assessed accurately and better visualization could be achieved for the compound images, with improved signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. © 2008 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

77953490969	Registration-based segmentation with articulated model from multipostural magnetic resonance images for hand bone motion animation	Purpose: The quantitative measurements of hand bones, including volume, surface, orientation, and position are essential in investigating hand kinematics. Moreover, within the measurement stage, bone segmentation is the most important step due to its certain influences on measuring accuracy. Since hand bones are small and tubular in shape, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is prone to artifacts such as nonuniform intensity and fuzzy boundaries. Thus, greater detail is required for improving segmentation accuracy. The authors then propose using a novel registration-based method on an articulated hand model to segment hand bones from multipostural MR images. Methods: The proposed method consists of the model construction and registration-based segmentation stages. Given a reference postural image, the first stage requires construction of a drivable reference model characterized by hand bone shapes, intensity patterns, and articulated joint mechanism. By applying the reference model to the second stage, the authors initially design a model-based registration pursuant to intensity distribution similarity, MR bone intensity properties, and constraints of model geometry to align the reference model to target bone regions of the given postural image. The authors then refine the resulting surface to improve the superimposition between the registered reference model and target bone boundaries. Results: For each subject, given a reference postural image, the proposed method can automatically segment all hand bones from all other postural images. Compared to the ground truth from two experts, the resulting surface image had an average margin of error within 1 mm (mm) only. In addition, the proposed method showed good agreement on the overlap of bone segmentations by dice similarity coefficient and also demonstrated better segmentation results than conventional methods. Conclusions: The proposed registration-based segmentation method can successfully overcome drawbacks caused by inherent artifacts in MR images and obtain more accurate segmentation results automatically. Moreover, realistic hand motion animations can be generated based on the bone segmentation results. The proposed method is found helpful for understanding hand bone geometries in dynamic postures that can be used in simulating 3D hand motion through multipostural MR images. © 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Several image processing strategies are used to detect and outline the defects. The detected defects are then classified into different defect types by using a hierarchical neural network classifier. Some manual detection results by field experts are used to verify the correctness of the proposed detection. In defect classification, the results show that the relevance vector machine (RVM) has better accuracy than the back propagation neural network (BPN).

Functional MRI by blood oxygenation level dependent measurements was performed while tactile stimulation was applied to the face or neck area. Nonpainful tactile stimuli were manually delivered by an experimenter at a frequency of ~1 Hz. Block (epoch) design was adopted with a block duration of 30 s and a whole run duration of 6 min. For each location, two runs were performed. After the image data were preprocessed, both parameteric and nonparametric methods were performed to test the group results. The results showed that (1) unilateral face or neck stimulation could elicit bilateral cortical activation, (2) mainly the face representation and face-hand junction areas, but not the conventional neck representation area, were activated by face or neck stimulation, and (3) the activation areas were larger when right face or neck was stimulated. In conclusion, the sensory cortical representation area of the anterior neck region was mainly at the junction of hand and face representation area and the activated area was larger when the right face or neck was stimulated.

78650015840	Automatic Insall-Salvati ratio measurement on lateral knee x-ray images using model-guided landmark localization	The Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR) is important for detecting two common clinical signs of knee disease: patella alta and patella baja. Furthermore, large interoperator differences in ISR measurement make an objective measurement system necessary for better clinical evaluation. In this paper, we define three specific bony landmarks for determining the ISR and then propose an x-ray image analysis system to localize these landmarks and measure the ISR. Due to inherent artifacts in x-ray images, such as unevenly distributed intensities, which make landmark localization difficult, we hence propose a registrationassisted active-shape model (RAASM) to localize these landmarks. We first construct a statistical model from a set of training images based on x-ray image intensity and patella shape. Since a knee x-ray image contains specific anatomical structures, we then design an algorithm, based on edge tracing, for patella feature extraction in order to automatically align the model to the patella image. We can estimate the landmark locations as well as the ISR after registration-assisted model fitting. Our proposed method successfully overcomes drawbacks caused by x-ray image artifacts. Experimental results show great agreement between the ISRs measured by the proposed method and by orthopedic clinicians. © 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

79851473032	Segmentation of flexor tendons within carpal tunnel from magnetic resonance image	Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common peripheral neuropathies. For evaluation of the CTS, segmentation of carpal tunnel and its contents from magnetic resonance (MR) images is rather important. In this paper we propose a new segmentation framework for the flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel on MR images. The proposed method consists of two stages including construction of reference tendon contour (RTC) and registration-based segmentation. Initially, we segment the flexor tendons from the most proximally cross-sectional image using watershed algorithm. The resulting segmented tendons then serve as the RTCs and are applied to the registration-based segmentation stage. Each of the RTCs in this stage is registered to its distally adjacent image by a rigid transformation and then its shape is refined by snake deformation. The registration-based segmentation is sequentially performed on each pair of adjacent cross-sectional images along the proximal to distal direction until the most distal image is segmented. Consequently, the flexor tendons in the entire MR volume can be automatically segmented. In the experiments three MR volumes were used to validate the accuracy of the proposed method. Compared to the manual results, our proposed method showed good agreement on the tendon segmentations with dice similarity coefficient above 0.8. ©2010 IEEE.

79952601210	Three-dimensional reconstruction of cranial defect using active contour model and image registration	In neurosurgery, cranial incisions during craniotomy can be recovered by cranioplasty-a surgical operation using cranial implants to repair skull defects. However, surgeons often encounter difficulties when grafting prefabricated cranial plates into defective areas, since a perfect match to the cranial incision is difficult to achieve. Previous studies using mirroring technique, surface interpolation, or deformed template had limitations in skull reconstruction to match the patient's original appearance. For this study, we utilized low-resolution and high-resolution computed tomography images from the patient to repair skull defects, whilst preserving the original shape. Since the accuracy of skull reconstruction was associated with the partial volume effects in the low-resolution images and the percentage of the skull defect in the high-resolution images, the low-resolution images with intact skull were resampled and thresholded followed by active contour model to suppress partial volume artifacts. The resulting low-resolution images were registered with the high-resolution ones, which exhibited different percentages of cranial defect, to extract the incised cranial part. Finally, mesh smoothing refined the three-dimensional model of the cranial defect. Simulation results indicate that the reconstruction was 93.94% accurate for a 20% skull material removal, and 97.76% accurate for 40% skull material removal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively creates a customized implant, which can readily be used in cranioplasty. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

In this paper, we propose a new registration algorithm which uses the mutual information (MI) as the similarity measurement function and utilizes a new optimization algorithm, called honey bee mating optimization (HBMO), to obtain the optimal registration. By simulating the biological evolution, HBMO can obtain a set of optimized parameters for registration with the largest similarity measure. By applying the proposed method to medical images, the experimental results showed that the method achieved better accuracy in registration than the conventional Powell's optimization method which is the most commonly used method in medical image registration. Also, the proposed method remained stable and accurate during the experiment of using several different source images. With each source image, we calculated mean SD of the parameters by repeating twenty times. © 2010 IEEE.

79958768183	Functional evaluation using multistep registration with standard magnetic resonance and ADAM brain images	OBJECTIVE: Image analysis of I ADAM single photon emission computed tomography is used to evaluate the functional activities in apparatus or in the brain regions. We have earlier proposed a two-step registration method for registering intrasubject long-time 2-[(2-((dimethyl-amino) methyl)phenyl)thio]- 5-iodophenylamine (ADAM) images. However, this method requires acquisition of individual MRI, 10-min ADAM, and 6-h ADAM images. METHODS: In this study, we propose using standard (std) brains to replace the individual MRI and 10-min ADAM images. We first use the MRIstd instead of the individual MRI. We then use the 10-min ADAMstd to replace the individual 10-min ADAM image. RESULTS: The results produced using the MRIstd method are close to the original two-step registration method (specific/nonspecific binding ratio, 4.211 vs. 4.326, P=0.055); and the 10 min ADAMstd method is close to the MRIstd method (specific/nonspecific binding ratio, 4.095 vs. 4.211, P=0.070). CONCLUSION: The proposed 10-min ADAMstd method yields acceptable quantitative measurements and significantly reduces patient loading by eliminating the additional individual MRI and 10-min ADAM imaging. More important, the interobserver problem can be solved because the area of interest (AOI) is drawn on the MRIstd once; the AOI drawn on the MRIstd can be mapped onto the registered 10-min ADAMstd, and the individual 6 h ADAM image can then be automatically evaluated with the AOI on the 10-min ADAMstd after the proposed registration. Thus, the examination of I ADAM thus becomes less expensive, more convenient, and useful for clinical applications. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

79959882643	A hybrid strategy to integrate surface-based and mutual-information-based methods for co-registering brain SPECT and MR images	Co-registration of brain SPECT and MR images has been used extensively in clinical applications. The complementary features of two major co-registration methods-surface- and mutual-information-based (MI-based)-motivated us to study a hybrid-based scheme that uses the surface-based method to achieve a quick alignment, followed by the MI-based method for fine tuning. Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of surface-, MI-, and hybrid-based registration methods by designing different levels of noise and mismatch in the registration experiments. Results demonstrated that the hybrid surface-MI-based scheme outperforms both the surface- and MI-based methods in providing superior accuracy and success rates. Specifically, the translational and rotational errors were no more than 1 mm and 2°, respectively, with consistent success rates over 98%. Besides, the hybrid-based method saved 12-53% of the computation efforts, compared with using the MI-based method alone. We recommend the use of hybrid-based method when the orientational differences between the floating and reference images exceed 10°. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

79960601061	A computer vision system for automated container code recognition	Container code examination is an essential step in the container flow management. To date, this step is mostly achieved by human visual inspections, which are however time-consuming and error-prone. We hence propose a new computer vision system for automated container code recognition. The proposed system consists of model construction and code recognition stages. In the model construction stage, we first incorporate a locally thresholding method with prior knowledge of code character geometry to segment the code characters, including English characters A-Z and numeric characters 0-9, from a training set of container images. With the segmentation results of each character, we subsequently construct its Eigen-feature model using the principal component analysis (PCA). In the recognition stage, the code characters are firstly segmented from the given container image. Each segmented character is then recognized by finding the best matched Eigen-feature model that maintains the minimal PCA reconstruction error of the character appearance. Experiments showed that the proposed method achieved the code recognition with a high recognition rate and little recognition time for each image automatically. Overall, our proposed system has great potential for improving the efficiency of container terminals as well as enhancing the container management.

79961034318	Unsupervised fuzzy c-means clustering for motor imagery EEG recognition	In this study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) recognition system is proposed on single-trial motor imagery (MI) data. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering is used for the unsupervised recognition of left and right MI data by combining with selected active segments and multiresolution fractal features. Active segment selection is used to detect active segments situated at most discriminable areas in the time-frequency domain. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted by using modified fractal dimension from wavelet data. Finally, FCM clustering is used as the discriminant of MI features. The FCM clustering is an adaptive approach suitable for the clustering of non-stationary biomedical signals. Compared with several popular supervised classifiers, FCM clustering provides a potential for BCI application. © 2011 ICIC International.

84055213165	Model-based segmentation of flexor tendons from magnetic resonance images of finger joints	Trigger finger is a common hand disease, causing swelling, painful popping and clicking in moving the affected finger joint. To better evaluate patients with trigger finger, segmentation of flexor tendons from magnetic resonance (MR) images of finger joints, which can offer detailed structural information of tendons to clinicians, is essential. This paper presents a novel model-based method with three stages for automatically segmenting the flexor tendons. In the first stage, a set of tendon contour models (TCMs) is initialized from the most proximal cross-sectional image via two-step ellipse estimation. Each of the TCMs is then propagated to its distally adjacent image by affine registration. The propagation is sequentially performed along the proximal-distal direction until the most distal image is reached, as the second stage of segmentation. The TCMs on each cross-sectional image are refined in the last stage with the snake deformation. MR volumes of three subjects were used to validate the segmentation accuracy. Compared with the manual results, our method showed good accuracy with small average margins of errors (within 0.5 mm) and large overlapping ratio (dice similarity coefficient above 0.8). Overall, the proposed method has great potential for morphological change assessment of flexor tendons and pulley-tendon system modeling for image guided surgery. © 2011 IEEE.

84860196211	Color correction with hue-determined compensation for illumination changing	Color correction is important in vision applications. We aim to improve conventional transformation with a linear hypothesis of color correction (i.e., von Kries method) by innovatively using a hue-determined matrix. A new model, named the hue-compensated diagonal model (HCDM), is proposed to benefit correcting colors with chromatic-saturated illuminations. Inspired by the chromatic adaptation occurring in the human visual system (HVS), the HCDM reinforces the illuminant complementary color by weighting the von Kries coefficients. These HCDM weighting terms, being illuminant-hue specific based on the relative absorption model (RAM), consist of the proposed hue-chromatic characteristic function with learning parameters. As a result, the HCDM out-performed both the principle component analysis (PCA) approach and the von Kries method in most synthetic experiments, and achieved better results than the von Kries method in real image experiments. Thus, the proposed HCDM, with global-processing capability and real-image applicability, can be used as an effective model in color reproductions and image applications. © 2012 SPIE and IS&T.

84860400641	A coarse-to-fine auto-focusing algorithm for microscopic image	Auto-focusing is an important step in development a computer-aided evaluation system for diagnostic microscope. An auto-focusing algorithm can identify the best focus reliably and objectively, and prevents the tedious and time consuming steps of manual focusing. In this paper, a coarse-to-fine auto-focusing method is proposed based on a multi-resolution scheme which locates the focusing range by quadratic polynomial fitting in low resolution and achieves accurate focal point by using binary search in fine resolution. An algorithm was developed to identify the focal point under multiple image resolution with the Sum of Modified Laplacian (SML) as the focusing value. The main contribution of this system is to reduce the auto-focusing time. Comparing with the conventional binary search, the coarse-to-fine method only needs half of the time to accomplish auto-focusing. Using the proposed technique, the efficiency of auto-focusing system has been significantly improved. © 2011 IEEE.

84862801626	Segmentation of nerve fibers using multi-level gradient watershed and fuzzy systems	Objective: This paper presents an algorithm based on multi-level watershed segmentation combined with three fuzzy systems to segment a large number of myelinated nerve fibers in microscope images. The method can estimate various geometrical parameters of myelinated nerve fibers in peripheral nerves. It is expected to be a promising tool for the quantitative assessment of myelinated nerve fibers in related research. Materials and methods: A novel multi-level watershed scheme iteratively detects pre-candidate nerve fibers. At each immersion level, watershed segmentation extracts the initial axon locations and obtains meaningful myelinated nerve fiber features. Thereafter, according to a priori characteristics of the myelinated nerve fibers, fuzzy rules reject unlikely pre-candidates and collect a set of candidates. Initial candidate boundaries are then refined by a fuzzy active contour model, which flexibly deforms contours according to the observed features of each nerve fiber. A final scan with a different set of fuzzy rules based on the a priori properties of the myelinated nerve fibers removes false detections. A particle swarm optimization method is employed to efficiently train the large number of parameters in the proposed fuzzy systems. Results: The proposed method can automatically segment the transverse cross-sections of nerve fibers obtained from optical microscope images. Although the microscope image is usually noisy with weak or variable levels of contrast, the proposed system can handle images with a large number of myelinated nerve fibers and achieve a high fiber detection ratio. As compared to manual segmentation by experts, the proposed system achieved an average accuracy of 91% across different data sets. Conclusion: We developed an image segmentation system that automatically handles myelinated nerve fibers in microscope images. Experimental results showed the efficacy of this system and its superiority to other nerve fiber segmentation approaches. Moreover, the proposed method can be extended to other applications of automatic segmentation of microscopic images. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84862748708	3D/2D model-to-image registration for quantitative dietary assessment	Image-based dietary assessment is important for health monitoring and management because it can provide quantitative and objective information, such as food volume, nutrition type, and calorie intake. In this paper, a new framework, 3D/2D model-to-image registration, is presented for estimating food volume from a single-view 2D image containing a reference object (i.e., a circular dining plate). First, the food is segmented from the background image based on Otsu's thresholding and morphological operations. Next, the food volume is obtained from a user-selected, 3D shape model. The position, orientation and scale of the model are optimized by a model-to-image registration process. Then, the circular plate in the image is fitted and its spatial information is used as constraints for solving the registration problem. Our method takes the global contour information of the shape model into account to obtain a reliable food volume estimate. Experimental results using regularly shaped test objects and realistically shaped food models with known volumes both demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2012 IEEE.

84862792716	Registration-Based Segmentation of Three-Dimensional Ultrasound Images for Quantitative Measurement of Fetal Craniofacial Structure	Segmentation of a fetal head from three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound images is a critical step in the quantitative measurement of fetal craniofacial structure. However, two main issues complicate segmentation, including fuzzy boundaries and large variations in pose and shape among different ultrasound images. In this article, we propose a new registration-based method for automatically segmenting the fetal head from 3-D ultrasound images. The proposed method first detects the eyes based on Gabor features to identify the pose of the fetus image. Then, a reference model, which is constructed from a fetal phantom and contains prior knowledge of head shape, is aligned to the image . via feature-based registration. Finally, 3-D snake deformation is utilized to improve the boundary fitness between the model and image. Four clinically useful parameters including inter-orbital diameter (IOD), bilateral orbital diameter (BOD), occipital frontal diameter (OFD) and bilateral parietal diameter (BPD) are measured based on the results of the eye detection and head segmentation. Ultrasound volumes from 11 subjects were used for validation of the method accuracy. Experimental results showed that the proposed method was able to overcome the aforementioned difficulties and achieve good agreement between automatic and manual measurements. © 2012 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84863123311	Automatic inspection system for billet	In billet production, the quality of billet is an important issue to assure. In this study, we proposed an automatic inspection system to locate and classify defects for billet. The proposed system is consisted of three modules: (1) image processing and defect location, (2) feature extraction and selection, (3) incremental learning classifier. In the first module, the region of interest is extracted and normalized to reduce the effects of uneven illumination. We then develop two methods to detect different types of defects based on their characteristics. In the second module, k-nearest neighbor classifier and tabu search are employed to select the best set of features for classification. In the last module, a classifier with incremental learning capability called Learn is used to classify the detected defects. Experiments show that the proposed system provides defect detection with good accuracy and speed. Comparing with the conventional BPN, the Learn++ classifier is much more efficient in training and obtains better classification rates. © 2011 IEEE.

However, the current measurement process is mostly based on manual estimation which is subjective and time-consuming. We hence propose an automatic method for quantitatively measuring the pathological change of pulley tissue from microscopic images. We first apply the color normalization to normalize all the acquired images. Then we use a three-stepped color segmentation process to extract the areas of diseased tissues. On the other hand, we also apply an active double thresholding scheme to segment the nuclei and extract shape features of nucleus. At last, the ratio of abnormal tissue area and the ratio of abnormal nuclei are calculated as the indices for the evaluation of trigger finger disease. The result showed good correlation between the expert judgments and the measured parameters. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

However, current measurement process is mostly achieved by manual estimation which is subjective and time-consuming. We hence propose a two-stage method to automatically segment axons and myelin sheaths from microscopic images for measuring the cell morphology quantitatively. First, an automatic thresholding method is used to obtain axon candidates and then geometric and image properties are used to assure the axon regions. Second, the outer contour of myelin sheath is segmented using the active contour model with the obtained axon contour as the initial solution. Then, the desired morphological parameters can be readily measured. In the experiments, we used seven nerve images for accuracy validation and achieved very small contour distance errors (less than 0.5 μm with nerve diameter around 8 μm in average). Overall, the proposed method is found efficient and useful in nerve parameter evaluation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

0037005657	Texture feature coding method for classification of liver sonography	This paper introduces a new texture analysis method called texture feature coding method (TFCM) for classification of ultrasonic liver images. The TFCM transforms a gray-level image into a feature image in which each pixel is represented by a texture feature number (TFN) coded by TFCM. The TFNs obtained are used to generate a TFN histogram and a TFN co-occurrence matrix (CM), which produces texture feature descriptors for classification. Four conventional texture analysis methods that are gray-level CM, texture spectrum, statistical feature matrix and fractal dimension, are used also to classify liver sonography for comparison. The supervised maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers implemented by different type texture features are applied to discriminate ultrasonic liver images into three disease states that are normal liver, liver hepatitis and cirrhosis. The 30 liver sample images proven by needle biopsy are used to train the ML system that classify on a set of 90 test sample images. Experimental results show that the ML classifier together with TFCM texture features outperforms one with the four conventional methods with respect to classification accuracy. Copyright © 2002 .

0037286322	Initial experience of using color kinesis in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease	Background. Color kinesis (CK) is a recently developed echocardiographic technique. This report describes our initial effort in the validation of the use of CK for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods. Two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography and CK were studied in 30 normal subjects and 24 CAD patients. Coronary angiography was performed in the 24 patients. Significant (> 70% luminal diameter stenosis) CAD was present in 18 patients (79%), all of whom had history of myocardial infarction. Regional fractional area change in each segment was displayed as a stacked color histogram. The histograms derived from these 30 normal subjects were averaged to obtain the normal pattern of left ventricular contraction; the mean value ± 1 SD was considered the reference histogram. When the regional fractional area change deviated from this normal reference, this segment was considered as having regional wall motion abnormality. The detection of wall motion abnormalities by visual interpretation of 2-D echocardiography, reviewing the CK loop recording, and CK stacked histograms were compared. To assess the relationship of measurement of endocardial excursion of CK images, the width of the color band was measured at the midpoint of each segment along a line perpendicular to the cardiac border. The endocardial excursion measured by 2 independent observers was compared using linear regression analysis and calculation of intraclass correlation coefficient. Results. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of CAD were 77.8% and 66.6%, respectively, for CK loop reviewing, 83.3% and 66.7% for CK stacked histogram analysis, and 77.8% and 83.3% for 2-D echocardiography. The overall accuracies for CAD detection were 75% for CK loop reviewing, 79.2% for CK stacked histogram analysis, and 79.2% for the 2-D echocardiography (not significant in all comparisons). The correlation of measurement of endocardial excursion from the CK images by 2-observers was good (r = 0.85, p < 0.01), and intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.99 (p<0.0001). Conclusions. Our data demonstrate that both the CK loop reviewing and stacked histogram analysis were comparable to 2-D echocardiography for detecting CAD.

0036891008	Voxel-based texture mapping for medical data	In computerized image and graphic applications, texture mapping is one of the most commonly used methods to improve the realism or to enhance the visual effect of object rendering without too much increase in computational complexity. The conventional method usually has to transfer three-dimensional (3D) object to the polygonal structure, and is computationally expensive. As the medical data are mostly in voxel format, the polygonal structure is not efficient or requires more complicated mechanism in retrieving the internal information of medical data. In this paper, we propose a new texture mapping method, based on flattening a chain-coded 3D surface, to handle the voxel-based data directly. The method flattens the 3D object surface onto a two-dimensional (2D) plane and then uses 2D metamorphosis to generate the correspondences between object surface and texture image. Therefore, polygon transformation is no longer necessary and texture mapping is handled with inexpensive 2D morphing. More importantly, the internal information of medical data can be easily preserved and utilized further. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0038463585	Statistical lesion classification on brain SPECT images	Recent researches [1] have shown that individuals with more years of education have a more advanced development in Alzheimer's disease (AD) than those who with fewer years of education. In this study, two groups of fifty-eight AD patients with different education levels were examined. We utilize two statistical methods to detect the significant difference in brain region perfusion between the high and low education level patients with AD. The contextual clustering method, similar to the one for MR lesion detection in [2], is designed and applied to the 99mTc-hexamethyl propylenamine oxime (HMPAO) brain SPECT images. The other uses the SPM99 software that is commonly applied in voxel by voxel analysis of SPECT data and is popularly adopted in neuroimaging society over the past few years [3, 4]. Our finding suggests that there are significantly reductions in region perfusion in the group of high education level patients compared with the group of low education level patients. These reductions were observed in the left temporal region.

84874654674	Using three-dimensional multigrid-based snake and multiresolution image registration for reconstruction of cranial defect	In cranioplasty, neurosurgeons use bone grafts to repair skull defects. To ensure the protection of intracranial tissues and recover the original head shape for aesthetic purposes, a custom-made pre-fabricated prosthesis must match the cranial incision as closely as possible. In our previous study (Liao et al. in Med Biol Eng Comput 49:203-211, 2011), we proposed an algorithm consisting of the 2D snake and image registration using the patient's own diagnostic low-resolution and defective high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images to repair the impaired skull. In this study, we developed a 3D multigrid snake and employed multiresolution image registration to improve the computational efficiency. After extracting the defect portion images, we designed an image-trimming process to remove the bumped inner margin that can facilitate the placement of skull implants without manual trimming during surgery. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a set of skull phantoms were manufactured to simulate six different conditions of cranial defects, namely, unilateral, bilateral, and cross-midline defects with 20 or 40 % skull defects. The overall image processing time in reconstructing the defect portion images can be reduced from 3 h to 20 min, as compared with our previous method. Furthermore, the reconstruction accuracies using the 3D multigrid snake were superior to those using the 2D snake. © 2012 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

84878169264	Quantifying catch-and-release: The extensor tendon force needed to overcome the catching flexors in trigger fingers	The extensor tendon forces required to overcome the catching flexors in trigger fingers are unknown. A biomechanical model with moment equilibrium equations and method of least squares was developed for estimating the tendon force at triggering in trigger fingers. Trigger fingers that exhibited significant catching and sudden release during finger extension were tested. A customized "pulling tester" was used to pull the finger from flexion to extension and provide synchronic measurement of the pulling force. The displacement of the tested finger was measured by a motion capture system. This preliminary study presents kinematic and kinetic data at triggering of 10 trigger fingers. The distal and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints presented sudden release while the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint started extension in the early phase of finger extension. The tendon tension of flexor digitorum profundus was greater than that of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) in six fingers, and less than that of FDS in three fingers. The tension of two flexor tendons was almost equal in one finger. At the PIP and MCP joints, 1.54 times the force of flexors was needed for the extensors to overcome the catching flexors in trigger fingers. This biomechanical model provides clinicians with a clearer idea of the tendon force at triggering. The quantitative results may help in the understanding of movement characteristics of trigger fingers. These findings are useful to better understand the etiology and nature of trigger finger development, and thus aid in further development of better assessments and treatments related to this. © 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society.

84879393708	Computer aided quantification of pathological features for flexor tendon pulleys on microscopic images	Quantifying the pathological features of flexor tendon pulleys is essential for grading the trigger finger since it provides clinicians with objective evidence derived from microscopic images. Although manual grading is time consuming and dependent on the observer experience, there is a lack of image processing methods for automatically extracting pulley pathological features. In this paper, we design and develop a color-based image segmentation system to extract the color and shape features from pulley microscopic images. Two parameters which are the size ratio of abnormal tissue regions and the number ratio of abnormal nuclei are estimated as the pathological progression indices. The automatic quantification results show clear discrimination among different levels of diseased pulley specimens which are prone to misjudgments for human visual inspection. The proposed system provides a reliable and automatic way to obtain pathological parameters instead of manual evaluation which is with intra- and interoperator variability. Experiments with 290 microscopic images from 29 pulley specimens show good correspondence with pathologist expectations. Hence, the proposed system has great potential for assisting clinical experts in routine histopathological examinations. © 2013 Yung-Chun Liu et al.

84881188890	A new framework for segmentation of flexor tendons within carpal tunnel from magnetic resonance images	Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common peripheral neuropathies. To evaluate CTS, segmentation of the flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel from magnetic resonance (MR) images is rather important. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation framework for flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel on MR images. The proposed method consists of two stages, including reference tendon contour (RTC) construction and registration-based segmentation. Initially, we segment the flexor tendons from the most proximally crosssectional image using the watershed algorithm. The segmented tendons then serve as the RTCs, which are applied to the subsequent registration-based segmentation. Each resulting RTC in the current MR image is registered to its distally adjacent image by a rigid transformation and then is refined by the snake deformation. The registration-based segmentation is sequentially applied on each pair of adjacent cross-sectional images along the proximal to distal direction until the most distal image is segmented. Consequently, the flexor tendons in the entire MR volume are automatically segmented. In the experiments, three MR volumes were used to validate the accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method showed good agreement on tendon segmentations as compared to the manual results by demonstrating an averaged dice similarity coefficient above 0.8. Moreover, we also demonstrated better segmentation results than conventional methods. The proposed automated segmentation method is helpful for quantitatively measuring the flexor tendons, such as their volumes and shape parameters. Copyright © 2011 American Scientific Publishers.

84880806484	Automatic and quantitative measurement of collagen gel contraction using model-guided segmentation	Quantitative measurement of collagen gel contraction plays a critical role in the field of tissue engineering because it provides spatial-temporal assessment (e.g., changes of gel area and diameter during the contraction process) reflecting the cell behavior and tissue material properties. So far the assessment of collagen gels relies on manual segmentation, which is time-consuming and suffers from serious intra- and inter-observer variability. In this study, we propose an automatic method combining various image processing techniques to resolve these problems. The proposed method first detects the maximal feasible contraction range of circular references (e.g., culture dish) and avoids the interference of irrelevant objects in the given image. Then, a three-step color conversion strategy is applied to normalize and enhance the contrast between the gel and background. We subsequently introduce a deformable circular model which utilizes regional intensity contrast and circular shape constraint to locate the gel boundary. An adaptive weighting scheme was employed to coordinate the model behavior, so that the proposed system can overcome variations of gel boundary appearances at different contraction stages. Two measurements of collagen gels (i.e., area and diameter) can readily be obtained based on the segmentation results. Experimental results, including 120 gel images for accuracy validation, showed high agreement between the proposed method and manual segmentation with an average dice similarity coefficient larger than 0.95. The results also demonstrated obvious improvement in gel contours obtained by the proposed method over two popular, generic segmentation methods. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84884369365	Model-based spike detection of epileptic EEG data	Accurate automatic spike detection is highly beneficial to clinical assessment of epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) data. In this paper, a new two-stage approach is proposed for epileptic spike detection. First, the k-point nonlinear energy operator (k-NEO) is adopted to detect all possible spike candidates, then a newly proposed spike model with slow wave features is applied to these candidates for spike classification. Experimental results show that the proposed system, using the AdaBoost classifier, outperforms the conventional method in both two- and three-class EEG pattern classification problems. The proposed system not only achieves better accuracy for spike detection, but also provides new ability to differentiate between spikes and spikes with slow waves. Though spikes with slow waves occur frequently in epileptic EEGs, they are not used in conventional spike detection. Identifying spikes with slow waves allows the proposed system to have better capability for assisting clinical neurologists in routine EEG examinations and epileptic diagnosis. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84884894489	Model-based measurement of food portion size for image-based dietary assessment using 3D/2D registration	Dietary assessment is important in health maintenance and intervention in many chronic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, there is currently a lack of convenient methods for measuring the volume of food (portion size) in real-life settings. We present a computational method to estimate food volume from a single photographic image of food contained on a typical dining plate. First, we calculate the food location with respect to a 3D camera coordinate system using the plate as a scale reference. Then, the food is segmented automatically from the background in the image. Adaptive thresholding and snake modeling are implemented based on several image features, such as color contrast, regional color homogeneity and curve bending degree. Next, a 3D model representing the general shape of the food (e.g., a cylinder, a sphere, etc) is selected from a pre-constructed shape model library. The position, orientation and scale of the selected shape model are determined by registering the projected 3D model and the food contour in the image, where the properties of the reference are used as constraints. Experimental results using various realistically shaped foods with known volumes demonstrated satisfactory performance of our image-based food volume measurement method even if the 3D geometric surface of the food is not completely represented in the input image. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, these assessments currently rely on manual processing, which is time-consuming and subjective to personal opinions. We present a multiresolution image analysis system for automatic quantification of gel contraction. This system includes a color conversion process to normalize and enhance the contrast between gel and background. Then, a deformable circular model is activated automatically to capture details of gel boundaries. These steps are coordinated by a multiresolution strategy. The target measurements are obtained after gel segmentation. Our experiments using 30 images demonstrated a high consistency between the proposed and manual segmentation methods. The system can process large-size images (4000x3000) at a rate of approximately one second per image. It thus serves as a useful tool for analyzing large biological and biomaterial imaging datasets efficiently and objectively. © 2013 IEEE.

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging utilizing Tc-99m HMPAO is thus a popular method to assess brain function. In this paper, we present an image analysis system for SPECT images that performs a series of image processing procedures including 3D image registration, gray-level normalization, and brain extraction, which map all the 3D brain data to the same space for further analysis. Afterward, the aligned images undertake a standard statistical analysis, the paired t test, to detect the areas that have significant deviations between the two images. The statistical t map is then represented with a color plot for each brain slice to indicate the activation foci. The resulting maps are found very helpful to doctors for the lesion evaluation and localization in the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenic patients.

0041658898	Optimized semi-boundary (SB) rendering scheme	Volume rendering is a technique for visualizing 3D arrays of sampled data. Volume rendering, though capable of performing very effective visualization, is very computationally intensive. Semi-boundary (SB) is a compact data structure used to encode extracted surface from volume data. In this paper, we describe an incremental algorithm to shorten rendering of SB nodes. We define two projection rules to guarantee proper projection order and, thus, eiiminate the requirement for a Z-buffer. Using these two rules, we save data storage as well as rendering time. As a result, the proposed method can achieve interactive rendering performance for a large volume pelvis data set with a size of 512 × 512 × 245.

0345184237	Self-learning contour finding algorithm for echocardiac analysis	The detection of left ventricular boundary is an interesting and challenging task in the cardiac analysis. In this paper, a self-learning contour finding model derived based on the snake model is designed to detect the echocardiac boundaries. The proposed model utilizes the genetic algorithms as a training kernel to acquire the weights for the driving forces in the snake deformation. Thus, the weights can be treated as a priori knowledge of contour definition before the contour finding process is proceeded. Both the synthetic and real image experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

84888244435	A biplane-based approach to knee joint reconstruction without calibration	The existing reconstruction methods for stereoradiography require identifying specific anatomical landmarks projected from the radiographs such that they are not adapted to bones with continuous shapes. To release this limitation, we propose a generic-model-based approach to reconstructing the three-dimensional knee joint from two radiographs in an un-calibrated environment. The generic knee-joint model is built from CT image sets by using the marching cube algorithm first. The control points of the ASM (Active Shape Model) defined on the radiographs are registered to the 3D generic model by using the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. The generic model is deformed to obtain the real 3D knee joint by utilizing the RBF (Radial Basis Function). The experimental results show our method can reconstruct the knee joint model accurately and efficiently.

84891066788	Muscular motion estimation from 4-D ultrasound image using Kalman filter and rotation-invariant feature descriptor	Muscular motion estimation in ultrasound images is of great importance for investigating causes of musculoskeletal conditions in pathological examinations. However, the quality of ultrasound images is usually depressed due to speckle noises and temporal decorrelation of speckle patterns, making certain difficulties in motion estimation. To resolve the problem, this paper presents a new model-based tracking method for estimating the perimysium motion from 4-D ultrasound images. From the first frame of the given motion images, the proposed method builds a perimysium model, which consists of 3-D surface and rotation-invariant feature descriptor (RIFD) to characterize its structural and image appearances. Then, the model is applied to the next frame using Kalman filter for estimating the best matching position with the highest similarity of RIFD. The estimation is used to update the motion state for predicting and refining the model position in the next frame. The Kalman filtering is iteratively performed until the entire image sequence is processed. Overall, the proposed method efficiently combines the structure, image and motion priors, so it can overcome the aforementioned difficulties. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can provide reliable and accurate estimation of perimysium motion with tracking errors 6.26 voxels using three 4-D ultrasound volumes. © 2013 IEEE.

84891608494	A joint-constraint model-based system for reconstructing total knee motion	Comprehending knee motion is an essential requirement for studying the causes of knee disorders. In this paper, we propose a new 2-D-3-D registration system based on joint-constraint model for reconstructing total knee motion. The proposed model that contains bone geometries and an articulated joint mechanism is first constructed from multipostural magnetic resonancevolumetric images. Then, the bone segments of the model are hierarchically registered to each frame of the given single-plane fluoroscopic video that records the knee activity. The bone posture is iteratively optimized using a modified chamfer matching algorithm to yield the simulated radiograph which is the best fit to the underlying fluoroscopic image. Unlike conventional registration methods computing posture parameters for each bone independently, the proposed femorotibial and patellofemoral joint models properly maintain the articulations between femur, tibia, and patella during the registration processes. As a result, we can obtain a sequence of registered knee postures showing smooth and reasonable physiologic patterns of motion. The proposed system also provides joint-space interpolation to densely generate intermediate postures for motion animation. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by computer simulation, animal cadaver, and in vivo knee testing. The mean target registration errors for femur, tibia, and patella were less than 1.5 mm. In particular, small out-of-plane registration errors [less than 1 mm (translation) and 2° (rotation)] were achieved in animal cadaver assessments. © 2013 IEEE.

84891939844	Motor Learning of Normal Subjects Exercised with a Shoulder-Elbow Rehabilitation Robot	A shoulder-elbow rehabilitation robot has been developed as clinical treatments to facilitate motor learning and accelerate recovery of motor functions for stroke patients. However, the connection between motor learning and muscle activation patterns for stroke patients remained unknown. This study was tried to fulfill the gap by examining the muscle coordination and motor learning strategies of normal subjects while they interacted with the rehabilitation robot. A Hill-type biomechanical model based on twelve shoulder and elbow muscles was hence constructed for the upper-limb to simulate the interaction. Two normal subjects were recruited to perform upper limb circular tracking movements, clockwise and counterclockwise, on transverse plane at shoulder level in a designed force field generated by the rehabilitation robot. From the inverse dynamics analysis, the interaction was analyzed and the patterns of muscle activation were calculated. EMG signals of eight upper limb muscles were also measured for model validation and muscle coordination observation. The principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to distinguish different groups of muscle co-activation. Results showed that the constructed biomechanical model may be used as a tool for evaluating effects of treatment and be utilized as a blueprint for the design of the training protocol for the stroke patients.

84891799806	True color blood flow imaging using a high-speed laser photography system	Physiological changes in the retinal vasculature are commonly indicative of such disorders as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. Thus, various methods have been developed for noninvasive clinical evaluation of ocular hemodynamics. However, to the best of our knowledge, current ophthalmic instruments do not provide a true color blood flow imaging capability. Accordingly, we propose a new method for the true color imaging of blood flow using a high-speed pulsed laser photography system. In the proposed approach, monochromatic images of the blood flow are acquired using a system of three cameras and three color lasers (red, green, and blue). A highquality true color image of the blood flow is obtained by assembling the monochromatic images by means of image realignment and color calibration processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by imaging the flow of mouse blood within a microfluidic channel device. The experimental results confirm the proposed system provides a high-quality true color blood flow imaging capability, and therefore has potential for noninvasive clinical evaluation of ocular hemodynamics. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84904534995	Clinical and pathological correlates of severity classifications in trigger fingers based on computer-aided image analysis	Background: The treatment of trigger finger so far has heavily relied on clinicians' evaluations for the severity of patients' symptoms and the functionality of affected fingers. However, there is still a lack of pathological evidence supporting the criteria of clinical evaluations. This study's aim was to correlate clinical classification and pathological changes for trigger finger based on the tissue abnormality observed from microscopic images.Methods: Tissue samples were acquired, and microscopic images were randomly selected and then graded by three pathologists and two physicians, respectively. Moreover, the acquired images were automatically analyzed to derive two quantitative parameters, the size ratio of the abnormal tissue region and the number ratio of the abnormal nuclei, which can reflect tissue abnormality caused by trigger finger. A self-developed image analysis system was used to avoid human subjectivity during the quantification process. Finally, correlations between the quantitative image parameters, pathological grading, and clinical severity classification were assessed.Results: One-way ANOVA tests revealed significant correlations between the image quantification and pathological grading as well as between the image quantification and clinical severity classification. The Cohen's kappa coefficient test also depicted good consistency between pathological grading and clinical severity classification.Conclusions: The criteria of clinical classification were found to be highly associated with the pathological changes of affected tissues. The correlations serve as explicit evidence supporting clinicians in making a treatment strategy of trigger finger. In addition, our proposed computer-aided image analysis system was considered to be a promising and objective approach to determining trigger finger severity at the microscopic level.

84914125177	In vivo analysis of trapeziometacarpal joint arthrokinematics during multi-directional thumb motions	Methods Fifteen healthy participants were enrolled in this study. Static computed tomography images of the 1st metacarpal bone and trapezium were taken at specific thumb postures during thumb flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and circumduction motions. Images were analyzed to examine the joint gliding, expressed as displacement of the centroid of the articular surface of the 1st metacarpal bone, relative to the trapezium. The gliding ratio, defined as joint gliding in each direction normalized to the dimension of the trapezium joint surface in the given direction, was computed and compared between different thumb motions.

10444258129	Super-resolution techniques for image sequence enlargement	Conventional image interpolation is mostly performed on a single image frame, thus the image quality is greatly constrained when it is applied to enlarge a sequence of images. Super-resolution enlargement algorithm was then proposed to utilize multiple frames as the additional information to estimate the enlarged image sequence. In this paper, a complete system based on super-resolution enlargement algorithm is proposed for image sequence enlargement. This system consists of three major steps, the hierarchical block matching together with partial distortion elimination, the multilevel magnification by iterative resolution enhancement, and the robust point matching to register the center image with the still image. The proposed method achieves better magnification quality than the traditional one. Besides, it is also faster in computation. The registration by robust point-matching algorithm is also successful in combing the still image for obtaining even better magnification results.

84924338167	Virtual hand modeling for ultrasound-guided percutaneous surgical simulator	Percutaneous surgery, which accesses to inner organs via 'needle-puncture' of the skin rather than an 'open' approach, has gotten greater attention and preference in clinic. So far, using cadavers as a medium for surgeons' skill training for percutaneous release procedures remains the most common training approach, which is extremely costly in materials and untraceable in procedures. In this study we investigate a new virtual hand modeling framework for developing an ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous release simulator. Our framework first builds a finger joint model with bones, tendons, skin surface, and joint mechanism from magnetic resonance (MR) images of a human hand. Then, we design a joint-constraint registration method to fuse MR and US hand images of the same subject. Lastly, the fused image sets are warped to match the spatial configuration of a phantom hand by a thin-plate spline (TPS) warping scheme with incremental anatomical landmarks. Experiments showed that our framework incorporating anatomical and biomechanical constraints efficiently accommodated for pose and intensity variations of an articulated structure among different modality images, thus providing a promising medium of virtual MR-US image model for practicing percutaneous release surgery.
