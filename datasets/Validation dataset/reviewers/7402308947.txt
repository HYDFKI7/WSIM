8644290892	Activity of gefitinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with very poor performance status	Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with poor performance status (PS) are less likely to respond to chemotherapy, or to have an improvement in survival, but more likely to experience toxicity. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of gefitinib in patients with advanced NSCLC and very poor PS in Taiwan. Patients with stage IIIB, IV NSCLC with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 3-4 received oral gefitinib 250 mg once daily. Totally, 52 patients were included (25 men, 27 women). Forty-three patients (82.7%) were in a PS of 3. Tumor response rate was 25.0% (13/52). Tumor response rate to gefitinib was highest in chemonaive patients 38.1% (8/21) vs. failed 1 chemotherapy regimen 13.3% (2/15) vs. failed 2 or more chemotherapy regimens 18.8% (3/16), p = 0.015. The median overall survival was 2.5 months (response group 9.1 months, stable disease 3.1 months, and progressive group 0.8 month, p < 0.001). Adverse events, mainly skin reactions and diarrhea, were generally mild (grade 1 or 2) except paronychia and acne. Thus, gefitinib has clinically antitumor activity and good tolerability in {Taiwan} patients with advanced NSCLC and very poor performance status, with a higher response rate than that seen Europe or in European heritage Americans. Chemonaive patients responded better than patients with prior chemotherapy. Formal clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the role of gefitinib in this situation.

1842839901	Increased expression of cytochrome P4501B1 in peripheral leukocytes from lung cancer patients	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) and P4501B1 (CYP1B1) have been shown to metabolically activate some carcinogens. In the present study, we utilized the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to compare AhR, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA levels in peripheral leukocytes from 42 lung cancer patients and 59 non-cancer subjects. We found that CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 levels, but not AhR, were significantly higher in patients than in non-cancer subjects. After stratified by gender, CYP1A1 levels were significantly higher in female patients than in female controls. After controlling for age, smoking status and gender, lung cancer patients were more likely to be CYP1B1 high expressers (P<0.05). Neither AhR nor CYP1A1 levels was associated with lung cancer incidence. Leu-Val polymorphism of CYP1B1 was not associated with lung cancer risk in our study. These data indicated that CYP1B1 mRNA levels were elevated in peripheral leukocytes of lung cancer patients. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

21244488593	The transcriptional factor YY1 upregulates the novel invasion suppressor HLJ1 expression and inhibits cancer cell invasion	By using microarray and an invasion/metastasis lung cell line model, we identified the DnaJ-like heat shock protein 40, HLJ1, and found that the expression of HLJ1 correlates negatively with cancer cell invasion ability. Overexpression of HLJ1 can suppress cancer cell invasion in vitro. We further characterize the putative promoter region and investigate the transcriptional regulations of human HLJ1. A serial deletion of the 1.2 kb at the 5′-flanking region of the human HLJ1 gene was subcloned into a vector containing reporter gene and transfected into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line CL1-0, followed by luciferase activity assay. The results indicated that the region from -232 to +176 could drive the basal transcriptional activity of the HLJ1 gene. Sequence analysis of the HLJ1 gene promoter region showed absence of a TATA box, but identified an inverted CCAAT box and four YY1 transcriptional factor-binding sites, which may be important in the regulation of HLJ1 expression. Co-transfection of the YY1 and HLJ1 basal promoter regions, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that YY1 could upregulate HLJ1 basal promoter activity. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that overexpression of YY1 in CL1-0 cells can increase HLJ1 expression and reduce cell invasive capability. The reduction of cancer cell invasive ability is, at least in part, through upregulation of E-cadherin expression. The increase in HLJ1 and E-cadherin expression, as well as the suppression of invasion ability, can be reversed specifically by HLJ1 siRNA. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

28844483319	Induction of tubulin by Docetaxel is associated with p53 status in human non small cell lung cancer cell lines	Docetaxel (DOC), a member of the taxane family of anticancer drugs, binds to tubulin and produces unnaturally stable microtubules that induce cell death. DOC is used clinically alone or in combination with other compounds to treat advanced stages of cancer. We have treated the human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 and human cervical cancer HeLa cells with low concentrations of DOC to characterize the response of β-tubulin isotypes and p53 genes. The relationship between p53 function and DOC, acting through a microtubule-based mechanism, was examined. We found that after 18-hr treatment with DOC, β-tubulin gene transcription was enhanced in p53-null H1299 cells but not in A549 cells. Also, p53 RNA was strongly induced in the A549 cells. In addition, β-tubulin levels also increased in the H1299 cells after the DOC treatment. Further demonstrating an association of DOC treatment with p53 and β-tubulin, inhibition of p53 expression by interference RNA in A549 cells showed increasing β-tubulin gene expression with DOC treatment. We also selected a clone from the H1299 cells that stably expressed p53, examined the β-tubulin expression after DOC treatment and found an inhibition of β-tubulin induction in these p53-expressing cells. Our data suggest that the initial response of cells to DOC treatment involves p53; alternatively, in the absence of p53, tubulins may be transactivated. Selection of the DOC-resistant A549 cells showed β-tubulin expression was increased, in contrast to the initial response to the DOC treatment. From the initial and selection responses of β-tubulin in cancer cells, it appears that there is a p53-associated β-tubulin expression as a result of the DOC treatment. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

31144442999	Etiology and cytokine expression in patients requiring mechanical ventilation due to severe community-acquired pneumonia	Background: The relationship between bacterial etiology and serum cytokine levels in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without response to initial empiric treatment remains unclear. This study investigated the bacterial etiology, outcomes, and bronchoalveolar and systemic cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-8, IL-10) in these patients. Methods: This hospital-based study enrolled 47 consecutive patients without response to initial empiric treatment and requiring mechanical ventilation due to severe CAP between July 1, 2000 and October 31, 2001, in a respiratory intensive care unit of a 1200-bed teaching hospital in central Taiwan. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed within 3 days after hospitalization. BAL fluid was processed for quantitative bacterial cultures. Blood samples were taken just before BAL, and the levels of both BAL and serum cytokines were measured. Results: The most common pathogens isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%). Patients with a K. pneumoniae isolate (n = 10) had significantly higher levels of IL-1β in BAL fluid and significantly higher levels of IL-10 in serum and BAL fluid than patients with other etiologies. Non-survivors had higher levels of serum IL-8 (p = 0.001), serum IL-10 (p < 0.001) and BAL IL-10 (p = 0.039) than survivors. Marked increases in local and systemic cytokine expression (IL-8 and IL-10) were noted in rapidly fatal cases. Conclusion: P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae are the most common causes of CAP requiring mechanical ventilation in Taiwan. Cytokine patterns in the BAL fluid and serum of patients with severe CAP due to K. pneumoniae showed significant elevations compared to other pathogens. Bronchoalveolar and systemic cytokine levels (especially IL-10) predicted mortality. These findings suggest the need for a clinical trial to determine how immunomodulating therapy might affect cytokine profiles and clinical outcome. ©2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33644783506	Association of TNF-α polymorphism with susceptibility to and severity of non-small cell lung cancer	Background: Genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene are involved in the regulation of expression levels and have been associated with various inflammatory and malignant conditions. We have investigated two polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF-α gene (-308 G/A and -238 G/A) for their role in the susceptibility to and severity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), by means of an allelic association study. Methods: Using a case-control study design, lung cancer patients (n = 202) and appropriate age- and sex-matched controls recruited from the health check-up unit (n = 205) were subjected to genotype analysis for these polymorphisms, using a high-throughput allelic discrimination method. Results: Genotype was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique with genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Overall, the distribution of the genotype frequencies of TNF-α-308 A/G and -238 A/G were significantly different between the lung cancer patients and the healthy controls, and also different between patients with lung cancers of various stages (p < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that higher odds ratios (ORs) for lung cancer were seen for individuals with TNF-α-308 AA/GA genotypes against GG genotype (an OR of 3.75, 95% CI 2.38-5.92, p < 0.0001), and lower ORs were seen for individuals with TNF-α-238 AA/GA genotypes against GG genotype (an OR of 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.50, p < 0.0001). The patients carrying a homologous AA or heterologous GA genotype at TNF-308 (p = 0.017), or a homologous GG genotype at TNF-238 (p = 0.001), had a tendency to advanced disease. Conclusions: A significant association between the 308 G/A and 238 G/A polymorphisms in the promoter region of TNF-α and the susceptibility to lung cancer was demonstrated. Also, these two polymorphisms were associated with the severity of lung cancer. The -308 A allele has a promotive effect for lung cancer development and progression, whereas the -238 A allele has a protective function against lung cancers. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33745243337	A new tumor suppressor DnaJ-like heat shock protein, HLJ1, and survival of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma	Background: We previously identified DnaJ-like heat shock protein (HLJ1) as a gene associated with tumor invasion. Here, we investigated the clinical significance of HLJ1 expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its role in cancer progression. Methods: We induced HLJ1 overexpression or knockdown in human lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cells and analyzed cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, in vivo tumorigenesis, cell motility, invasion, and cell cycle progression. Expression of genes that act downstream of HLJ1 was examined by DNA microarray analysis, pathway analysis, and western blotting. We measured HLJ1 expression in tumors and adjacent normal tissues of 71 NSCLC patients by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Associations between HLJ1 expression and disease-free and overall survival were determined using the log-rank test and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Validation was performed in an independent cohort of 56 NSCLC patients. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mapping of the HLJ1 locus was analyzed in 48 paired microdissected NSCLC tumors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: HLJ1 expression inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenesis, cell motility, and invasion, and slowed cell cycle progression through a novel STAT1/P21 WAF1 pathway that is independent of P53 and interferon. HLJ1 expression was lower in tumors than in adjacent normal tissue in 55 of 71 patients studied. NSCLC patients with high HLJI expressing tumors had reduced cancer recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.23 to 0.93; P = .03) and longer overall survival (HR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.89; P = .03) than those with low-expressing tumors. Validation in the independent patient cohort confirmed the association between HLJ1 expression and patient outcome. LOH mapping revealed high frequencies (66.7% and 70.8%) of allelic loss and microsatellite instability (87.5% and 95.2%) of the HLJ1 locus at chromosome 1p31.1. Conclusions: HLJ1 is a novel tumor suppressor in NSCLC, and high HLJ1 expression is associated with reduced cancer recurrence and prolonged survival of NSCLC patients. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

33750051006	Predictive factors of gefitinib antitumor activity in East Asian advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients	BACKGROUND: Gender, smoking history, adenocarcinoma histology, performance status, and East Asian ethnicity were predictive factors of gefitinib response in previous analysis. However, these factors tend to be correlated with each other; it is not clear whether gender, smoking history, and adenocarcinoma histology were all independent predictors for response in East Asian populations. METHODS: Tumor response, survival and predictive factors of gefitinib response of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated between May of 2002 and November of 2004 were collected retrospectively from three medical centers in Taiwan. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to test potential predictive factors associated with response to gefitinib. Overall survivals between groups with different predictive factors were compared by log-rank tests. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors that independently predict for survival. RESULTS: A total of 428 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up duration for living patients was 19.5 months (range, 10.2-39.9). Objective tumor response was observed in 114 patients (26.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.4%-30.8%) and disease stabilization in 129 patients (30.2%). Response rate was statistically significant higher in adenocarcinoma, good performance status, and chemonaive patients in multivariate analysis. The median survival was 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.8-9.0) and 1-year survival was 34.3% (95% CI: 29.0%-38.0%). Significant independent predictive factors associated with longer survival in multivariate analysis were good performance status (p < 0.001) and responsiveness to gefitinib (p < 0.001). In 286 chemotherapy-treated patients, the response rate was 22.7%. Median and 1-year survival was 7.9 months and 36.7%, respectively. Good performance status was predictive of tumor response (p < 0.001) and better survival (p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. Response to gefitinib was predictive of better survival (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gender and smoking status were not, but good performance status (PS), no previous chemotherapy, and adenocarcinoma histology were independent predictive factors in multivariate analysis for gefitinib response in Taiwanese advanced non-small cell lung cancer population. In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, only good PS was an independent predictor for tumor response in multivariate analysis. © 2006International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

33750057986	Survival outcome and predictors of gefitinib antitumor activity in East Asian chemonaive patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer	BACKGROUND. Chemonaive patients had higher response rates than chemotherapy-treated patients in previous analyses of East Asian patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. The survival outcome and the predictors for antitumor activity in chemonaive patients who received gefitinib as first-line treatment are unclear. METHODS. Clinicopathologic predictive factors, objective tumor responses, and the survival of consecutive patients with advanced, chemonaive nonsmall cell lung cancer who received gefitinib as first-line treatment were collected and analyzed. Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine independent predictive factors for gefitinib antitumor efficacy. RESULTS. One hundred ninety-six patients (112 males and 84 females) were analyzed. Ninety-six patients (49%) were never smokers. One hundred forty-four patients (73%) had adenocarcinoma or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma histology. One hundred twenty patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2. Eighty-three patients (42%; 95% confidence interval, 36-49%) had an objective tumor response. An additional 35 patients had stable disease (disease control rate, 61%). The tumor response rate was 52% in patients who had a good performance status. Female gender, nonsmoking status, and adenocarcinoma histology all were independent predictors of response or disease control in multivariate analysis. The median survival was 11.1 months, and the 1-year survival rate of patients who had a good performance status was 47.5%. CONCLUSIONS. The response rate to gefitinib was high in East Asian chemonaive patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Female gender, adenocarcinoma histology, and nonsmoking status all were independent predictors of gefitinib response. The survival outcome of these patients was similar to that of patients who initially received chemotherapy. © 2006 American Cancer Society.

33750285970	Identification of α-enolase as an autoantigen in lung cancer: Its overexpression is associated with clinical outcomes	Purpose: Although existence of humoral immunity has been previously shown in malignant pleural effusions, only a limited number of immunogenic tumor-associated antigens (TAA) have been identified and associated with lung cancer. In this study, we intended to identify moreTAAs in pleural effusion - derived tumor cells. Experimental Design: Using morphologically normal lung tissues as a control lysate in Western blotting analyses, 54 tumor samples were screened with autologous effusion antibodies. Biochemical purification and mass spectrometric identification of TAAs were done using established effusion tumor cell lines as antigen sources. We identified a p48 antigen as α-enolase (ENO1). Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate expression status of ENO1 in the tissue samples of 80 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and then correlated with clinical variables. Results: Using ENO1-specifc antiserum, up-regulation of ENO1 expression in effusion tumor cells from 11 of 17 patients was clearly observed compared with human normal lung primary epithelial and non-cancer-associated effusion cells. Immunohistochemical studies consistently showed high level of ENO1 expression in all the tumors we have examined thus far. Log-rank and Cox's analyses of ENO1 expression status revealed that its expression level in primary tumors was a key factor contributing to overall- and progression-free survivals of patients (P < 0.05). The same result was also obtained in the early stage of NSCLC patients, showing that tumors expressing relatively higher ENO1 level were tightly correlated with poorer survival outcomes. Conclusions: Our data strongly support a prognostic role of ENO1 in determining tumor malignancy of patients with NSCLC. © 2006 American Association for Cancer Research.

33846011470	A five-gene signature and clinical outcome in non-small-cell lung cancer	BACKGROUND: Current staging methods are inadequate for predicting the outcome of treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We developed a five-gene signature that is closely associated with survival of patients with NSCLC. METHODS: We used computer-generated random numbers to assign 185 frozen specimens for microarray analysis, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, or both. We studied gene expression in frozen specimens of lung-cancer tissue from 125 randomly selected patients who had undergone surgical resection of NSCLC and evaluated the association between the level of expression and survival. We used risk scores and decision-tree analysis to develop a gene-expression model for the prediction of the outcome of treatment of NSCLC. For validation, we used randomly assigned specimens from 60 other patients. RESULTS: Sixteen genes that correlated with survival among patients with NSCLC were identified by analyzing microarray data and risk scores. We selected five genes (DUSP6, MMD, STAT1, ERBB3, and LCK) for RT-PCR and decision-tree analysis. The five-gene signature was an independent predictor of relapse-free and overall survival. We validated the model with data from an independent cohort of 60 patients with NSCLC and with a set of published microarray data from 86 patients with NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Our five-gene signature is closely associated with relapse-free and overall survival among patients with NSCLC. Copyright © 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society.

34447336680	Surgical results of metastatic spinal cord compression secondary to non-small cell lung cancer	STUDY DESIGN. The results for 37 surgical interventions in 31 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with symptomatic spinal cord compression were reviewed retrospectively. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate postoperative outcomes and survival rates of NSCLC patients surgically treated for symptomatic spinal metastasis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. For patients with spinal cord compression secondary to lung cancer, the prognosis is usually poor. However, with the development of new chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted therapeutic agents, the survival rate may be better. METHODS. From November 2000 to March 2005, 31 patients with symptomatic metastatic spinal cord compression secondary to NSCLC underwent palliative surgery using a posterolateral transpedicular approach (PTA) or combined posterior and anterior procedures. The indication for surgery was neurologic progression due to spinal cord compression. RESULTS. The patients ranged in age from 20 to 81 years (mean, 61.4 years). Twenty-eight patients (90%) underwent PTA, and 3 patients had combined posterior and anterior procedures. Neurologic improvement by at least one Frankel grade was noted in 25 of 31 cases (80%). Overall, 74% of patients (23 of 31) were able to walk after surgery. There was no case of intraoperative mortality, but two deaths occurred in the postoperative period. Median survival time was 8.8 months. CONCLUSIONS. Even though lung cancer is considered an aggressive tumor, it is justifiable to aggressively treat patients with symptomatic spinal cord compression. Surgery by PTA can lead to good results in these patients. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34447645694	Revisit of 1997 TNM staging system - Survival analysis of 1112 lung cancer patients in Taiwan	Background: There is neither a nation-wide nor a large-scale, multi-institutional lung cancer database available for stage-by-stage survival analysis in Taiwan at present. Methods: Using the data element provided by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the Taiwan Lung Cancer Society initiated a project to include native lung cancer patients into a global database. A total of 1112 Taiwan lung cancer patients treated in 7 medical centers were enrolled. Results: In small cell lung cancer, patients with ipsilateral pleural effusion had a survival between those with locoregional disease alone and those with distant metastasis; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.204). In non-small cell lung cancer, tumor size had significant survival influence for patients as a whole (P < 0.001) but it did not support the further division of stage IA according to tumor size (P = 0.122). The survival was compatible in stage IIIB and IV patients and therefore, the survival impact of pleural effusion cannot be determined. In patients with pIIIA-N2 disease, those who had station 8 nodal metastasis had inferior survival (P = 0.020) and station 5 superior survival (P = 0.010). In patients with distant metastasis, bone, liver, or distant lymph node metastasis predicted an inferior survival (all P values < 0.05). Conclusions: The present study provides for comparison in this area a stage-by-stage reference for the survival of lung cancer patients. Some factors other than current TNM descriptors need to be further investigated in constructing the next version of the staging system. © 2006 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.

34848844343	Local metastases along the tract of needle: A rare complication of vertebroplasty in treating spinal metastases	STUDY DESIGN. Needle tract seeding after biopsy has been reported by many authors. Since the procedure of needle insertion in vertebroplasty is the same as in biopsy, tumor metastasis along the tract of the needle in vertebroplasty should be possible. OBJECTIVE. We report local metastases along the needle tract as a rare complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty in treating spinal metastases in a lung cancer patient. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. The true incidence of tumor implantation along the needle tract may be underestimated as many patients die before the metastases become clinically significant. METHODS. A 76-year-old man diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of lung underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty at L1 and L3 vertebral levels due to painful spinal metastases. His condition worsened 3 months later, however, with recurrent back pain and weakness of both legs. RESULTS. MRI of lumbar spine performed post-percutaneous vertebroplasty revealed new contrast-enhanced lesions at the posterior aspect of L1 vertebral body with extension to the adjacent anterior epidural space of L1 and posterior epidural space along T12 to L3 levels with compression of the adjacent dural sac and additional paraspinal involvement. CONCLUSION. To our knowledge, local metastasis after vertebroplasty in treating spinal metastases has not been reported in the literature. However, this may be a potential complication of vertebroplasty in treating spinal metastases as improvement in cancer treatments occurs with subsequent longer survival times. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

35048836815	Hormone replacement therapy and lung cancer risk in Chinese	BACKGROUND. The association between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and a reduced lung cancer risk has been reported in previous studies. There is a high female to male ratio in Chinese lung cancer patients, and female patients have different clinicopathological characteristics compared with Western patient populations. The authors investigated whether HRT may reduce lung cancer risk in Taiwan. METHODS. The authors used a case-control study design to investigate 826 women with lung cancer and 531 healthy controls. Personal interviews based on a structured questionnaire were performed to collect information on HRT use of at least 3 months, age, ethnicity, active and passive smoking, exposure to air pollution, cooking or incense fumes, body mass index (BMI), menopause, and family history of cancers. RESULTS. HRT use was associated with reduced lung cancer risk with a multivariate, adjusted odds ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.94; P = .019). HRT use was associated with reduced odds ratio of lung cancer in all subset analyses stratified by histology, active and passive cigarette smoking, BMI, history of incense burning, cooking, and motorcycle riding, as well as family history of certain cancers. CONCLUSIONS. This study confirmed that HRT is associated with a reduced lung cancer risk. The results appeared to be applicable to Chinese female population groups. © 2007 American Cancer Society.

37349096992	MicroRNA Signature Predicts Survival and Relapse in Lung Cancer	We investigated whether microRNA expression profiles can predict clinical outcome of NSCLC patients. Using real-time RT-PCR, we obtained microRNA expressions in 112 NSCLC patients, which were divided into the training and testing sets. Using Cox regression and risk-score analysis, we identified a five-microRNA signature for the prediction of treatment outcome of NSCLC in the training set. This microRNA signature was validated by the testing set and an independent cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in their microRNA signatures had poor overall and disease-free survivals compared to the low-risk-score patients. This microRNA signature is an independent predictor of the cancer relapse and survival of NSCLC patients. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

58049085908	Patient awareness of prognosis, patient-family caregiver congruence on the preferred place of death, and caregiving burden of families contribute to the quality of life for terminally ill cancer patients in Taiwan	Objectives: The main goal of end-of-life care is to achieve the best quality of life (QOL) for patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of (1) the patients' awareness of their prognosis, (2) the extent of patient-family caregiver congruence on the preferences for end-of-life care options, and (3) the perceived caregiving burden of family caregivers when they provide end-of-life care to their dying relative, on the QOL for terminally ill cancer patients in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 1108 dyads of patient-family caregiver from 24 hospitals throughout Taiwan were one-time surveyed. Predictors of the QOL were identified by multiple regression analysis. Results: Controlling for the effects of age, financial status, and symptom distress, a novel finding of this study was that the patient awareness of prognosis, patient-family caregiver congruence on the preferred place of death, and the subjective family caregiving burden had a significant impact on the QOL of Taiwanese terminally ill cancer patients. Conclusions: QOL is not only related to the unavoidable decline in physical condition and daily functioning of the dying patient but is also related to domains that, as death approaches, have the potential to show improvement through the efforts of health-care professionals, such as presenting prognostic information to optimize the patients' understanding and assists them with psychological adjustments, facilitating patient-family caregiver congruence on the end-of-life care decision regarding the place of death and lightening the caregiving burden of family caregivers.

77954143562	ATM polymorphisms and risk of lung cancer among never smokers	The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, an important caretaker of overall genome stability, is thought to play a role in the development of human malignancy. Therefore, we hypothesized that sequence variants in ATM may influence the disposition to lung cancer. In this hospital-based matched case-control study, nine ATM single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs189037, rs228597, rs228592, rs664677, rs609261, rs599558, rs609429, rs227062, and rs664982) were genotyped in 730 lung cancer patients and 730 healthy controls. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium among nine polymorphisms in the ATM gene was very high. None of the main effects of any of the ATM polymorphisms were related to the risk of lung cancer. Interestingly, ATM polymorphisms were significantly associated with lung cancer among never smokers, and the association was modulated by low-level exposure to carcinogens such as environmental tobacco smoke. When the haplotypes of nine ATM polymorphism sites were studied, no overall association between ATM haplotypes and risk of lung cancer was found. However, the frequency distribution of haplotypes between lung cancer cases and controls was significant in the never smokers (P=0.009), demonstrating that haplotypes have a significant effect on the risk of lung cancer. In conclusion, we found that never smokers with sequence variants of the ATM gene may be at increased risk for lung cancer. Our data also suggest this association may be further modified by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. This study suggests support to the literature that ATM polymorphisms and environmental tobacco smoke exposure have a role in lung carcinogenesis among never smokers. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

80052691368	Clustered genomic alterations in chromosome 7p dictate outcomes and targeted treatment responses of lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR-activating mutations	Purpose: Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been proven more effective for patients with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR-activating mutation rather than wild type, the former group still includes approximately 30% nonresponders. The molecular basis of this substantial response heterogeneity is unknown. Our purpose was to seek molecular aberrations contributing to disease progression at the genome-wide level and identify the prognostic signature unique to patients with EGFR-activating mutation. Patients and Methods: We first investigated the molecular differences between tumors with EGFR-activating mutation and wild-type tumors by conducting high-density array comparative genomic hybridization on a collection of 138 adenocarcinoma tissues. We then used an independent group of 114 patients to validate the clinical relevance of copy-number alterations (CNAs) in predicting overall and disease-free survival. Finally, focusing on 23 patients with EGFR mutation receiving EGFR-TKI treatment, we investigated the association between CNAs and response to EGFR-TKIs. Results: We identified chromosome regions with differential CNAs between tumors with EGFR-activating mutation and wild-type tumors and found the aberration sites to cluster highly on chromosome 7p. A cluster of six representative chromosome 7p genes predicted overall and disease-free survival for patients with EGFR-activating mutation but not for those with wild type. Importantly, simultaneous presence of more genes with increased CNAs in this cluster correlated with less favorable response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-activating mutation. Conclusion: Our results shed light on why responses to EGFR-TKIs are heterogeneous among patients with EGFR-activating mutation. They may lead to better patient management in this population. © 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

84897058262	Cancer-associated fibroblasts regulate the plasticity of lung cancer stemness via paracrine signalling	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a promising target for treating cancer, yet how CSC plasticity is maintained in vivo is unclear and is difficult to study in vitro. Here we establish a sustainable primary culture of Oct3/4(+)/Nanog(+) lung CSCs fed with CD90(+) cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to further advance our knowledge of preserving stem cells in the tumour microenvironment. Using transcriptomics we identify the paracrine network by which CAFs enrich CSCs through de-differentiation and reacquisition of stem cell-like properties. Specifically, we find that IGF1R signalling activation in cancer cells in the presence of CAFs expressing IGF-II can induce Nanog expression and promote stemness. Moreover, this paracrine signalling predicts overall and relapse-free survival in stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. IGF-II/IGF1R signalling blockade inhibits Nanog expression and attenuates cancer stem cell features. Our data demonstrate that CAFs constitute a supporting niche for cancer stemness, and targeting this paracrine signalling may present a new therapeutic strategy for NSCLC. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

4744340416	Alteration of autoantibodies against p53 in Taiwanese lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy	Background: Correlation between p53 autoantibodies (p53 Abs) titers and the efficacy of Taiwanese lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy has never been investigated. Our present study aimed at evaluating putative possibility of using p53 Abs levels as a model system to monitor effect of chemotherapy and prognosis prediction of lung cancer. Methods: The prevalence of p53 Abs in lung cancer patients and temporal alteration of p53 Abs titers in lung cancer patients carrying p53 Abs were investigated by using ELISA and Western blot analysis. Results: p53 Abs was detected in 17 of 277 (6.14%) lung cancer patients, the positivity of p53 Abs in patients with small cell lung carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma was 4.88% and 6.36%, respectively. No significant association between p53 Abs and patients' clinical manifestations was found. Titer of p53 Abs was decreased in 6 of 17 p53 Abs-carrying patients after chemotherapy. However, the decreasing p53 Abs titers were not correlated with patients' survival or chemotherapeutic efficacy. Conclusions: The prevalence of p53 Abs in Taiwanese lung cancer is much lower than that in Caucasians. It is unlikely that p53 Abs titer could be a monitoring indicator for the chemotherapeutic efficacy or a prognosis indicator of lung cancer. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

5044240387	Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and Bcl-2 downregulation mediate apoptosis after gemcitabine treatment partly via a p53-independent pathway	Gemcitabine is a promising compound for the treatment of human lung cancer. Although apoptosis has been shown to play a role in certain cell types with gemcitabine, the steps leading to cell death after the drug-target interaction are not well understood. We studied the molecular mechanisms of gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and determined the role of p53 function on the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine in human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H1299 and H1299/p53 cells. Here, we found that gemcitabine induced an apoptotic cell death via a Bcl-2-dependent caspase-9 activation pathway. Moreover, phosphorylated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was observed upon gemcitabine treatment. Genetical or pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation markedly blocked gemcitabine-induced cell death. Furthermore, inactivation of Akt was also involved in this event. Taken together, our observations indicate that ERK activation and Akt inactivation mediated gemcitabine-induced apoptosis independently of p53 in human NSCLC H1299 cells. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

52149092350	High efficacy of erlotinib in Taiwanese NSCLC patients in an expanded access program study previously treated with chemotherapy	Purpose: Erlotinib is the first epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) which has demonstrated a survival benefit in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. An open label phase II study was conducted in Taiwanese patients with NSCLC to evaluate its efficacy. Methods: Patients with proven stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who had received at least one line of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy were enrolled into this study. All patients were given oral erlotinib, 150 mg/day till disease progression. Results: From May 2005 to July 2006, 300 patients were entered from 14 hospitals in Taiwan. This analysis was based on 299 patients who received at least one dose of erlotinib. The best response rates were a 29% partial response and 44% stable disease in 273 patients who had response data available. Non-smoking (p = 0.033), adenocarcinoma/BAC (p = 0.0027), female (p = 0.0013), aged less than 65 years (p = 0.0115), stage IV (p = 0.0492), patients with skin rash (p = 0.0216), and a higher grade of skin rash (p = 0.003) were significantly correlated with response to treatment. Skin rash was a common adverse event (any grade: 84%, Gr 3-4: 16%). The median time to disease progression was 5.6 months. Cox regression model for progression free survival showed patients most at risk of early progression were males of low performance status having squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusions: This was the largest multicenter prospective clinical study of NSCLC in Taiwan. The results demonstrated the excellent response rates, time-to-progression and overall survival of erlotinib in a large population of Taiwanese NSCLC patients who had been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

55949098667	An epidermal growth factor inhibitor, Gefitinib, induces apoptosis through a p53-dependent upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecules and downregulation of anti-apoptotic molecules in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells	A selective epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, Gefitinib, has been clinically demonstrated to be effective for certain cancer cell types including lung cancer. Our previous study indicated that Gefitinib induced Fas/caspase-dependent apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. However, the pathway relaying the signals of Gefitinib-induced cell death has not been fully elucidated. Loss of normal function of p53 facilitates the development of neoplastic lesions and possibly contributes to the development of resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, the current study was designed to examine the role of p53 in Gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Incubation of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with 25 μM Gefitinib resulted in phosphorylation and activation of p53 such as enhanced DNA binding activity, which was accompanied by the upregulation of PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and Fas, and downregulation of survivin and XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein). The Gefitinib-mediated Fas, PUMA, survivin, XIAP regulation and subsequent apoptosis were significantly inhibited in stable p53-shRNA transfectants. Similarly, H1299/p53 cells were more sensitive to Gefitinib compared to H1299 cells in clonogenic survival assay. This event was accompanied by p53 phosphorylation, as well as Fas, PUMA, survivin, and XIAP modulation. Collectively, the results support an important role of p53 in Gefitinib-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. p53 may induce apoptosis through the regulation of apoptotic (Fas and PUMA) and anti-apoptotic (XIAP and survivin) genes. Our studies not only pave a way to the understanding of pharmacological mechanisms of Gefitinib, but also implicate for the necessity to prescreen p53 expression level before clinical application of Gefitinib in human cancer therapy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

58349113424	A polymorphism in the APE1 gene promoter is associated with lung cancer risk	Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is an essential enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, which is the primary mechanism for the repair of DNA damage caused by oxidation and alkylation. We hypothesized that polymorphisms of APE1 are associated with risk for lung cancer. In the hospital-based matched case-control study, a total of 730 lung cancer cases and 730 cancer-free controls were genotyped for four APE1 haplotype-tagging polymorphisms (that is, -656T>G, 400A>G, 630T>C, and 1350T>G). Among them, the single-nucleotide polymorphism -656T>G located in the promoter region of APE1 was significantly associated with risk for lung cancer. We found that, compared with -656 TT homozygotes, the variant genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk [adjusted odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.33-0.79 for -656 TG; adjusted odds ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76 for -656 GG, respectively]. Furthermore, we found a statistically significant reduced risk of -656T>G variants among heavy smokers (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93 for -656 TG; adjusted odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.13-0.57 for -656 GG, respectively), with a significant gene-smoking interaction (P = 0.013). A similar gene-smoking interaction in the context of APE1 haplotypes was also observed. The in vitro promoter assay revealed that the -656 G allele had a significantly higher transcriptional activity than that of the -656 T allele. Together, our results suggest that polymorphisms of the APE1 gene possibly interact with smoking and may contribute to the development of lung cancer.

58449129163	Claudin-1 is a metastasis suppressor and correlates with clinical outcome in lung adenocarcinoma	Rationale: Claudin (CLDN)-1, a key component of tight junction complexes, was down-regulated in human lung adenocarcinomas. Objectives: To investigate the clinical significance of CLDN1 expression in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and its role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Methods: We examined the CLDN1 mRNA expression in tumor specimens from 64 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and protein expression by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 67 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. CLDN1 functions in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastatic colonization were studied by overexpression and knockdown of CLDN1. Affymetrix microarrays were performed to identify gene expression changes associated with CLDN1 overexpression. Measurements and Main Results: We found that low-CLDN1 mRNA expression had shorter overall survival (P = 0.027, log-rank test) in 64 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and we confirmed by immunohistochemistry that low CLDN1 expression had shorter overall survival (P = 0.024, log-rank test) in an independent cohort of 67 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Overexpression of CLDN1 inhibited cancer cell dissociation in time-lapse imaging of wound healing, and suppressed cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Knockdown CLDN1 expression increased cancer cell invasive and metastatic abilities. Affymetrix microarrays identified a panel of genes altered by CLDN1 overexpression. CLDN1 increased expressions of cancer invasion/metastasis suppressors (e.g., connective tissue growth factor [CTGF], thrombospondin 1 [THBS1], deleted in liver cancer 1 [DLC1], occludin [OCLN], zona occludens 1 [ZO-1]) and suppressed expressions of invasion/metastasis enhancers (e.g., secreted phosphoprotein 1 [SPP1], cut-like homeobox 1 [CUTL1], transforming growth factor alpha [TGF-α], solute carrier family 2 [faciliated glucose transporter] member 3 [SLC2A3], placental growth factor [PGF]), supporting a role for CLDN1 as an invasion and metastasis suppressor. Conclusions: CLDN1 is a cancer invasion/metastasis suppressor. CLDN1 is also a useful prognostic predictor and potential drug treatment target for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

67349086886	Association of an EGFR intron 1 SNP with never-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma patients	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development and progression of a variety of malignant tumors. To test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of the EGFR in modulating the lung cancer susceptibility, we conducted a matched case-control study of 730 lung cancer patients and 730 healthy controls for examining the association in Taiwanese population. Fourteen tag SNPs distributed in EGFR were selected for genotyping and one SNP 8227G>A (rs763317) located in the intron 1 of EGFR was significantly associated with lung cancer (P = 0.009). Interestingly, the increase of lung cancer risk is significantly associated with never-smoking female adenocarcinoma patients harboring 8227A allele. In never-smoking female population, ORs for 8227G>A were significantly increased in adenocarcinoma subtype (adjusted odds ratio (OR) for GA genotype = 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.75; and adjusted OR for AA genotype = 3.52, 95% CI = 1.32-9.37, respectively). The ORs in dominant or recessive genetic model were also significantly increased in female lung adenocarcinoma subtype (adjusted OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.05-1.90; and adjusted OR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.24-8.62, respectively). Haplotype analyses of 14 EGFR SNPs revealed that haplotype comprising the rare allele of 8227G>A and the common allele of the other 13 SNPs was associated with a significantly increased risk of female adenocarcinoma (OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.02-7.77). Together, our results suggest that polymorphisms or haplotypes of the EGFR play an important role in the development of lung cancer in Taiwan, particularly in never-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

67651097747	Surgical-pathologic factors affect long-term outcomes in stage IB (pT2 N0 M0) non-small cell lung cancer: A heterogeneous disease	Objectives: Our objective was to identify surgical-pathologic factors affecting prognosis in stage IB non-small cell lung cancers. Methods: Between 1997 and 2006, a cohort of 272 cases of pT2 N0 M0 stage lung cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The patients included 70 women and 202 men with a mean age of 67.0 years. The surgical resections included pneumonectomy in 4, bilobectomy or lobectomy in 217, and limited resections in another 51. The impact of surgical-pathologic characteristics on survival, including cell type, tumor differentiation, tumor size, depth of visceral pleural invasion, type of surgical resection, and extent of lymphadenectomy on patient survival, was compared accordingly. Results: Tumor types included adenocarcinoma/bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in 142, squamous cell carcinoma in 100, and others in 30. Cell differentiations were classified as well, moderately, and poorly differentiated in 23, 151, and 92 cases, respectively. The mean tumor size was 3.9 cm in diameter, and the average resected lymph node number was 14.3. Direct visceral pleural or subpleural invasions (<1 mm) were found in 134 and 42 cases, respectively. Angiolymphatic invasions were seen in 26 cases, and positive tumor margins were found in 14 cases. The overall 5-year and 10-year survivals were 59.5% and 41.3%, respectively. Good prognostic factors using univariate analysis included female gender, nonlimited resection, well-differentiated tumor, no angiolymphatic invasion, smaller size (≤3 cm), and numbers of nodes retrieved (>14 nodes). However, the Cox proportional hazard model revealed female gender, well-differentiated tumor, no pleural involvement, no angiolymphatic invasion, and more than 14 nodes retrieved as independent good prognostic factors. Conclusions: Stage IB lung cancer can be treated by standard pulmonary resection accompanied by adequate mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Owing to the heterogeneity of stage IB lung cancer and the fact that prognosis can be affected by many surgical-pathologic factors, refinement of the current TNM staging criteria may be needed. © 2009 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

69949183601	Interactive effect of cigarette smoking with human 8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) polymorphisms on the risk of lung cancer: A case-control study in Taiwan	Human 8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) plays an important role in repairing oxidative DNA damage induced by tobacco carcinogens. In this case-control study, the authors examined the interactive effect of hOGG1 gene polymorphisms and cigarette smoking on the risk of lung cancer in Taiwan. A total of 1,096 cases and 1,007 controls were enrolled from 6 medical centers in Taiwan during 2002-2004. hOGG1 Ser326Cys genetic polymorphisms were determined using the MassARRAY system (SEQUENOM, Inc., San Diego, California). Tobacco smoking history was obtained through personal interview according to a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The odds of developing lung cancer for persons with the Cys/Cys genotype versus the Ser/Ser genotype were 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74, 1.65) for never smokers, 1.45 (95% CI: 0.74, 2.83) for moderate smokers, and 3.52 (95% CI: 1.54, 8.06) for heavy smokers. The P value for interaction in the logistic model was 0.01. The increased risk associated with the Cys/Cys genotype among heavy smokers remained statistically significant for various histologic types of lung cancer, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. The authors conclude that there was a noticeable modifying effect on the association between hOGG1 genotype and lung cancer risk by cigarette smoking status.

73249132249	A four-gene signature from NCI-60 cell line for survival prediction in non-small cell lung cancer	Purpose: Metastasis is the main cause of mortality in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Genes that can discriminate the invasion ability of cancer cells may become useful candidates for clinical outcome prediction. We identify invasion-associated genes through computational and laboratorial approach that supported this idea in NSCLC. Experimental Design: We first conducted invasion assay to characterize the invasion abilities of NCI-60 lung cancer cell lines. We then systematically exploited NCI-60 microarray databases to identify invasion-associated genes that showed differential expression between the high and the low invasion cell line groups. Furthermore, using the microarray data of Duke lung cancer cohort (GSE 3141), invasion-associated genes with good survival prediction potentials were obtained. Finally, we validated the findings by conducting quantitative PCR assay on an in-house collected patient group (n = 69) and by using microarray data from two public western cohorts (n = 257 and 186). Results: The invasion-associated four-gene signature (ANKRD49, LPHN1, RABAC1, and EGLN2) had significant prediction in three validation cohorts (P = 0.0184, 0.002, and 0.017, log-rank test). Moreover, we showed that four-gene signature was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.354, 1.480, and 1.670; P = 0.028, 0.014, and 0.033), independent of other clinical covariates, such as age, gender, and stage. Conclusion: The invasion-associated four-gene signature derived from NCI-60 lung cancer cell lines had good survival prediction power for NSCLC patients. © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

76749142476	Tumor suppressor HLJ1 binds and functionally alters nucleophosmin via activating enhancer binding protein 2α complex formation	HLJ1, a member of the heat shock protein 40 chaperone family, is a newly identified tumor suppressor that has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer. However, the mechanism of HLJ1 action is presently obscure. In this study, we report that HLJ1 specifically interacts with the nuclear protein nucleophosmin (NPM1), forming a multiprotein complex that alters the nucleolar distribution and oligomerization state of NPM1. Enforced accumulation of NPM1 oligomers by overexpression in weakly invasive but high HLJ1-expressing cells induced the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and increased cellular migration, invasiveness, and colony formation. Furthermore, silencing HLJ1 accelerated NPM1 oligomerization, inhibited the activity of transcription corepressor activating enhancer binding protein 2α (AP-2α), and increased the activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and STAT3. Our findings suggest that HLJ1 switches the role of NPM1, which can act as tumor suppressor or oncogene, by modulating the oligomerization of NPM1 via HLJ1-NPM1 heterodimer formation and recruiting AP-2α to the MMP-2 promoter. ©2010 AACR.

77954451868	Anti-α-enolase autoantibodies are down-regulated in advanced cancer patients	Objective: Elevation of serum autoantibodies to a-enolase (ENO1) is often seen in inflammation diseases. However, it is unclear whether the levels of serum ENO1 autoantibodies could be affected during tumor progression. Hence, we attempted to determine the relative serum ENO1 autoantibody levels in healthy individuals and various stages of patients with lung and breast cancers. Methods: Sera were obtained from 99 normal individuals, 21 patients with non-cancerassociated diseases and 178 cancer patients, including Stage I, II and IV non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. The ENO1 autoantibody levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Compared with the healthy individuals, the levels of ENO1 autoantibodies were significantly decreased in Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and breast cancer patients. Consistently, this phenomenon was also observed in tumor-grafted mice. Using logistic regression analyses, data show that the titer status of ENO1 autoantibody level is highly associated with the late stage of lung and breast cancers when compared with those of healthy controls. In contrast, there were no statistic differences between healthy controls and early stages of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and total amounts of serum immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M levels in Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients were not significantly distinct from those of the healthy controls. Thus, the decreased ENO1 autoantibody event in malignant stage of cancer patients is not contributed by reduction in total immunoglobulin. Conclusions: Marked decrease in the basal level of serum ENO1 autoantibodies is a common malignant event of lung and breast cancers, suggesting that ENO1 autoantibody may serve as a prognostic marker to monitor the disease progression of these cancer patients. © The Author (2010).

78049419533	HLJ1 is a novel caspase-3 substrate and its expression enhances UV-induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma	Carcinogenesis is determined based on both cell proliferation and death rates. Recent studies demonstrate that heat shock proteins (HSPs) regulate apoptosis. HLJ1, a member of the DnaJ-like Hsp40 family, is a newly identified tumor suppressor protein closely related to relapse and survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, its role in apoptosis is currently unknown. In this study, NSCLC cell lines displaying varying HLJ1 expression levels were subjected to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, followed by flow cytometry. Interestingly, the percentages of apoptotic cells in the seven cell lines examined were positively correlated with HLJ1 expression. Enforcing expression of HLJ1 in low-HLJ1 expressing highly invasive cells promoted UV-induced apoptosis through enhancing JNK and caspase-3 activation in NSCLC. Additionally, UV irradiation led to reduced levels of HLJ1 predominantly in apoptotic cells. The pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk and caspase-3-specific inhibitor, DEVD-fmk, prevented UV-induced degradation of HLJ1 by the late stage of apoptosis. Further experiments revealed a non-typical caspase-3 cleavage site (MEID) at amino acid 125-128 of HLJ1. Our results collectively suggest that HLJ1 is a novel substrate of caspase-3 during the UV-induced apoptotic process. © The Author(s) 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

79651474615	Aurora-A promotes gefitinib resistance via a NF-κB signaling pathway in p53 knockdown lung cancer cells	Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common mutations found in human tumors. There is increasing evidence that suggests that p53 status is a determinant of chemosensitivity of tumor cells. We have previously demonstrated that p53 is a crucial regulator in mediating gefitinib-induced cell death, which upregulates apoptosis-related molecules. However, the mechanism of p53 involvement in cellular resistance to gefitinib remains unclear. In this study, we found that human non-small cell lung cancer cells, A549, with wild-type p53 exhibited a low level of Aurora-A expression and were sensitive to treatment with gefitinib. p53-knockdown A549 cells exhibited a high level of Aurora-A expression and were resistant to gefitinib-mediated apoptosis induction. In addition, the silencing of Aurora-A expression using an Aurora-A specific siRNA in p53-knockdown cells sensitized the A549 cancer cells to gefitinib-mediated apoptosis, suggesting a role for Aurora-A in gefitinib resistance. The activation of Aurora-A was accompanied by destabilization of IκBα and an increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity and was correlated with gefitinib resistance. Conversely, knockdown of Aurora-A with a siRNA stabilized IκB protein suppressed NF-κB activation and reduced gefitinib resistance. Additionally, ectopic expression of an active form of Aurora-A increased the degradation of IκB, the activation of NF-κB and the enhancement of gefitinib resistance in comparison with parental cells. These results suggest that Aurora-A is potentially involved in promoting gefitinib resistance via the activation of NF-κB pathway. Our findings also suggest that p53 not only stimulates apoptosis-related event but also inhibits the drug-resistance ability of Aurora-A, and consequently promotes the gefitinib-induced cellular apoptotic process. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79955482586	Polymorphisms of MLH1 and MSH2 genes and the risk of lung cancer among never smokers	Mismatch repair (MMR) plays an important role in repairing nucleotide mismatches during DNA replication. Defects in MMR genes are associated with some sporadic tumors. MLH1 and MSH2 are two of the MMR genes. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the associations between the risk of lung cancer and genetic polymorphisms in the MLH1 and MSH2 genes. The SNP genotypes were determined in 730 lung cancer patients and 730 healthy controls that were frequency matched for the age, gender, and smoking status. Among the SNP polymorphisms, -93A>G (rs1800734), which is located in the promoter region of MLH1, was significantly associated with the risk of lung cancer. The GG genotype for MLH1 -93A>G was associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer compared with the AA genotype among the never-smoking group (adjusted OR. = 1.64, 95% CI. = 1.10-2.44; P = 0.013). Consistently, the haplotype of MLH1 with one -93G risk allele was associated with the risk of lung cancer compared with the AA haplotype among the never-smoking group. Furthermore, the risk of MLH1 -93A>G polymorphism in the never-smoking group related to lung adenocarcinoma was modulated by environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure status, with a significant gene-ETS interaction (P = 0.042). No evidence was found of the association between MSH2 and the lung cancer risk. In conclusion, our data suggest that the MLH1 -93A>G polymorphism may contribute to the etiology of lung cancer, particularly in never smokers. This study also suggests that MLH1 -93A>G polymorphisms and ETS exposure have a role in the tumorigenesis of lung adenocarcinoma among never smokers. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79956091519	Comparative effectiveness of bevacizumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment in East Asian non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients applying real-life outcomes	Aim: To indirectly compare real-life clinical effectiveness of bevacizumab + cisplatin-based therapy from the Safety of Avastin in Lung (SAiL) phase IV clinical trial with published evidence from the phase III clinical trial for pemetrexed + cisplatin among East Asian patients with non-squamous metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Survival outcomes were compared between subgroups of East Asian patients receiving treatments of either bevacizumab + cisplatin-based chemotherapy or pemetrexed + cisplatin using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison approach. Patient-level data were used to derive a new group with similar characteristics compared to those reported in a phase III clinical trial evaluating pemetrexed + cisplatin therapy. Exclusions to the SAiL data included those with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2, those with mixed cell histology, non-East Asians and those who did not receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In total 1000 samples of the pre-matched analysis set of the SAiL data were selected that resulted in equal distributions of the ECOG PS and gender matching variables selected and evaluated for a progression-free survival (PFS) outcome. Results: Median PFS was longer for patients treated with bevacizumab-based therapy (7.4months; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.7-8.2) versus pemetrexed + cisplatin (6.4months; 95% CI N/A) among non-squamous East Asian NSCLC patients. Conclusion: The results suggest that East Asian non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with bevacizumab-based therapy have a trend toward improved PFS outcomes compared to those treated with pemetrexed + cisplatin, even after adjusting for differences between the two trial groups. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

79958113115	Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status in stage i lung adenocarcinoma with different image patterns	Purpose: Early lung adenocarcinoma may present with ground-glass opacity (GGO) component in computed tomography (CT) scan. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation had been reported in patients with lung cancer with GGO patterns. Nevertheless, the correlation between clinical characteristics, CT image patterns, and EGFR mutation status was indeterminate. Methods: Patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma with tumor lesions less than 3 cm were included and classified into pure GGO, part-solid, and solid patterns by CT scan images. All patients had EGFR mutation test from frozen tumors. Available paraffin-embedded archival tissues were microdissected into three different locations similar to CT images with central and peripheral parts of tumor, and adjacent normal part for EGFR mutation tests. Results: Totally, 162 patients were analyzed, 90 women and 72 men, and 128 nonsmokers. The patients included 35 (21.6%) pure GGO, 41 (25.3%) part-solid, and 86 (53.1%) solid lesions. The EGFR mutation rate was 64.2% (n = 104). Analysis of the correlation between CT image patterns and EGFR mutation, the less GGO ratio had more typical mutation, especially L858R (p = 0.037). In 45 microdissected tumors, the central and peripheral parts had the same EGFR mutation status. In adjacent normal parts, 5 of 32 (15.6%) EGFR mutant patients had identical mutation but none in nonmutant patients. Conclusions: In stage I lung adenocarcinoma, typical mutation, especially L858R was detected more frequent in invasive solid pattern and significantly less in pure GGO pattern. EGFR mutation is an early event in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma and may facilitate the tumor into aggressive behavior.

79959287068	Sustained activation of ERK and Cdk2/cyclin-A signaling pathway by pemetrexed leading to S-phase arrest and apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells	Pemetrexed, a multitargeted antifolate with the ability to inhibit several enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine syntheses, has demonstrated clinical activity in non-small cell lung cancer cells, as well as in a broad array of other solid tumors. In this study, we show that inducing cell cycle S-phase arrest and apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with pemetrexed is associated with increased cyclin-A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) protein and Cdk2/cyclin-A kinase activity. Knockdown of cyclin-A using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and inhibiting Cdk2 activity with flavopiridol, strikingly reduced S-phase arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, pemetrexed induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2). Knockdown of ERK1/2 using specific siRNA, as well as known inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126), effectively suppressed the expression of cyclin-A and Cdk2, and reduced S-phase arrest and apoptosis induced by pemetrexed. These data provide the first evidence that pemetrexed-induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis is associated with an increase in Cdk2 and cyclin-A expression and activation, which is ERK-dependent and upstream of caspase-3. Our findings suggest that the ERK-mediated Cdk2/cyclin-A signaling pathway is an important regulator of pemetrexed-induced S-phase arrest and apoptotic cell death. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79958164295	Safety and efficacy of first-line bevacizumab with chemotherapy in asian patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC: Results from the phase IV MO19390 (SAiL) study	Introduction: First-line treatment with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with advanced, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSNSCLC) in phase III clinical trials. SAiL (MO19390), an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of first-line bevacizumab-based treatment in clinical practice. This report presents the results of a preplanned subanalysis of Asian patients enrolled in SAiL. Methods: Patients with untreated, locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent NSNSCLC received bevacizumab 7.5 or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus chemotherapy for up to six cycles, followed by single-agent bevacizumab until disease progression. Eligibility criteria for SAiL permitted enrolment of a broad patient population. The primary end point was safety; secondary end points included time to disease progression and overall survival. Results: The Asian intent-to-treat population comprised 314 of the 2212 patients enrolled in the SAiL trial. In the Asian subanalysis, patients received a median of nine cycles of bevacizumab, and the median follow-up was 16.4 months. The incidence of clinically significant adverse events (grade ≥3) of special interest was relatively low in this population (15.6% overall); proteinuria (7.6%), hypertension (4.8%), and bleeding (2.5%) were the most common. A total of five adverse events related to bevacizumab were reported as grade 5. Disease control rate was 94.1%, median time to disease progression was 8.3 months, and median overall survival was 18.9 months. Conclusions: The safety and efficacy of first-line bevacizumab-based treatment in Asian patients with advanced NSNSCLC is consistent with that demonstrated in phase III studies and in the overall SAiL population. There were no new safety signals. Copyright © 2011 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

80051746642	Curcumin induces EGFR degradation in lung adenocarcinoma and modulates p38 activation in intestine: The versatile adjuvant for gefitinib therapy	Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with L858R or exon 19 deletion mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have good responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib. However, patients with wild-type EGFR and acquired mutation in EGFR T790M are resistant to gefitinib treatment. Here, we showed that curcumin can improve the efficiency of gefitinib in the resistant NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo models. Methods/Principal Findings: After screening 598 herbal and natural compounds, we found curcumin could inhibit cell proliferation in different gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines; concentration-dependently down-regulate EGFR phosphorylation through promoting EGFR degradation in NSCLC cell lines with wild-type EGFR or T790M EGFR. In addition, the anti-tumor activity of gefitinib was potentiated via curcumin through blocking EGFR activation and inducing apoptosis in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines; also the combined treatment with curcumin and gefitinib exhibited significant inhibition in the CL1-5, A549 and H1975 xenografts tumor growth in SCID mice through reducing EGFR, c-MET, cyclin D1 expression, and inducing apoptosis activation through caspases-8, 9 and PARP. Interestingly, we observed that the combined treatment group represented better survival rate and less intestinal mucosal damage compare to gefitinib-alone therapy. We showed that curcumin attenuated the gefitinib-induced cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis through altering p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in intestinal epithelia cell. Conclusions/Significance: Curcumin potentiates antitumor activity of gefitinib in cell lines and xenograft mice model of NSCLC through inhibition of proliferation, EGFR phosphorylation, and induction EGFR ubiquitination and apoptosis. In addition, curcumin attenuates gefitinib-induced gastrointestinal adverse effects via altering p38 activation. These findings provide a novel treatment strategy that curcumin as an adjuvant to increase the spectrum of the usage of gefitinib and overcome the gefitinib inefficiency in NSCLC patients. © 2011 Lee et al.

80053023140	Clinical and testing protocols for the analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in East Asian patients with non-small cell lung cancer: A combined clinical-molecular pathological approach	Background: Several randomized phase III studies in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) confirmed the superior response rate and progression-free survival of using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor as first-line therapy compared with chemotherapy in patients with activating EGFR mutations. Despite the need for EGFR mutation tests to guide first-line therapy in East Asian NSCLC, there are no current standard clinical and testing protocols. Methods: A consensus meeting was held involving expert oncologists, pulmonologists, and pathologists to discuss the current status and variations in EGFR mutation testing of NSCLC across Asia and to recommend a standard clinical and laboratory testing approach for future use. Results: Currently, EGFR mutation tests are only routinely performed in some East Asian countries and medical centers. The consensus recommendation was to perform the test in all newly diagnosed patients with advanced stage nonsquamous lung cancer and some squamous patients with clinical features associated with higher prevalence of EGFR mutations. To increase the sensitivity and specificity of the EGFR mutation tests, tissue acquisition and pretest sample evaluation are important steps in addition to standardization of the EGFR mutation test methodology. Conclusion: A standardized EGFR mutation testing protocol is an essential step toward realization of personalized medicine in East Asian NSCLC treatment. © 2011 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

80052778731	Terpinen-4-ol induces apoptosis in human nonsmall cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo	Terpinen-4-ol, a monoterpene component of the essential oils of several aromatic plants, exhibits antitumor effects. In this study, the antitumor effects of terpinen-4-ol and the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for it were evaluated and studied, respectively on human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Our results indicated that terpinen-4-ol elicited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, as determined by MTT assay. Increased sub-G1 population and annexin-V binding, activation of caspases 9 and 3, cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) indicated involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in terpinen-4-ol-treated A549 and CL1-0 cells. Elevation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and a decrease in IAP family proteins XIAP and survivin were also observed following terpinen-4-ol treatment. Notably, terpinen-4-ol was able to increase p53 levels in A549 and CL1-0 cells. Diminution of p53 by RNA interference induced necrosis instead of apoptosis in A549 cells following terpinen-4-ol treatment, indicating that terpinen-4-ol-elicited apoptosis is p53-dependent. Moreover, intratumoral administration of terpinen-4-ol significantly suppressed the growth of s.c. A549 xenografts by inducing apoptosis, as confirmed by TUNEL assay. Collectively, these data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying terpinen-4-ol-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells, rendering this compound a potential anticancer drug for NSCLC.

84861333516	Genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 Arg399Gln is associated with survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gemcitabine/platinum	Introduction: Elevated DNA-repair capacity has been related to chemoresistance of platinum doublet chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms of DN-repair genes excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1), ERCC2, x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1), XRCC3, and RRM1 associate with treatment outcome in NSCLC patients receiving gemcitabine plus platinum as their first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: Genotyping for eight polymorphisms in five DNA-repair genes was performed with the GenomeLab nucleotide polymorphismstream Genotyping System in 62 advanced NSCLC patients in a training set and 45 patients in a validation set treated with gemcitabine/platinum. RESULTS: In the training set, the wild-type genotype of XRCC1 Arg399Gln (G/G) was associated with decreased median overall survival (OS) (22 months, 95% confidence interval [CI], 10-34 months versus not reached, log-rank test, p = 0.005) than those carrying variant genotypes (G/A+A/A). In addition, there was a statistically significant longer median OS in patients carrying wild-type ERCC2 Asp312Asn genotype (G/G) (51 months, 95% CI, 19-82 months versus 10 months, log-rank test, p < 0.001) than those carrying heterozygous variant genotypes (G/A). In the multivariate Cox model, we found a significant effect of XRCC1 Arg399Gln (G/A+A/A versus G/G, hazard ratio [HR] 0.290; 95%CI, 0.12-0.705, p = 0.006) and ERCC2 Asp312Asn (G/A versus G/G, HR 14.04; 95% CI, 2.253-87.513, p = 0.005) polymorphisms on patients' OS. In the validation set, only XRCC1 399 CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 Arg399Gln may be a candidate for contributing interindividual difference in the OS of gemcitabine/platinum- treated advanced NSCLC patients.

84862819699	Afatinib for patients with lung adenocarcinoma and epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (LUX-Lung 2): A phase 2 trial	Background: Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB-family blocker with preclinical activity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the efficacy of afatinib in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations. Methods: In this phase 2 study, we enrolled patients from 30 centres in Taiwan and the USA with lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIb with pleural effusion or stage IV) with EGFR mutations, who had no more than one previous chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and no previous treatment with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We tested two afatinib starting doses: 50 mg daily and subsequently 40 mg daily, introduced to establish whether tolerability could be improved with retention of anti-tumour activity. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a confirmed objective response (complete response or partial response), on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 (independent review). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00525148. Findings: 129 patients were treated with afatinib, 99 with a starting dose of 50 mg and 30 with a starting dose of 40 mg. 79 (61%) of 129 patients had an objective response (two complete responses, 77 partial responses). 70 (66%) of the 106 patients with the two common activating EGFR mutations (deletion 19 or L858R) had an objective response, as did nine (39%) of 23 patients with less common mutations. Similar proportions of patients had an objective response when analysed by starting dose (18 [60%] of 30 patients at 40 mg vs 61 [62%] of 99 patients at 50 mg). Of the two most common adverse events (diarrhoea and rash or acne), grade 3 events were more common in patients receiving a 50 mg starting dose (22 [22%] of 99 patients for diarrhoea and 28 [28%] of 99 patients for rash or acne) than they were in those receiving a 40 mg starting dose (two [7%] of 30 patients for both diarrhoea and rash or acne); possibly treatment-related serious adverse events were also less common in patients receiving a 40 mg starting dose (two of 30 patients vs 14 of 99 patients). We recorded one possibly drug-related death (interstitial lung disease). Interpretation: Afatinib shows activity in the treatment of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations, especially in patients with deletion 19 or L858R mutations. The efficacy of afatinib 40 mg should be compared with chemotherapy or other EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC. Funding: Boehringer Ingelheim Inc. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862778728	Retrospective study of erlotinib in patients with advanced squamous lung cancer	Background: The effective targeted therapy for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is needed. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation rate is low in lung SCC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the status of erlotinib treatment and EGFR mutation in lung SCC patients. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled lung cancer patients with SCC histology and history of erlotinib treatment. The primary objective was to assess overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) and the secondary objective was to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). EGFR mutations were assessed in parts of patients using both direct sequencing and protein nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PNA-LNA PCR) clamp methods. Results: In total, 92 patients were analyzed (75 men and 17 women, median age 69 years, and 74 current or former smokers). Sixteen patients achieved partial response and 9 had stable disease. The ORR was 17.4% and the DCR was 27.2%. The PFS and OS were longer in patients with disease control than with progressive disease (PFS 7.8 versus 1.3 months and OS 20.7 versus 2.7 months, both p< 0.0001). The 1-year survival rate was 21.7%. In 27 patients with adequate specimens for molecular analysis (including 4 PR and 4 SD), two (7.4%) had EGFR complex mutations. One patient experienced response to erlotinib and the other did not. Conclusions: A significant proportion of lung SCC patients would derive a clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment. The relatively higher response rate than the EGFR mutation rate in present study needs further evaluation. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84863011443	Pretreatment Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation predicts shorter EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor response duration in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer	Purpose: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations have excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but T790M mutation accounts for most TKI drug resistance. This study used highly sensitive methods to detect T790M before and after TKI therapy and investigated the association of T790M and its mutation frequencies with clinical outcome. Patients and Methods: Direct sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to assess T790M in the following two cohorts of patients with NSCLC: TKI-naive patients (n = 107) and TKI-treated patients (n = 85). Results were correlated with TKI treatment response and survival. Results: MALDI-TOF MS was highly sensitive in detecting and quantifying the frequency of EGFR-activating mutations and T790M (detection limits, 0.4% to 2.2%). MALDI-TOF MS identified more T790M than direct sequencing in TKI-naive patients with NSCLC (27 of 107 patients, 25.2% v three of 107 patients, 2.8%, respectively; P < .001) and in TKI-treated patients (before TKI: 23 of 73 patients, 31.5% v two of 73 patients, 2.7%, respectively; P < .001; and after TKI: 10 of 12 patients, 83.3% v four of 12 patients, 33.3%, respectively; P = .0143). The EGFR mutations and their frequencies were confirmed by NGS. T790M was an independent predictor of decreased progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with NSCLC who received TKI treatment (P < .05, multivariate Cox regression). Conclusion: T790M may not be a rare event before or after TKI therapy in patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. The pretreatment T790M mutation was associated with shorter PFS with EGFR TKI therapy in patients with NSCLC. © 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Design: A cross-sectional and clinical investigation. Setting: Medical/surgical and respiratory intensive care unit of a tertiary 1,200-bed medical center. Patients: According to the time course of community-acquired pneumonia at the time of study with bronchoalveolar lavage, 69 mechanically ventilated patients were divided into three subgroups: primary (n = 11), referral (n = 23), and treated (n = 35) community-acquired pneumonia. Interventions: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the most abnormal area on chest radiograph by fiberoptic bronchoscope. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was processed for quantitative bacterial culture. The concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10) also were measured.

84869505068	EGFR exon 19 in-frame deletion and polymorphisms of DNA repair genes in never-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma patients	We explored potential associations between genetic polymorphisms in genes related to DNA repair and detoxification metabolism and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in a cohort of 410 never-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of EGFR mutation status in association with the genotypes of DNA repair and detoxification metabolism genes were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. We found an association between in-frame deletion in EGFR exon 19 and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1800566C/T located in NQO1 (aOR, 2.2 with 95% CI, 1.0-4.8) in female never-smokers. The SNP rs744154C/G in ERCC4 was also associated with the EGFR exon 19 in-frame deletion both in never-smokers (aOR, 1.7 with 95% CI, 1.0-3.0) and female never-smokers (aOR, 1.9 with 95% CI, 1.0-3.6). Although the association was marginally significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis, the A/A genotype of rs1047840 in EXO1 was associated with a 7.6-fold increase in the occurrence of the EGFR exon 19 in-frame deletion in female never-smokers. Moreover, risk alleles in NQO1, ERCC4 and EXO1 were associated with an increasing aOR of the EGFR exon 19 in-frame deletion both in never-smokers (p = 0.007 for trend) and female never-smokers (p = 0.002 for trend). Our findings suggest that the in-frame deletion in EGFR exon 19 is associated with polymorphisms in DNA repair and detoxification metabolism genes in never-smoking lung adenocarcinoma patients, especially in females.

84870502715	Genome-wide association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci in never-smoking women in Asia	To identify common genetic variants that contribute to lung cancer susceptibility, we conducted a multistage genome-wide association study of lung cancer in Asian women who never smoked. We scanned 5,510 never-smoking female lung cancer cases and 4,544 controls drawn from 14 studies from mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. We genotyped the most promising variants (associated at P < 5 × 10-6) in an additional 1,099 cases and 2,913 controls. We identified three new susceptibility loci at 10q25.2 (rs7086803, P = 3.54 × 10-18), 6q22.2 (rs9387478, P = 4.14 × 10-10) and 6p21.32 (rs2395185, P = 9.51 × 10-9). We also confirmed associations reported for loci at 5p15.33 and 3q28 and a recently reported finding at 17q24.3. We observed no evidence of association for lung cancer at 15q25 in never-smoking women in Asia, providing strong evidence that this locus is not associated with lung cancer independent of smoking. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

84874109197	Circulating interleukin-6 level is a prognostic marker for survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide as well as in Taiwan. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine and has been implicated in tumor progression. This study recruited 245 patients with advanced (Stage 3B/4) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had received chemotherapy, to evaluate associations between IL-6 and lung cancer-specific survival. Among these subjects, 112 gave blood samples before and 133 after the start of chemotherapy. Plasma IL-6 was measured using an enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay. The 33rd and 66th percentiles of IL-6 concentrations were 2.01 and 25.16 for the 245 patients and were defined as the cutoff points for dividing the patients into low, intermediate and high groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazard models were used to evaluate the relationship between the IL-6 level and survival time. Results after adjusting for age, sex, smoking history, histologic type and stage of lung cancer revealed a significant relationship. For all patients, the hazard ratio with high IL-6 levels for lung cancer-specific survival was 2.10 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.49-2.96] compared with low IL-6 levels. The hazard ratio for patients who were recruited before and after the start of chemotherapy was1.25 (95% CI = 0.73-2.13) and 3.66 (95% CI = 2.18-6.15), respectively. Patients with high circulating IL-6 also responded poorly to chemotherapy. Therefore, a high level of circulating IL-6 was associated with an inferior response and survival outcome in NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy. What's new? IL-6 has been implicated in the development of drug resistance in tumors. In this study, the authors found that plasma levels of IL-6 from samples collected after chemotherapy provide a more accurate prediction of survival for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer than samples collected before chemotherapy. In addition, patients with high plasma levels of IL-6 responded poorly to chemotherapy. Therefore, a high circulating IL-6 level is an independent prognostic marker for lung cancer-specific survival, especially for patients who have received chemotherapy. Copyright © 2012 UICC.

84874759837	EGFR polymorphisms, hormone replacement therapy and lung adenocarcinoma risk: Analysis from a genome-wide association study in never-smoking women	Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported as risk factors for lung cancer in never smokers. We investigate the interaction of EGFR SNPs and HRT for lung adenocarcinoma risk in never-smoking women. This study included 532 never-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma patients and 532 controls, with EGFR SNPs retrieved from a genome-wide association study. The associations of EGFR SNPs with the lung adenocarcinoma risk were estimated by multivariate-adjusted logistic regression. The Haploview program was used to select tagged EGFR SNPs interacted with HRT and construct haplotype blocks. The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to reduce the multiple testing effects. Among 84 EGFR SNPs retrieved, 11 tagging EGFR SNPs showed an interaction with HRT and lung adenocarcinoma risk, which were mostly located near the tyrosine kinase domain. Eight of the tagged SNPs were in two haplotype blocks. The interactions between HRT and numbers of protective EGFR SNP genotypes are significant in both blocks (P for interaction = 0.0004 and 0.0032, respectively). A trend of decrease in lung adenocarcinoma risk was found in subjects with HRT harboring an increasing number of protective EGFR SNP genotypes in both blocks (P = 0.0032 and 0.0046, respectively). In conclusion, HRT use may modify the association of EGFR SNPs with lung adenocarcinoma risk. The EGFR SNPs have a cumulative effect on decreasing lung adenocarcinoma risk in never-smoking women with HRT use. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

84876551334	The Motor Protein KIF14 Inhibits Tumor Growth and Cancer Metastasis in Lung Adenocarcinoma	The motor protein kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are involved in cancer progression. The depletion of one of the KIFs, KIF14, might delay the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, resulting in a binucleated status, which enhances tumor progression; however, the exact correlation between KIF14 and cancer progression remains ambiguous. In this study, using loss of heterozygosity and array comparative genomic hybridization analyses, we observed a 30% loss in the regions surrounding KIF14 on chromosome 1q in lung adenocarcinomas. In addition, the protein expression levels of KIF14 in 122 lung adenocarcinomas also indicated that approximately 30% of adenocarcinomas showed KIF14 down-regulation compared with the expression in the bronchial epithelial cells of adjacent normal counterparts. In addition, the reduced expression of KIF14 mRNA or proteins was correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.0158 and <0.0001, respectively), and the protein levels were also inversely correlated with metastasis (P<0.0001). The overexpression of KIF14 in lung adenocarcinoma cells inhibited anchorage-independent growth in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. The overexpression and silencing of KIF14 also inhibited or enhanced cancer cell migration, invasion and adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and collagen IV. Furthermore, we detected the adhesion molecules cadherin 11 (CDH11) and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) as cargo on KIF14. The overexpression and silencing of KIF14 enhanced or reduced the recruitment of CDH11 in the membrane fraction, suggesting that KIF14 might act through recruiting adhesion molecules to the cell membrane and modulating cell adhesive, migratory and invasive properties. Thus, KIF14 might inhibit tumor growth and cancer metastasis in lung adenocarcinomas. © 2013 Hung et al.

84878862492	Risk factors for primary lung cancer among never smokers by gender in a matched case-control study	Objective: Lung cancers that occur in never smokers differ from those that occur in smokers. We performed an analysis of potential epidemiological risk factors for lung cancer among never smokers. Methods: In this hospital-based matched case-control study, all 1,540 matched case-control pairs were Han Chinese in Taiwan. The data on demographic characteristics, smoking habit, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, medical history of lung diseases, family history of lung cancer, and female characteristics were collected from a structured questionnaire. A multiple conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals after adjusting for possible confounders. Results: Overall, several epidemiological factors of lung cancer in never smokers were different between males and females. For the female population, subjects who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (OR = 1.39, 95 % CI = 1.17-1.67) with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and with family history of lung cancer in first-degree relatives (OR = 2.44, 95 % CI = 1.79-3.32) had higher risk of lung cancer, while subjects with a history of hormone replacement therapy and using fume extractors for those who cooked were protective. For the male population, only subjects with family history of lung cancer in first-degree relatives (OR = 2.77, 95 % CI = 1.53-5.01) were significantly associated with risk of lung cancer. Conclusion: This study provides insights about the epidemiological factors of lung cancer in never smokers, adding to existing evidence that family history of lung cancer and environmental tobacco smoke may moderate lung cancer risk. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

We then conducted a two-pronged validation of the top 25 variants that included additional validation in 1,256 patients with NSCLC from Taiwan and assessment of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and differential expression of genes surrounding the top loci in 70 tumors and matched normal tissues. A total of 94 loci were significant for overall survival in both MD Anderson and Mayo studies in the consistency meta-analysis phase, with the top 25 variants reaching a P value of 10

84880429753	Surface α-Enolase Promotes Extracellular Matrix Degradation and Tumor Metastasis and Represents a New Therapeutic Target	In previous research, we found α-enolase to be inversely correlated with progression-free and overall survival in lung cancer patients and detected α-enolase on the surface of lung cancer cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that surface α-enolase has a significant role in cancer metastasis and tested this hypothesis in the current study. We found that α-enolase was co-immunoprecipitated with urokinase-type plasminogen activator, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, and plasminogen in lung cancer cells and interacted with these proteins in a cell-free dot blotting assay, which can be interrupted by α-enolase-specific antibody. α-Enolase in lung cancer cells co-localized with these proteins and was present at the site of pericellular degradation of extracellular matrix components. Treatment with antibody against α-enolase in vitro suppressed cell-associated plasminogen and matrix metalloproteinase activation, collagen and gelatin degradation, and cell invasion. Examination of the effect of treatment with shRNA plasmids revealed that down regulation of α-enolase decreases extracellular matrix degradation by and the invasion capacity of lung cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of α-enolase-specific antibody to mice resulted in accumulation of antibody in subcutaneous tumor and inhibited the formation of tumor metastasis in lung and bone. This study demonstrated that surface α-enolase promotes extracellular matrix degradation and invasion of cancer cells and that targeting surface α-enolase is a promising approach to suppress tumor metastasis. © 2013 Hsiao et al.

0042914542	Serial-measured versus estimated creatinine clearance in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy	Background and Purpose: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy id the main therapy for patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The dose of cisplatin is adjusted according to the patient's renal function. Calculation of creatinine clearance (CCr) by 24-hour urine collection is the most common method for estimating the glomerular filtration rate but is time-consuming and inconvenient. Estimation of CCr using the Cockcroft-Gault formula has been suggested to be accurate, reproducible, and less costly. This study compared CCr values obtained by measured and estimated methods during cisplatin-based chemotherapy in NSCLC patients in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 92 patients (58 men, 34 women) with advanced NSCLC who completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy participated in the study. The dose of cisplatin per cycle was 80 mg/m

0142168033	Successful treatment of multifocal bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma with ZD1839 (Iressa) in two patients	Multifocal borchioloalveolar cell carcinoma (BAC) is a rare condition that often presents as a bilateral lung infiltrates unsuitable for surgical and radiological treatment, with poor response to conventional chemotherapies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways are closely related to the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. ZD1839 (Iressa) is a quinazoline-derived, orally active, selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase that shows promising effects in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. We report 2 cases of multifocal BAC successfully treated with ZD1839. Both patients had advanced disease, and had productive cough for more than 1 year. After the diagnosis of BAC, the first patient received chemotherapy, but was unresponsive. Within 2 weeks of starting treatment with ZD1839 250 mg per day, the amount of bronchorrhea decreased. Two months after the start of ZD1839 treatment, image study showed a marked decrease of lung infiltrates. The second patient developed respiratory failure after an operation on the spine. He received ZD1839 250 mg daily via nasogastric tube. Two weeks after the start of treatment. his dyspnea had improved and he was weaned from the mechanical ventilator. The side effects of ZD1839 treatment in these 2 patients consisted only of dry skin and acne over the face, trunk, and periungual areas. Although the precise mechanisms of the antitumor effects of ZD1839 remain unclear, these results suggest a role for the agent in the management of patients with advanced multifocal BAC.

84891322455	The relevance between nutritional intervention on cancer patients' nutritional status and their continual process of accepting anti-cancer treatment	Due to the effects of cancer at various stages and harsh treatment processes, cancer patients often have low nutrient and dietary intake, which easily causes malnutrition. Relevant research indicated that the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) can be a tool for early screening and assessing the nutritional status of cancer patients. This study examined 179 cancer patients who accepted chemotherapy in a medical center's chemotherapy room in Taichung. These cancer patients were given nutritional interventions, including nutritional assessment and dietary guidance for those who accepted anticancer treatment for the first time and regular follow-up and problem-solving by a dietitian for those who were at high risk of malnutrition due to body weight loss and factors reducing dietary intake. For those cancer patients who had oral intake problems, the dietitian provided education about enteral nutrition through an intestinal route, and about formula preparation and proper consumption through tube feeding in order to improve their nutritional status. The study found that those cancer patients had significant increases in carbohydrate, fat, protein, and calorie intake through the nutritional intervention and education. When the relevance between nutritional intake and nutritional indicators was further examined, it was found that carbohydrate, fat, protein, and calorie intake were highly positive correlated with body weight. It was also found that carbohydrate and calorie intake were significantly correlated with hemoglobin. In conclusion, cancer patients can improve their nutritional intake through nutritional interventions, which further improves nutritional indicators.

84901365244	Pemetrexed induces S-phase arrest and apoptosis via a deregulated activation of Akt signaling pathway	Pemetrexed is approved for first-line and maintenance treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B is a well-known regulator of cell survival which is activated by pemetrexed, but its role in pemetrexed-mediated cell death and its molecular mechanisms are unclear. This study showed that stimulation with pemetrexed induced S-phase arrest and cell apoptosis and a parallel increase in sustained Akt phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation in the NSCLC A549 cell line. Inhibition of Akt expression by Akt specific siRNA blocked S-phase arrest and protected cells from apoptosis, indicating an unexpected proapoptotic role of Akt in the pemetrexed-mediated toxicity. Treatment of A549 cells with pharmacological inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin and Ly294002, similarly inhibited pemetrexed-induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis and Akt phosphorylation, indicating that PI3K is an upstream mediator of Akt and is involved in pemetrexed-mediated cell death. Previously, we identified cyclin A-associated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) as the principal kinase that was required for pemetrexed-induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis. The current study showed that inhibition of Akt function and expression by pharmacological inhibitors as well as Akt siRNA drastically inhibited cyclin A/Cdk2 activation. These pemetrexed-mediated biological and molecular events were also observed in a H1299 cell line. Overall, our results indicate that, in contrast to its normal prosurvival role, the activated Akt plays a proapoptotic role in pemetrexed-mediated S-phase arrest and cell death through a mechanism that involves Cdk2/cyclin A activation. © 2014 Chen et al.

84901409645	Prior EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy did not influence the efficacy of subsequent pemetrexed plus platinum in advanced chemonaïve patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma	Background: Tumor cells before and after epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy might display different characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of prior EGFR TKI therapy on the efficacy of subsequent pemetrexed plus platinum (PP) in advanced chemonaïve patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods: Advanced chemonaïve patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma receiving PP as first-line chemotherapy were enrolled retrospectively in two medical centers of Taiwan. The objective of this study was to compare objective response rate (ORR), disease-control rates (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of PP in patients with and without prior EGFR TKI therapy. Results: In total, 105 patients were analyzed. Sixty-one patients (58.1%) had prior EGFR TKI therapy and used PP as second-line treatment. The other 44 patients (41.9%) received PP as first-line therapy. ORRs of PP in patients with and without prior EGFR TKI therapy were 24.6% and 38.6%, respectively (P=0.138). DCRs of the two groups were 62.3% and 65.9%, respectively (P=0.837). The median PFS (6.1 versus 6.1 months, P=0.639) and OS (34.4 versus 32.3 months, P=0.394) were comparable between the groups with and without prior EGFR TKI therapy. In a subgroup analysis of patients with prior EGFR TKI therapy, there was no significant association between the efficacy of first-line EGFR TKI and the outcome of subsequent PP therapy. Conclusion: Our results suggested that prior EGFR TKI therapy would not influence the efficacy of subsequent PP therapy in advanced chemonaïve patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. © 2014 Tseng et al.

84907812127	Shisa3 is associated with prolonged survival through promoting β-catenin degradation in lung cancer	Rationale: Despite advances in treatment and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patient outcomes are still unsatisfactory. Objectives: To reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with NSCLC, a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms involved in cancer progression is urgently needed. Methods: By comparison of gene expression profiles in the cell line pair with differential invasion ability, CL1-0 and CL1-5, we found that Shisa3 was highly expressed in the low invasive cells. The effect of Shisa3 on invasion, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and anchorage-independent growth activities in vitro and on tumor growth and metastasis in mice models were examined. The underlying mechanism of Shisa3 was explored by microarray and pathway analysis. Finally, the correlation of Shisa3 expression and clinical outcome was also calculated. Measurements and Main Results: We identified Shisa3 as a novel tumor suppressor, which induces β-catenin degradation resulting in suppression of tumorigenesis and invasion in vitro. Shisa3 decreased the tumor growth in mice with subcutaneous implantation and reduced the number of metastatic nodules in mice with tail vein injection and orthotopic implantation. Shisa3 performs the tumor suppression activity through WNT signaling predicted by microarray analysis. Our data found that Shisa3 accelerates β-catenin degradation and was positively associated with overall survival and progression-free survival of NSCLC. Conclusions: Our results reveal that Shisa3 acts as a tumor suppressor by acceleration of β-catenin degradation and provide new insight for cancer prognosis and therapy.

13444311549	A pilot clinical trial of vaccination with dendritic cells pulsed with autologous tumor cells derived from malignant pleural effusion in patients with late-stage lung carcinoma	BACKGROUND. The authors conducted a pilot clinical trial to explore the vaccination of patients with late-stage lung carcinoma with dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with necrotic tumor cells derived from malignant pleural effusion specimens, and to evaluate the antitumor immune response induced by this therapy. METHODS. Autologous DCs were generated by culturing adherent mononuclear cells with interleukin-4 and granulocyte-macrophage-colony- stimulating factor for 7 days. Day-7 DCs were cocultured overnight with autologous necrotic tumor cells derived from pleural effusion specimens to allow internalization of tumor antigens. DCs were then treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 16 hours. The antigen-loaded DCs were injected into each patient's inguinal lymph nodes under sonographic guidance. Eight patients with late-stage nonsmall cell lung carcinoma were treated in this manner. Patients were vaccinated once weekly for 4 weeks and then boosted twice biweekly. RESULTS. The authors found that there was no Grade II/III toxicity and autoimmune response in all patients after intranodal injection of the DC vaccine. Minor to moderate increases in T-cell responses against tumor antigens were observed after DC vaccination in six of eight patients. Five patients had progressive disease. One patient had minor tumor response and two patients had stable disease. The two patients who had longer disease control also had better T-cell responses. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicated that it was feasible to immunize patients with lung carcinoma intranodally with DCs pulsed with necrotic tumor cells enriched from pleural effusion specimens, and this approach may generate T-cell responses and provide clinical benefit in some patients. © 2005 American Cancer Society.

1242306656	The Diagnosis of Pneumonia in Renal Transplant Recipients Using Invasive and Noninvasive Procedures	Study objectives: We used invasive and noninvasive procedures to determine the causes of pneumonia in renal transplant recipients. Subjects and methods: We retrospectively surveyed 565 renal transplant recipients (transplants received March 1984 to August 2001) to find those with pneumonia. Noninvasive diagnostic methods included serologic testing, and blood and sputum cultures with stains. Invasive procedures included fiberoptic bronchoscopy and percutaneous transthoracic procedures. Results: A total of 92 patients were enrolled. Of these, 71 patients had a definite etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia. The major infectious pathogens were bacterial (n = 21) and mixed bacterial infection (n = 10), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) [n = 18], and fungi (n = 8). Noninvasive and invasive procedures led to the diagnosis of pneumonia in 31.5% (n = 29) and 45.6% (n = 42) of patients, respectively. Bronchoscopy was used in 64 patients, with a diagnostic yield of 38 cases (59.3%). Patients were 3.62 times more likely to contract pneumonia within 12 months of renal transplantation than they were ≥ 12 months thereafter (95% confidence interval, 1.33 to 9.84). Twenty-seven of the 92 patients (29.3%) died. The pneumonia mortality rate has dropped significantly since 1996 (41.8% vs 10.8%, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Both invasive and noninvasive procedures are useful in the diagnosis of pneumonia, with declining mortality, in renal transplant recipients. Bacterial and mixed bacterial infection, TB, and fungal infection are the most common pathogens; cases are most likely to occur within 1 year after renal transplantation.
