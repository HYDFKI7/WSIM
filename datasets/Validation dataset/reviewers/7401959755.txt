33745179161	Study on the radial velocity in the chamber of dynamic rotary filter press	The flow mechanism in the chamber of a dynamic rotary filter press with flow rate and two-side permeations as in the actual operating condition was theoretically studied. The radial velocities at different radial positions under a constant flow rate, and at a definite radial position under different flow capacities were calculated and verified by the experimental data measured. The calculated results by using finite element method are in good conformity with the corresponding data measured by using laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). It means that the calculation method used is reliable. The results also show that the radial velocity is reduced with increasing the filtrate ratio PE and is increased with increasing the flow capacity. The radial velocity in three kinds of chamber, each with different types of disk-plate disk, grooved disk and bladed disk, were measured by using LDA, respectively. Under the same condition, the radial velocity distributions in those chambers with different types of disk mentioned above are similar and the radial velocity in the chamber with grooved disk or beaded disk is much higher than that in the chamber with plate disk, and among them, the radial velocity in the chamber with bladed disk is highest. So it is suggested that the filter press with bladed disks or grooved disks is the most preferable one for actual application.

33845668263	Formation of the intermediate nitronyl nitroxide-anthracene dyad sensing saccharides	We design a new saccharides sensor based on the ensemble of compound 2 with a boronic group and compound 3 with two phenolic -OH groups, taking advantage of the fluorescence quenching ability of nitronyl nitroxides and reversible boronate formation between boronic acid and diol. The results show that the fluorescence of compound 2 was largely quenched upon addition of compound 3 due to the formation of the intermediate nitronyl nitroxide-anthracene dyad 1. Sequential addition of saccharides such as fructose to the ensemble of compounds 2 and 3 together with dyad 1 induced the fluorescence enhancement. These results clearly demonstrate the possibility to employ the ensemble of compounds 2 and 3 (with dyad 1) to sense saccharides. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34248587915	Study on demulsification of crude oil emulsions by microwave chemical method	The demulsifying and separating experiments of crude oil emulsion were performed by using the heating method, the thermal chemical method, the microwave radiating method, and the microwave chemical method separately. The water content of this emulsion was 78v/v%, and the type was water-in-oil (w/o). The influence tendencies of the key factors on demulsification effect were explored by changing the heating temperature, the demulsifier amount used and the microwave radiating time in this paper. With the microwave chemical experiments on the self-made emulsions of different water content, the demulsification rate and separation efficiency were explored. The type of these emulsions were oil-in-water (o/w), water-in-oil (w/o) and the multiple type, related to the water content scopes which were less than 30v/v%, more than 70v/v% and between them, respectively. The separation effect by the microwave chemical method for the high water content crude oil emulsion was better than that of emulsion with lower water content. For the crude oil used in this experiment, the result could be obtained that the separation efficiency was about 95v/v% under the conditions of 50ppm of demulsifier, 10 seconds radiation time, and 1 minute settling time for the microwave chemical method.

34249977250	Effect of ultrasonic field on extracting oil from sunflower seed using sub-critical carbon dioxide	Effect of ultrasonic field on extracting oil from sunflower seed using sub-critical carbon dioxide was studied. Experimental results indicated that the extraction yields of sunflower seed oil using sub-critical carbon dioxide could be obviously enhanced by ultrasonic field. After extracting 240 minutes, extraction yields with ultrasound (100 W/L, 4s/6s) and without ultrasound were 94.81% and 74.82% under 25 MPa, 30°C and 3 L/h, respectively. Density of ultrasonic power and ultrasonic frequency fairly greatly affected the extraction yield, with increasing of density of ultrasonic power, extraction yield enhanced. Compared with 38 kHz ultrasound, 20 kHz ultrasound had advantage of extraction. It was reasonable to adapt 4s/6s model of ultrasonic wave irradiation, at the same time, initiation time of ultrasonication had some effects on the extraction yield. Results of GC/MS analysis showed that ultrasonication had not changed ingredients of sunflower seed oil and structure of every component. The mechanism of ultrasound enhancement in sub-critical carbon dioxide might be attributed to mechanical fluctuant and thermal effects.

84876754140	Experimental investigation on the dynamical characteristics on tower with frame	The value of dynamic characteristics is an important design parameter for calculating the seismic loads or wind loads on the tower with frame. A test model has been established for framed tower, and the experimental investigation includes single tower and framed tower on the dynamical characteristics respectively. Furthermore, the influence of support position on the dynamical characteristics of framed tower has been investigated when keeping the height of frame unchanged. The results show that, (1) the tower and the frame should be regarded as the whole unit, which is different from single tower, and factors of frame must be considered synthetically in dynamical calculation, (1) support position has a great effect on the dynamical characteristics of framed tower. With the increasing of support position height, the first-order frequency has a bit increase. However, the amplitude on the top of the tower, the second-order frequency and the damping ratio will significantly decline. The results may provide test data and technical support for the design of framed tower.

84887551860	Effect of fluid flow on stability of sieve tray structure	Several failures in industrial distillation and absorption columns are attributed to flow induced vibrations. It is important to have a basic understanding on the mechanism responsible for the flow induced vibrations. The strain measured shows that these vibrations may cause significant damage to the structures. The effect of superficial gas velocity (based on the hole area), liquid flow and the height of weir on the vibration of a sieve tray column was experimentally studied using a φ 600 mm plexiglass column with air-water system. Air and water were interacted by the way of cross flow, and the contacting regime was mixed-froth, which occurred most commonly in the atmospheric tower. Dynamic strain indicator was used to measure the radial strain of tray center, and fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm was adopted to analyze the vibration characteristics. The results show that the frequency value of tray vibration increases with the rise of superficial gas velocity, while decreases with the rise of the height of weir, and the effect of liquid flow is insensitive. When the operating conditions deviate from the normal range, it may cause large vibration and plastic deformation.

84897093042	Effects of thermal treatment on physical and expression dewatering characteristics of municipal sludge	The effect of thermal treatment on physical properties and dewatering characteristics of municipal sludge was further studied by series of thermal hydrolysis and dewatering (including filtration and expression) experiments. Bound water content, particle size and viscoelasticity of municipal sludge decreased, while specific surface area of sludge floc increased after thermal hydrolysis. The decreased softness and increased rigidity of treated sludge particles, contributed to forming a filter cake with higher permeability and lower compression coefficient during filtration process. Consequently, filtrate amount significantly increased by nearly 7 times during 60. min, and a much compacter and less elastic filter cake was built up. For expression stage, contribution of primary consolidation stage decreased from 0.071 to 0.016. Creep factor (η) increased by 11 times, suggesting that the mobility of particles in filter cake became easier, and the contribution of secondary consolidation stage also increased. In contrast, due to the markedly reduced bound water content, the contribution of tertiary consolidation stage decreased. With the increase of expression pressure, both effects of the primary and the second consolidation stages reduced slightly, while, the contribution of the tertiary consolidation stage had a slight increase. Rheology analysis indicated that viscoelasticity of sludge has a correlation to expression dewaterability in the range of our study. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

70349931139	Influence of different uneven subsidence patterns of foundation on the loading conditions of support legs on a spherical tank	For large spherical tanks, it is difficult to install all support legs in a reasonable same horizontal level, and the local subsidence of the foundation could cause unequal loading among the support legs. These conditions might reduce the strength of support and lower the overall safety level of the spherical tank. Four subsidence patterns which included single support subsidence, whole incline, two-side straddle subsidence and middle subsidence were analyzed using finite element method. The stress distributions of the whole spherical tank when subsidence occurred were obtained. It was found that the maximum stresses of the structure vary linearly with the change of the amount of subsidence under all patterns. Based on these results, the concept of support reaction unevenness was then put forward, and the unevenness was found, similar with that of the maximum stresses, to increase linearly with the increase of subsidence. Rules on the maximum compress stresses in the legs when subsidence exists were also analyzed which could be taken useful references in the accurate design of support legs of spherical tanks.

The demulsifying and separating experiments of the crude-oil emulsion were conducted by using the thermal chemical method and the ultrasonic chemical method separately. The crude oil emulsion samples were provided by the Dagang oil field of China and the water content was 35% volume/volume (v/v). The key influencing factors on demulsification effect were explored by changing the ultrasonic output power, the irradiating time, and the demulsifier amount in the experiments. The dehydrating ratios were compared among the self-made emulsions of different water content with the ultrasonic chemical method. The demulsifying velocity and dehydrating ratio for the high water content crude-oil emulsion was better than that of the emulsion with lower water content in the demulsifying experiments with the ultrasonic chemical method. For the crude-oil emulsion used in this experiment, the result was a dehydrating ratio of 97.7% under the condition of 100 W of ultrasonic output power, 10 min of irradiating time, 50 mg/L of demulsifier, and 75C of water bath temperature.

77957017101	Preparation of styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine magnetic polymer beads by microwave irradiation for analysis of trace 24-epibrassinolide in plant samples using high performance liquid chromatography	In the study, a kind of novel styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine (St-co-4-VP) porous magnetic polymer beads was prepared by microwave irradiation using suspension polymerization. Microwave heating preparation greatly reduced the polymerization time to 1. h. Physical characteristic tests suggested that these beads were cross-linking and possessed spherical shape, good magnetic response and porous morphologies with a narrow diameter distribution of 70-180μm. Therefore, these beads displayed the long-term stability after undergoing 100-time extractions. Then, an analytical method for the determination of trace 24-epiBR in plant samples was developed by magnetic polymer bead extraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. St-co-4-VP magnetic polymer beads demonstrated the higher extraction selectivity for 24-epiBR than other reference compounds. Linear range was 10.00-100.0μg/L with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 6.7%, and the detection limit was 6.5μg/kg. This analytical method was successfully applied to analyze the trace 24-epiBR in cole and breaking-wall rape pollen samples with recoveries of 77.2-90.0% and 72.3-83.4%, respectively, and RSDs were less than 4.1%. The amount of 24-epiBR in real breaking-wall rape pollen samples was found to be 26.2μg/kg finally. This work proposed a sensitive, rapid, reliable and convenient analytical method for the determination of trace brassinosteroids in complicated plant samples by the use of St-co-4-VP magnetic polymer bead extraction coupled with chromatographic method. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

IR.2S-(-)-cis-1,2-epoxypropyl phosphonate were analyzed on the basis of the liquid mixtures viscosity theory. With the proper viscosity equations, the theoretical calculation formula of mother liquor viscosity of R-(+)-α-phenethylammonium.IR.2S-(-)-cis-1, 2-epoxypropyl phosphonate with ethanol or water was obtained.

It shows that the theoretical viscosity calculation formula is well correlated with the systems containing a little water, but has some deviation with the system containing more water. The result also reveals that ethanol and a certain amount of water can efficiently reduce the viscosity of mother liquor, which supplies a simple and convenient way for engineering application in the chemical production of fosfomycin sodium.

79959358167	Simultaneous determination of trace sterols in complicated biological samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with extraction using β-sitosterol magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer beads	In this paper, an efficient and sensitive analytical method for the simultaneous determination of three trace sterols including ergosterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol in complicated biological samples was developed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with extraction using novel β-sitosterol magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer (mag-MIP) beads. Physical tests suggested that β-sitosterol mag-MIP beads prepared by a rapid microwave synthesis method possessed the porous morphology, narrow size distribution, stable chemical and thermal property. Due to the greatly enlarging surface area and the strong recognition to the target molecules, β-sitosterol mag-MIP beads have a higher enrichment factor for β-sitosterol (∼20-fold) and the higher selectivity for β-sitosterol and its analogs than that of β-sitosterol magnetic nonimprinted polymer (mag-NIP) beads. Under the optimum analytical conditions, all the target compounds achieved good chromatographic separation and sensitive detection without matrix interference. It was interesting that three target sterols were actually found in mushroom samples, and stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were actually found in serum and watermelon samples. The recoveries of spiked sample tests were in range of 71.6-88.2% with RSDs of 2.4-10.0% (n = 3). This method is reliable and applicable for the simultaneous determination of trace sterols in real biological samples based on the β-sitosterol mag-MIP bead extraction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84859134609	Optimal design of the accelerator disk in a two-stage piston pusher centrifuge using numerical simulation	This Article presented a numerical investigation for the optimal design of the accelerator disk of a two-stage piston pusher centrifuge, including the disk structure and the blade geometry. With six blades added, a novel accelerator disk was designed, and the effects of these blades on the centrifuge performance were analyzed. The calculated results showed that such new disk design could improve the mass flow rate and the transient velocity of the particles. Therefore, it indicated that the flow field was mostly dominated by blades. Besides, the new disk was tested by an industrial experiment. However, unfortunately, due to that the edges of blades were fractured during the industrial experiment, the geometric outline of the blades was further investigated. The force analysis results showed that the height and length of the blades had a major effect on the blades stresses. Thus, three ways including reducing height, shortening length, and cutting 45° angle were adopted to decrease the blades stress. Finally, according to the calculated results, an optimized geometric outline of the blades was obtained, and a disk with new design of blades was experimentally tested, which validated the design and optimization process by its good performance. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

The microwave synthetic procedure was optimized in detail. In particular, the interaction between GA3 and functional monomers was further studied for the selection of the optimal functional monomers during synthesis. It can be seen that the interaction between GA3 and acrylamide (AM) finally selected was stronger than that between GA3 and other functional monomers. GA3 mag-MIP beads were characterized by a series of physical tests. GA3 mag-MIP beads had a porous and homogeneous surface morphology with stable chemical, thermal and magnetic properties. Moreover, GA3 mag-MIP beads demonstrated selective and specific absorption behavior for the target compounds during unsaturated extraction, which resulted in a higher extraction capacity (∼708.4 pmol for GA3) and selectivity than GA3 mag-non-imprinted polymer beads. Finally, an analytical method of GA3 mag-AM-MIP bead extraction coupled with HPLC-MS detection was established and applied for the determination of trace GA1, GA3, GA4 and GA7 in rice and cucumber samples. It was satisfactory that GA4 could be actually found to be 121.5 ± 1.4 μg kg

Banana is extensive planted in the south of China and its stalks contain 63.8±0.5% (of dry materials) dissolved carbohydrates that can be degraded into pentose and/or hexoses, which can be suitable for bio-ethanol fermentation by yeast. The technics of the simultaneous sacchrification and fermentation was adopted with the novozyme (including NS50013 and NS50010), then the yeast was added into the mash after the hydrolysis time of 12h. The factors influenced the bio-ethanol yield at the hydrolysis and fermentation were confirmed by single factor experiments. The results were shown on g/g of dry banana stalks. As the results shown, the hydrolysis conditions were enzymic dosage 0.6-1.0ml/100g fresh banana stalks, with the substrates/water ratio at 1:1, pH 4.8-5.5, hydrolysis 12-18h at 35-40 °C. The fermentation conditions were pH 3-5, inoculums yeast 0.8g/100g of fresh banana stalks, ferment 36-48h at 40 °C. Besides, the trace elements such as Mn, Zn, Fe, etc, also influence the bio-ethanol yields. When the trace elements' concentration were controled at the range of 0.5-0.8ug/ml, the bio-ethanol yield increased nearly 10-20%. Under the optimal conditions, the bio-ethanol yields reached the climax at 0.40g/g of dry banana stalks which equivalent to 80.5% of the theoretical yield. ©2010 IEEE.

84870255600	Ultrasound field distribution and ultrasonic oxidation desulfurization efficiency	Ultrasonic oxidation desulfurization (UODS) has been considered a promising method for deeply desulfurization technology since it can be carried out using mild conditions. During the last few decades many experimental investigations have been carried out on optimizing the reaction condition such as ultrasonic irradiation time, oxidizing reagents amount, kind of organic acid and so on. But limited work has been reported on the influence of the ultrasonic cavitation field distribution. In this work, the relative intensity of the cavitation events has been measured with the aluminum foil erosion method in a commonly used ultrasonic cleaning vessel both in horizontal and vertical directions. The aluminum foil erosion image was then collected into computer by a scanner. In addition, the image processing program of MATLAB software was used to pretreat the erosion image and find out the positions of the erosion points so that the ratio of the erosion area to the entire area can be calculated which helped to quantify the measurement result since the erosion ratios was the representation of the cavitation intensity. The desulfurization efficiency was then measured in different position of the vessel. The results match well with the cavitation field distribution results which indicate that the cavitation field distribution can be used to guide the UODS process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84880015616	Optimal design of accelerator disk in two-stage piston pusher centrifuge	The vane centrifugal accelerator disk is a structure in the two-stage piston pusher centrifuge for material distribution. However, it is found that the material cannot be well accelerated and the particle is easily broken during the production process. Therefore, based on the blade design theory of rotating machinery, the optimal design was discussed for the centrifugal accelerator. The CFD numerical calculations were performed in two models with two different blades, variable angle helix and controllable angle curve. The flow condition in the accelerator could be obtained. And the radial velocity at the intermediate diameter and the tangential velocity were chosen to reflect the backflow in the accelerator and the haste effect, respectively. The simulation results show that the curve with the outlet angle 15° and the wrap angle 90° is the most beneficial for the dehydration of heavy soda. These results are consistent with the experimental data, which can provide the basis and guidance for the centrifuge in the production of heavy soda.

An experimental design with different equipment that was studied to discover the effect of the dehydration rate of banana stems. We are trying to extract natural fibers from Hainan immense resources of biological materials. The paper also relates to an equipment for slicing the banana stem into elongated strips and pressing the strips. The result shows that the dehydration rate of banana stem which pressed by Sugarcane Mill (SM) was 57.0%(roots), 58.0% (central) and 51.0% (sheath) respectively. The samples which pressed by Open Roll Mill (ORM) have a lower level of dehydration rate (29.3% of roots, 12.1% of central, 13.5% of sheath, respectively). © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84884497657	Numerical simulations of flow field and separation efficiency for wave-plate mist eliminator	Using particle transport multiphase flow model and RNG k-ε turbulence model in the CFX module of ANSYS12.1, the internal gas-droplet two-phase flow field and separation efficiency of wave-plate mist eliminator was numerically simulated. The flow field was thoroughly analyzed based on the graphic display of droplet trajectory, speed, pressure and whirlpool distribution, which lays a theoretical foundation for the optimization of structure design and the improvement of its mechanical properties. Numerical simulation results show that separation efficiency changes with bend angle, series, distance between parallel plates and airflow velocity at different particle sizes. This result agrees well with the existing theoretical calculation and experimental results, which is instrumental in further modifying the theoretical calculation expression.

84888137469	The influence of air content in water on ultrasonic cavitation field	Cavitation is a complex physical phenomenon affected by many factors, one of which is the gas dissolved in the medium. Researchers have given some efforts to the influence of gas content on sonoluminescence or some specific chemical reactions in and around the bubble, but limited work has been reported about the influence on the ultrasonic cavitation field distribution. In this work, the intensity distribution of the ultrasound field in a cleaning tank has been measured with the hydrophone. After analysed and visualised by MATLAB software, it was found that the cavitation intensity distribution in degassed water was much better than that in tap water. And further study proved that degassing process can improve the cavitation effect dramatically both in intensity and scope. Finally, the cavitation fields in mediums with different gas content were measured and the specific influence of air content on cavitation field was discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84889868720	Experimental and numerical study of the solid concentration distribution in a horizontal screw decanter centrifuge	The horizontal screw decanter centrifuge is an automatic and continuous settlement centrifuge; it is widely used in different industries. Within the centrifuge, the drum and screwpropeller rotate at different speeds in the same direction, and therefore, the fluid flow state is extremely complex. There is no theoretical method to describe the solid concentration distribution during the filtration separation process. Therefore, FLUENT software was applied to an M-2301-type horizontal screw decanter centrifuge to simulate the fluid flow situation in the centrifuge drum and obtain the solid concentration distribution. The simulation results showed that the solid volume fraction could reach 66.35 and 4.92% at the sediment outlet and the overflow outlet after 10 s of simulation, respectively, and it was in good agreement with the industrial experimental results. The research shows that the 3-D unsteady calculation combined with moving mesh is an effective technique to investigate solid concentration distributions in the decanter centrifuge. Furthermore, the input concentration, which affected the solid distribution and flow integrity in the drum, was analyzed. The results show that the horizontal screw decanter centrifuge can effectively handle high solid content suspensions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84891305069	Numerical simulation of separation process in a two-stage pusher centrifuge	The two-stage pusher centrifuge is a kind of continuous operation centrifuges, and is widely used in light industry, chemical industry, metallurgy, coal and other industries. As the first-stage drum does rotation movement and reciprocating motion at the same time, the fluid flow in it is extremely complex, and there is no yet theoretical method to describe the filtration separation process. Therefore, taking a p-100-type two-stage pusher centrifuge for example, this paper used FLUENT software to simulate it and to obtain the fluid flow situation within the centrifuge drum. At the same time, the feeding concentration and drum rotational speed parameters were changed to examine the influence of them on centrifuge separation. The results show that, as the feed concentration increases, the cake solids content, the recovery ratio of solid phase and the solid containing ratio of supernatant show the trend of becoming larger, while the initial time for the centrifuge separation to reach its stable state and the initial axial coordinate for the cake to reach its maximum solid content are reduced; with increasing rational speed, the recovery ratio of solid phase, the solid containing ratio of supernatant and the axial coordinate of the cake reach its maximum solid content become gradually smaller, while cake solid content is increasing, and there is no specific rule for the initial time of the centrifuge separation to reach its stable state. The results provide a series of references to optimize the design of the centrifuge structure.

84892498700	Measurement and visualization of ultrasonic cavitation field based on MATLAB	The common technique for determining spatial sound pressure fields is to scan the sound field pointwise, which is time-consuming and expensive and thus limits its application in the industry. Aluminum foil erosion method is cheap and easy to operate and has little effect on cavitation field, but it cannot be quantified. In this paper, aluminium foils were used to measure the distribution of the ultrasonic cavitation field in an ultrasonic cleaning vessel. Foil sample was dried, and black and white images were collected by the scanner image processing system and then imported into the MATLAB software. The MATLAB programs help to find out the position of the erosion point and calculate the ratio of the erosion area to the entire area. The erosion ratios can reflect the intensity of the cavitation, which means that the quantitative result has been achieved. Three-dimension erosion ratio data set was then built. The visualization of the cavitation field was realized by graphing the data in a spatial coordinate system using different colors to represent the variation of cavitation intensity. The distribution of the cavitation field on any planes can be derived by slicing the cavitation field. The result analysis shows that the spatial distribution regularity of the single transducer ultrasonic cavitation field can be derived and the reliability of the measure method can be verified in the mean time.

84892523012	Flow morphology within filter chamber of the new dynamic cross-flow plate and frame filter press	Plate and frame filter press is a filtering device widely used in the solid-liquid separation process. In order to meet the requirement of the rapid development progress of industrialization, the structure of plate and frame filter press is also constantly improved. By adopting diagonal tangential feeding, a new kind of dynamic cross-flow plate and frame filter press was proposed, which can enhance the filtration rate and improve the filtering efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics method was used in the paper to simulate the flow morphology within the filter chamber of the new plate and frame filter press. In the meantime, a small experimental device of plate and frame filter press with diagonal tangential feeding was built to observe the particle trajectory in the new filter and to comparatively analyze the superiority of the new diagonal tangential feeding over the traditional center feeding. The results show that, when using diagonal tangential feeding, under the pump pressure the suspension is tangentially fed into the filter chamber to form a vortex-like rotation, which can promote the thin filter cake comprised of the trapped tiny particles to gather toward the center, while the sweep flow area can only form thin filter cake and then the thin filter cake are taken by the subsequent fluid to the center, so that the filtration resistance decreases and the filtration rate of the initial stage accelerates greatly. The simulation results of the particle trajectory, and the filter cake formation laws within the filter chamber, and the filter time are basically the same as that of the experimental observations, which can also provide a basis for subsequent design optimization of the new plate and frame filter press.

Through the theory analysis and the practical application of turned mass dampers (TMD) in construction industry, the mass ratio of the damper was determined from 0.02 to 0.1. An experimental model was built and the stiffness formula of a single spring was derived. The size and parameters of spring in the dampers were calculated based on the formula. A VA-11 vibration analyzer was used to measure and record the data in the experiment. Picking up the vibration signals from the column model due to free vibration, the damping ratio of the system was calculated as the reference standard, thus investigating the influence of different dampers in different installation positions of column mode on the damper effect.

84896529798	Optimization design of sieve in two-stage piston pusher centrifuge	To solve the problem that the oversized resistance of sieve to filtrate, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT is used to simulate the motion trajectory of fluid in sieve, explore the influence of sieve angle on reduction of the resistance of sieve to filtrate, getting the best angle of sieve angle. The result shows that the inclined sieve is an effective method to reduce the flow resistance. With the increase of rotational speed, more and more filtrate and entrained particles concentrated on the left side wall of sieve throw away from the outlet, and hence the best inclined sieve changes with rotational speed. At speed of 1 000-1 100 r/min, 7° inclined sieve is the best for reduction of the flow resistance. At speed of 1 200-1 300 r/min, 8° inclined sieve is the best for reduction of the flow resistance.

84899706567	Optimization Study of Municipal Sludge Conditioning, Filtering, and Expressing Dewatering by Partial Least Squares Regression	The effect of different conditioner doses and different applied pressures on the dewaterability of municipal sludge during the filtration and expression stage was assessed using a series of experiments referred to as a uniform design. The relative importance of conditioner dose and applied pressure on the dewatering characteristics of municipal sludge was evaluated with a quadratic model using partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis. It was shown that the developed quadratic model was able to accurately predict the dewatering characteristics during the whole process. It was further shown that lime as a physical conditioner had the most significant impact on filtration rate, expression rate, cake dry solids content, net sludge solids yield, and total cycle time. Aluminum polychloride as the inorganic flocculant had a quite complex effect although not as significant as lime. Filtration pressure had only a slight effect on dewaterability of the municipal sludge, though higher feeding pressure was needed in order to enhance the total feeding amount. Furthermore, expression pressure was only of benefit to cake dry solids content and expression rate and failed to improve other dewatering characteristics of the municipal sludge. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

84902248778	Numerical simulation of water curtain application for ammonia release dispersion	Using water curtain system to forced mitigate ammonia vapor cloud has been proven to be an effective measure. Currently, no engineering guidelines for designing an effective water curtain system are available, due to lack of understanding of complex interactions between ammonia vapor cloud and water droplets, especially the understanding of ammonia absorption into water droplets. This paper presents numerical calculations to reproduce the continuous ammonia release dispersion with and without the mitigating influence of a downwind water curtain using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software ANSYS Fluent 14.0. The turbulence models k-. e and RNG were used to simulate the ammonia cloud dispersion without downwind water curtain. The simulated results were compared with literature using the statistical performance indicators. The RNG model represents better agreement with the experimental data and the k-. e model generates a slightly lesser result. The RNG model coupled with Lagrangian discrete phase model (DPM) was used to simulate the dilution effectiveness of the water curtain system. The ammonia absorption was taken into account by means of user-defined functions (UDF). The simulated effectiveness of water curtains has good agreements with the experimental results. The effectiveness of water mitigation system with and without the ammonia absorption was compared. The results display that the effectiveness mainly depends on the strong air entrainment enhanced by water droplets movement and the ammonia absorption also enhances the effectiveness of water curtain mitigation system. The study indicates that the CFD code can be satisfactorily applied in design criteria for an effective mitigation system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84904106661	Effect of thermal hydrolysis on rheological behavior of municipal sludge	Properly understanding of sludge rheological properties is important for designing of pumping and translating. Effect of thermal hydrolysis on rheological properties of municipal sludge was studied using a rheometer (DHR-2) with concentric cylinder geometry. Test results indicated both raw and thermal treated sludge displayed non-Newtonian rheological behavior with shear thinning, exhibiting thixotropic properties and viscoelasticity. The Herschel-Bulkley model could represent their flow behavior more accurately than other models. However, for the raw sludge, as solid content reached 120 g/L, fluidity disappeared, and all the rheological models could not describe it accurately. After thermal hydrolysis, the consistency index (k) decreased significantly, while the flow index (n) increased, suggesting that thermal treated sludge was much closer to the Newtonian fluid compared to the raw sludge. Both raw and treated sludge exhibited strong dependence on solid content and temperature. Correlations between solid content, temperature, and viscosity were expressed by an exponential equation and an Arrhenius type equation, respectively. Analysis of thixotropic properties illustrated that evolution of viscosity over time could be expressed by a first-order (solid content lower than 100 g/L) and a second-order thixotropic kinetic equation (solid content higher than 100 g/L), respectively, for raw sludge. For treated sludge, it could be simulated by a first-order thixotropic kinetic equation. Furthermore, the dynamic test indicated viscoelasticity of treated sludge decreased remarkably. For treated sludge, as the solid content was larger than 120 g/L, viscoelastic parameters were linearly correlated with logarithm frequency. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

In this study, NKC-9 ion-exchange resin and H-beta zeolite were selected as heterogeneous catalysts in the WCO esterification process and their esterification characteristics were compared by orthogonal experiments. NKC-9 resin showed higher activity and achieved a higher final conversion compared with H-beta zeolite under the same reaction conditions. Reusability experiments showed that NKC-9 resin still exhibited high activity after 5 runs. The effects of the mole ratio of alcohol to oil, reaction time, reaction temperature and the catalyst dose were investigated by multifactor orthogonal analysis. The influence of the free fatty acid (FFA) content was also investigated, and the result showed that the esterification rate could be as high as 98.4% when the FFA content was 6.3wt%. © 2014 Tianjin University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Designed a sinusoidal sound wave disturber, the vibration control principle of the disturbers was analyzed based on the theory of vortexes induced vibration. The wind tunnel experiment was carried out to study the influence of the parameters of the disturbers on the wind induced vibration. The result shows that the sinusoidal sound wave disturbers are effective to reduce the wind induced vibration; the vortex shedding frequency is reduced by the sound wave and multi-frequency vortexes are formed instead of single frequency vortexes due to the disturbers; it is an effective way to increase the number and the installation height of the disturbers; it is advisable to increase the frequency and fluctuation velocity of the disturbers within a proper range.
