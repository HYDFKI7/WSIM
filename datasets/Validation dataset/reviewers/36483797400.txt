17344373747	Mutations in the gene encoding gap junction protein associated with autosomal dominant hearing impairment	Hearing impairment is the most commonly occurring condition that affects the ability of humans to communicate. More than 50% of the cases of profound early-onset deafness are caused by genetic factors. Over 40 loci for non- syndromic deafness have been genetically mapped, and mutations in several genes have been shown to cause hearing loss. Mutations in the gene encoding connexin 26 (GJB2) cause both autosomal recessive and dominant forms of hearing impairment. To study the possible involvement of other members of the connexin family in hereditary hearing impairment, we cloned the gene (GJB3) encoding human gap junction protein β-3 using homologous EST searching and nested PCR. GJB3 was mapped to human chromosome 1p33-p35. Mutation analysis revealed that a missense mutation and a nonsense mutation of GJB3 were associated with high-frequency hearing loss in two families. Moreover, expression of Gjb3 was identified in rat inner ear tissue by RT-PCR. These findings suggest that mutations in GJB3 may be responsible for bilateral high-frequency hearing impairment.

20044367111	Diagnosis and surgical treatment of 102 cases of ventricular septal defect with patent ductus arteriosus	Objective: To summarize the experience of diagnosis and surgical treatment of ventricular septal defect with patent ductus arteriosus. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 102 cases of ventricular septal defect combined with patent ductus arteriosus who underwent surgical treatment. Preoperative ultrasonic cardiogram (UCG) showed ventricular septal defect combined with patent ductus arteriosus in 82 cases and ventricular septal defect in 20 cases. Results: The hospital mortality was 4. 9% (5/102). The reasons for death included low cardiac output syndrome (1 case), pulmonary hypertension crisis (2 cases) and respiratory failure (2 cases). In the remaining patients, the perioperative complications included lung infection (7 cases), pulmonary atelectasis (5 cases), hydrothorax (1 case), and pulmonary hypertension crisis (2 cases); and all the 15 patients recovered lastly. The pulmonary hypertension of all living patients decreased to some degree. The therapeutical effectiveness was satisfactory. Conclusion: Ventricular septal defect with patent ductus arteriosus is easy to be confused with ventricular septal defect clinically. At the same time, it is diffcult to form a correct diagnosis in some patients by UCG preoperatively. To prevent the occurrence of perfusive lung, it is important to reinforce pre-operative diagnosis and exploration during operation. Because pulmonary hypertension in patients with ventricular septal defect with patent ductus arteriosus emerges early and develops quickly, it tends to result in organic pulmonary hypertension which can make patients lose operation chances and influence the long-term therapeutical effect. Surgical operation should be performed as soon as possible. Optimal operative timing and proper perioperative management play important roles in surgical results.

22244478997	Surgical treatment of partial atrioventricular septal defect	Objective: To summarize the experience of surgical treatments of partial atrioventricular septal defect in 60 patients. Methods: From April 1999 to April 2004, 60 patients of partial atrioventricular septal defect were operated. Fifty-eight patients were performed with suture of the cleft of mitral valve and the other 2 were given mitral valve replacement; For closure of primum ASD, 53 patients with pericardial patches and 7 with Dacron patches. Coronary sinus was baffled to left atrium with kirklin procedure in 35 cases and baffled to right atrium with McGoon procedure in other 25 cases. Correct the accompanying cardiac deformity at the same time. Results: The hospital mortality was 3.3% (2/60) due to low cardic output syndrome. The incidence rate of complete atrioventricular block was 8.00% (2/35) in the group with Kirklin procedure and 6.06% (2/25) in the group with McGoon procedure. There was no statistical significance between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The follow-up was from 1 month to 5 years, and there was no late death. All cardiac function were improved except middle mitral regurgitation in 1 patient. Conclusion: Reasonable operative design, refined procedures, avoiding damage to conducting bundles and proper perioperative management are the key points in improving theraeutic effect.

22744454244	Prosthetic valve replacement in pediatric patients: Analysis of 105 cases	Objective: To summarize the experience in prosthetic valve replacement in pediatric patients. Methods: The clinical data of consecutive 105 children, 63 male and 42 female, aged 13 ± 3 (1.5 - 16), with the underlying diseases of rheumatic heart disease (n = 55), congenital heart diseases (n = 43), and infective endocarditis (n = 5), with the preoperative cardiac function of class II (n = 36), or class III or IV (n = 69), who underwent prosthetic valve replacement, including replacement of mitral valve (n = 58), aortic valve (n = 28), tricuspid valve (n = 5), mitral and aortic valves (n = 13), and mitral and tricuspid valves (n = 1), and tricuspid valvuloplasty ( n = 26), from May 1984 to May 2004, were respectively analyzed. Mechanical valves were used and took low dose anticoagulant warfarin was administrated to all cases. Postoperatively prothrombin time (PT) and international normal ratio (INR) were observed. Follow-up lasting 10 ± 4 years (6 months to 20 years) was performed among 100 discharged patients with a follow-up rate of 91.0%. Results: There were 5 early deaths (4.8%), mostly owing to serious low cardiac output syndrome, and 4 late deaths owing to endocarditis (n = 2), heart failure (n = 1), and serious arrhythmia (n = 1). The 87 surviving patients showed their cardiac function of class I - III. No serious complications related to anticoagulation and prosthesis dysfunction had been found. Conclusion: Prosthetic valve replacement with mechanical valve can be performed in pediatric patients with good outcome. Larger type of mechanical valve should be used as possible. Additional surgical procedures may be required to correct the concomitant malformations during the operation. Postoperative long-term low dose anticoagulant treatment is safe.

3042700201	Confirmation and refinement of a genetic locus for disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP1) at 12q23.2-24.1	Background: Our previous study has identified two loci for disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP), but the genes responsible are still unknown. Objectives: To narrow down the candidate regions and to assess candidate genes. Methods: A genome-wide scan and linkage analysis were carried out in a newly collected five-generation Chinese family with DSAP. In addition, six candidate genes were screened for possible DSAP-associated mutations. Results: DSAP in this family was associated with chromosome 12q. Fine mapping and haplotype construction refined the DSAP1 locus to a 4.4-cM interval. No disease-associated mutation was detected in CRY1, C4ST1, TXNRD1, HCF2, CMKLR1 or KIAA0789 genes. Conclusions: The DSAP1 locus was localized to a 4.4-cM interval at chromosome 12q23.2-24.1. CRY1, C4ST1, TXNRD1, HCF2, CMKLR1 and KIAA0789 genes were not associated with DSAP1.

3042820924	Fas ligand gene therapy for vascular intimal hyperplasia	Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor super-family, is expressed in all cell types examined, while physiologic expression of Fas ligand (FasL) is found predominantly in activated T-lymphocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and "immune-privileged" tissues. Activation of Fas following FasL binding activates caspases, which results in apoptosis. In the vasculature, there may be a delicate balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. Shifts in this balance could account for the accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in response to arterial injury, a major feature of vascular intimal hyperplasia. Intimal hyperplasia occurs in more than a third of patients receiving percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. Stenting with or without coating significantly reduces the incidence rate of angiographic restenosis and that of target vessel revascularization. However, "in-stent" intimal hyperplasia/restenosis remains a challenge for clinical cardiologists. Although both the cell types and mechanisms that contribute to intimal hyperplasia in response to vascular injury remain controversial, vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation appear to play an important role in the process. In animal models, cytotoxic and cytostatic gene therapy strategies targeted at the vascular smooth muscle cells have shown therapeutic potential for the treatment of vascular intimal hyperplasia. However, Fas ligand-based gene therapy appears to offer several advantages. In this review article, we will discuss the mode of FasL/Fas signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells and its therapeutic implications. We will also compare the relative merits of FasL with other cytotoxic and cytostatic gene therapy approaches for the treatment of intimal hyperplasia. © 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

33646073118	Effects of pulsation signal on the expression of nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells of human umbilical vein	Aim: To observe the effects of pulsation signal on expression of nitric oxide synthase mRNA (NOSmRNA), which can reflect endothelial cytoactivity in endothelial cell of human umbilical vein. Methods: The experiment was conducted in Biomaterial Laboratory of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Shanghai Bioengineering Co., Ltd. Sterile endothelial cells of human umbilical vein donated by cesarean-section puerperants voluntarily were cultured and passaged, subjects after 4 passages were divided into 2 groups: 1 Pulsatile culture group: There were cellular adherence after 6-8 days. Sugjects were pulsatily cultured in self-made pulsatile culture device. Pulsatile parameter: Pulsatile frequency was 150 beating per minute, stroke volume was 0.3 milliliten every time, pulsatile pressure was 30/9 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa). 2 Static culture group: Except pulsation, subjects were done the same as that in pulsation-culture group. There were 5 samples in every time-point of each group. Expressions of NOSmRNA in endothelial cell of human umbilical vein in both groups were detected by RT-PCR respectively on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th and 18th days. Results: Expressions of NOSmRNA in endothelial cell of human umbilical vein. 1 In the 1st and 4th day of culture, those in the static culture group were markedly higher than those in the pulsatile culture group [(1.0±0.55)vs(1.10±0.35); (1.17±0.23) vs (1.42±0.44),P < 0.05]. 2 Differences between two groups in the 2nd day were not remarkble [(1.16±0.108) vs(1.25±0.35),P > 0.05]. 3 Those in the pulsatile culture group on the 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th and 18th day of culture were obviously higher than those in the static culture group [(1.52±0.14) vs (1.27±0.30); (1.60±0.19) vs (1.16±0.33); (1.68±0.44) vs (0.99±0.31); (1.7±0.24) vs (1.1±0.94); (1.7±0.16) vs (1.0 ±0.28),P < 0.05]. Conclusion: Pulsation signal can enhance the expression of endothelial NOS mRNA in endothelial cells of human umbilical vein, which indicates that pulsation signal plays an important role in maintaining normal physiological function and can reinforce cellular bioactivity.

Methods The study enrolled 24 patients with congenital heart disease : 12 cases of norrcyanosis (group A) , and the other 12 cases of cyanosis (group B). During the operation the samples of myocardium in the right atrium were attained at 0 min ischemia , 20 min ischemia ,and 20 min reperfusion. They were used to evaluate the content of HSP70 by immunohistochemistry and activation of SOD and content of MDA by chemochromatometry. Results The content of HSP70 in myocardial cells during the operation was not significantly different in both groups ( P > 0. 05). The content of HSP70 significantly decreased in group B compared with that of group A ( P <; 0. 05). The activity of SOD significantly decreased and the content of MDA significantly increased in group B during the operation (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Decreased expression of HSP70 is associated with the decreased tolerance to ischemia- reperfusion injury in myocardial cells of cyanosis congenital heart disease. ©1994-2010 China Academic Journal Electronic Poblishing House.

34249715208	Multifactor analysis of postoperative mechanical ventilation supporting time in infants with congenital heart diseases	Objective To analyze the multiple factors affecting the postoperative mechanical ventilation supporting time in infants less than 10 kg with simple congenital heart diseases and to seize time by the forelock of extube and improve the outcome of surgical treatment. Methods Data of 231 infants less than 10 kg with atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect, and combining patent ductus arteriosus were retrospectively analyzed. The multivaricate stepwise logistic regression statistics were done for the predisposing factors affecting the ventilative supporting time. Results The ventilative supporting time was 3-375 (average 23.5 h) h. The multivaricate stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that severe pulmonary hyperpressure, cross - cramp aortic time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, preoperational pulmonary infection, membrane oxygenator, modified ultrafiltration, weight, and postoperative complications were significantly correlated to the ventilative supporting time. Conclusion Severe pulmonary hyperpressure, preoperational pulmonary infection, long cross -cramp aortic time, long cardiopulmonary bypass time, postoperative complications all prolong the ventilation supporting time; the use of membrane oxygenator and modified ultrafiltration during the operation and big weight can diminish the pulmonary complications and shorten the ventilation supporting time.

34548611853	Structural and hemodynamic study of right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with valved bovine jugular vein conduit in the canine model by color Doppler echocardiography	Objective To observate the structural and hemodynamic changes after the reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with valved bovine jugular vein conduit (BJVC) in the canine model by color Doppler echocardiography (UCG). Methods BJVC was used in the reconstruction of RVOT of 32 canines. UCG was used to observe the structure of the right ventricle and RVOT. The structure and hemodynamics were observed, and the diameter, width, blood velocity and pressure gradient (PG) were measured between the right ventricle and the conduits. Results In the first stage, UCG showed that PG between the right ventricle and BJVC was high in 5 canines, and a few anastomosis in BJVCs with main pulmonary artery was small. Blood velocity quickened and PG increased, and color Doppler showed that the bloodstream was very bright. In the second stage , 7 canines survived for 1 year after the implantation. One year after the operation, UCG showed that the valve closed well, no graft kinking or obvious regurgitation of the valve was observed. The PG of the valve was low. The BJVCs were unobstructed and there was no thrombus. AU the valves of BJVC opened well except one. In the third stage, 20 canines survived for 1 year after the implantation. UCG showed that the valve motion was good, no graft kinking or obvious regurgitation of the valve was observed. No neoplasm was observed. Conclusion UCG is one of the most useful measurements in the structural and hemodynamic study of RVOT reconstruction by BJVC in the canine model. The good evaluation of UCG implies that it is important for the study and clinical pratice.

35348991785	Two novel mutations of the LDL receptor gene associated with familial hypercholesterolemia in a Chinese family	Background: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a type of dominant autosomal disease that causes high levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In the past years, molecular data related to FH were limited in China. Now, to gain more information about FH, we analyzed one proband with a severe FH phenotype as well as his relatives. Methods: After the entire coding sequence and the intron-exon junctions of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene were amplified using PCR, we sequenced the LDLR gene of a Chinese FH family. RT-PCR was used to detect changes in the mRNA. Results: Two novel mutations were identified in the LDLR gene of this family. One, W165X, was a G>A substitution at the third nucleotide of codon 165. The other, IVS5-1G>A, was also a G>A substitution at the acceptor splice site of intron 5. The most striking discovery is that the proband was heterozygous for W165X but homozygous for IVS5-1G>A. The cDNA sequencing showed that the IVS5-1G>A mutation caused the insertion of 10 nucleotides, namely GCTCTCACAA, between exon 5 and axon 6. Conclusions: The two nucleotide variations are thought to be the FH-causing mutations because the co-segregation of the mutant allele with the phenotype of FH has been shown in this Chinese family. These data show an increase in the mutational spectrum of FH in China and verify a scarce mutational form in the LDLR gene.

36849052340	Promoter hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Alteration in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is one of the main causes of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The human runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), an important component of TGF-β pathway which is located at 1p36, is commonly deleted in a variety of human cancers, including ESCC. Hypermethylation of RUNX3 promoter was frequently found in gastrointestinal cancers, including those of stomach, liver, colon and pancreas. However, RUNX3 promoter methylation status in ESCC has not been studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether promoter methylation of the RUNX3 gene correlates with ESCC tumor progression. Accordingly, we first determined RUNX3 mRNA expression and methylation status of its promoter region in 42 primary tumors with ESCC and Eca-109, an ESCC cell line. Loss of RUNX3 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in 23 out of 42 (54.8%) ESCC specimens and Eca-109 cells. The Promoter hypermethylation was detected by Methylation Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (MS-PCR) in 27 out of 42 (64.3%) ESCC specimen and Eca-109 cells.Importantly, we found positive correlations, not only between the promoter hypermethylation and tumor clinical pathologic stages (P = 0.003), but also between the loss of RUNX3 mRNA expression and the tumor progression (P = 0.016). Finally, we observed that the loss of RUNX3 mRNA expression is statistically correlated with the promoter hypermethylation in these tumors (P < 0.001). Our results suggest that epigenetic silencing of RUNX3 gene expression by promoter hypermethylation may play an important role in ESCC development. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

0034130869	Identification of a locus for disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis at chromosome 12q23.2-24.1	Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis is an autosomal dominant cutaneous disorder characterized by many uniformly small, minimal, annular, anhidrotic, and keratotic lesions. The genetic basis for this disease is unknown. Using a genomewide search in a large Chinese family, we identified a locus at chromosome 12q23.2-24.1 responsible for disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. The fine mapping study indicates that the disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis gene is located within a 9.6 cM region between markers D12S1727 and D12S1605, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 20.53 (θ=0.00) at D12S78. This is the first locus identified for a genetic disease where the major phenotype is porokeratosis. The study provides a map location for isolation of a gene causing disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.

0033857954	Tbx5 mutation in Chinese patients with Holt-Oram syndrome	Objective: To analyse TBX5 mutation in Chinese patients with Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS). Methods: Seven HOS families were analysed with single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing. Results: Three SSCP changes were detected and identified as the TBX5 gene mutation at three new sites. One of the changes is a frameshift mutation caused by a base cytidine deletion at the cDNA sequence of 416, which altered all the codons after the point, thus it can not encode the protein of normal amino acid sequence; another is a missense mutation induced by a base substitution(C→ A) at the cDNA sequence of 145, which made the codon of that point change from CAG→AAG, and encoded amino acid changed from glutamine (Gln) to lysine (Lys), consequently the change weakened the function of TBX5 protein; the third is also a missense mutation which resulted from a base substitution (T→C) at the cDNA sequence of 161, this change made the codon of that point change from ATC→ACC, it changed the encoded amino acid from isoleucine(Ile) to threonine(Thr), which reduced the function of TBX5 protein. Conclusion: HOS in Chinese is caused by mutation in TBX5.

0034608285	Three novel TBX5 mutations in Chinese patients with Holt-Oram syndrome	Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant syndrome that comprises upper limb and cardiac defects. The gene responsible for HOS, TBX5, was isolated and many mutations have been identified in HOS patients. We analyzed 11 Chinese HOS patients (7 from three families and 4 sporadic cases) for TBX5 mutation by single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs). Three SSCP changes were detected in two of the three familial cases and one sporadic case. Sequence analysis identified three novel, heterozygous mutations in TBX5: a frameshift mutation caused by one base deletion [C416del] in one family, a mis-sense mutation (Gln49Lys) induced by a base substitution (C145A) in another family, and the other mis-sense mutation (Ile54Thr) by T161C in one sporadic case. The patients with the frameshift mutations had severer clinical manifestations that involved aplasia/hypoplasia of the arm and thumbs, while those with the mis-sense mutations presented with milder anomalies such as absent or hypoplastic thumbs but without arm abnormalities. These observations may support a genotype-phenotype correlation in HOS patients with TBX5 mutation. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

84867142633	Duplication of 8q12 encompassing CHD7 is associated with a distinct phenotype but without duane anomaly	Interstitial duplications of 8q12 encompassing CHD7 have recently been described as a new microduplication syndrome. Three 8q12 duplications have been reported with shared recognizable phenotype: Duane anomaly, developmental delay and dysmorphic facial features. We identified a 2.7 Mb duplication on chromosome 8q12 with SNP-array in a patient with growth delay, congenital heart defects, ear anomalies and torticollis. To our knowledge, this is the smallest duplication reported to date. Our findings support the notion that increased copy number of CHD7 may underlie the phenotype of the 8q12 duplication. Our study together with previous studies suggest that the 8q12 duplication could be defined as a novel syndrome. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84908132803	Results of two different approaches to closure of subaortic ventricular septal defects in children	OBJECTIVES: Percardiac device closure of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) is considered as an alternative to surgical repair in certain patients; however, the safety and validity of this technique in subaortic VSD are unproven. METHODS: A total of 463 patients with subaortic VSD underwent two different operative procedures. The clinical data were collected and a retrospective analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 145 (90.06%) cases were successfully occluded in Group A, and 16 (9.94%) patients were converted to open-heart surgery after occlusion procedure failure. A total of 302 patients in Group B underwent open-heart surgery. Multivariable analysis showed that a diameter of <5 mm in doubly committed subarterial VSD was the sole predictor of device closure failure. There were statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between the two groups in operation time, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, cardiac intensive care unit duration, postoperative hospitalization time and blood transfusion requirement. Patients were followed up with clinical examination, echocardiography (ECG) and transthoracic ECG during the period of 3-36 months (median, 12.6 months) at second week, third month, sixth month, first year, second year and third year after the operation. No acute complications or severe adverse events (death, valve injury, complete atrioventricular block and embolism) occurred either in the early period or during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Percardiac device occlusion is a safe, effective and efficient option for treating subaortic VSD in selected patients.

Methods: Between January 2003 and January 2008, 39 infants with large ASD or VSD complicated by pneumonia were admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital. Thirty-six patients underwent surgical repair within 7-10 days after pneumonia had been controlled. Mean age was 5.4 ± 3.4 months and mean weight was 4.7 ± 1.6 kg in the 36 patients. Three patients received conservative treatment due to uncontrolled lung infections. Results: Of the 36 patients, 33 had successful surgery and 3 (8.3%) died of serious low cardiac output (n = 1) or respiratory failure due to congenital tracheostenosis (n = 2). The 33 survivors showed normal growth and development in a 6 month-5 year follow-up. Of the 3 patients receiving conservative treatment, 1 died of cardiopulmonary failure and 2 were discharged after the symptoms had been improved. Conclusions: With increasing medical experience and technique, early surgical operation may he performed with good outcomes in infants with large ASD or VSD complicated by pneumonia.

57349194246	Experiences in severe chest trauma of children in 20 years	Though chest trauma in children is not so common as it is in adults, it may be life-threatening and suggest a high mortality. Herein we retrospected 59 cases of severe chest trauma of children out of 1506 chest trauma cases during 1986-2006 in our department. Features including demographic characteristics, causes, injury types, associated wound had been collected. There were 42 males (71.18%), 17 females (28.82%), 30 cases (50.84%) in the former 10 years and 29 cases (49.16%) in the latter 10 years. The incidence of children's severe chest trauma was 4.9% and 3.2%, respectively, averagely 3.9%. In these 59 cases, 46 cases were treated conservatively, 13 cases were treated by surgery. Four patients died, two in operations, the others attributed to ARDS and cardiac arrest, respectively. The cure rate was 93.22%. Statistic method was used to compare between two groups and with published results in the literature. Children's severe chest trauma is characteristic and different from adults. In our experience, accurate diagnoses and intensive care are very important to save their lives. © 2008 Published by European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. All rights reserved.

65349149999	Correlation of serum levels of VEGF and SDF-1 with the number and function of circulating EPCs in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease	Objective: To examine the number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in children with cyanotic congenital heart diseases (CHD) and study their correlation with serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Methods: Fifteen children with tetralogy of Fallot (cyanotic group) and 15 age- and sex-matched children with ventricular septal defect (control group) were enrolled. Serum levels of VEGF and SDF-1 were measured using ELISA. Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and cultured in vitro. EPCs were identified by immunofluorescence and were counted under a microscope. Modified Boyden chamber assay and the MTT assay were used to measure the migration and proliferation capacities of EPCs. EPCs adhesion ability assay was performed by replating cells on fibronectin-coated dishes, and then adherent cells were counted. The correlations of serum levels of VEGF and SDF-1 with the number and function of circulating EPCs were assessed by linear regression analysis. Results: Serum levels of VEGF (201.42 ± 44.74 ng/L vs 113.56 ± 35.62 ng/L; P < 0.05) and SDF-1 (3.45 ± 1.07 ng/L vs 1.05 ± 0.99 ng/L; P < 0.05) in the cyanotic group were higher than those in the control group. There was a positive correlation between serum levels of VEGF and SDF-1 (r = 0.675, P < 0.01). The number of EPCs (× 200 field) in the cyanotic group significantly increased compared with that of the control group (72.2 ± 9.73 vs 51.2 ± 3.83; P < 0.01). The functional activities of EPCs, including proliferation, migration and adhesion capacities, were augmented in the cyanotic group compared with those in the control group. The increased number and function of EPCs and the increased serum levels of VEGF and SDF-1 were consistent in the cyanotic group, with a correlation coefficient of 0.8395, 0.5491, 0.6376 and 0.7392 respectively. Conclusions: The number and functional activity of EPCs as well as serum levels of VEGF and SDF-1 increased in children with cyanotic CHD. Serum levels of VEGF and SDF-1 were correlated to the number and functional activity of EPCs. Serum VEGF and SDF-1 together with circulating EPCs may play important roles in the pathology and physiology in these patients.

70449706059	Liver X receptors are negative regulators of cardiac hypertrophy via suppressing NF-κB signalling	AimsNuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a critical role in cell growth and inflammation during the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Several members of nuclear receptor superfamily, including liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ), have been shown to suppress inflammatory responses, but little is known about their effects in cardiomyocytes.Methods and resultsWe investigated LXR expression patterns in pressure overload-induced hypertrophic hearts and the hypertrophic growth of the LXRα-deficient hearts from mice (C57/B6) in response to pressure overload. The underlying mechanisms were also explored using cultured myocytes. We found that cardiac expression of LXRα was upregulated in pressure overload-induced left ventricular hypertrophy in mice. Transverse aorta coarctation-induced left ventricular hypertrophy was exacerbated in LXRα-null mice relative to control mice. A synthetic LXR ligand, T1317, suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to angiotensin II and lipopolysaccharide treatments. In addition, LXR activation suppressed NF-κB signalling and the expression of associated inflammatory factors. Overexpression of constitutively active LXRα and β in cultured myocytes suppressed NF-κB activity.ConclusionLXRs are negative regulators of cardiac growth and inflammation via suppressing NF-κB signalling in cardiomyocytes. This should provide new insights into novel therapeutic targets for treating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

77952830873	Surgical repair for anomalous drainage of left superior vena cava to left atrium	Objective: To investigate the characters and surgical treatment methods of anomalous drainage of left superior vena cava to left atrium. Methods: Clinical data of 8 cases were analyzed retrospectively. The patients aged from 6 months to 168 months with weight between 6 and 29 kg. Results: The associated cardic lesions existed in all patients; 4 had partial atrioventricular septal defect (PAVSD), including 1 coronary sinus orifice atresia (CSOA), 1 ventricle septal defect (VSD), 1 ventricle septal defect associated with right ventricular outlet tract stenosis (VSD/RV-OTS), and 1 atrial septal defect (ASD) and complete atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD), respectively. No patient died. Preoperation diagnosis was in 1 case, intraoperation diagnosis in 5 cases, and postoperation diagnosis in 2 cases due to reoperation for hypoxemia. Three patients were repaired by intratrium tunnel, and the other 5 were managed by extracardic shunt. Conclusion: This lesion is easily missed in preoperation diagnosis, which can be avoided by awareness and careful inspection. The methods for management of anomalous drainage of left superior vena cava to left atrium depend on time of diagnosis and experience of surgeons.

77956708317	A rare case of Gerbode defect associated with double orifice mitral valve	Gerbode defect is an unusual cardiac defect; its association with a double orifice mitral valve has not been previously reported. We present a case of a 45-year-old woman who complained of palpitation and dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography revealed an abnormal communication between the left ventricle and the right atrium, but misinterpreted a double orifice mitral valve as fusion of the anterolateral commissure. The Gerbode defect was closed during cardiopulmonary bypass, while the double orifice mitral valve was left untouched. The patient was discharged 16 days postoperatively. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

78650211955	Conditional PPARγ knockout from cardiomyocytes of adult mice impairs myocardial fatty acid utilization and cardiac function	While the roles of PPARα and PPARσ (β) in transcriptional regulation of myocardial lipid metabolisms are well established, an essential role of PPARγ in regulating lipid metabolisms in the adult heart remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether PPARγ is required for normal myocardial lipid metabolism at basal condition in adult mice. We assessed the short-term cardiomyocyte-restricted PPARγ knockout mice with a Tamoxifen inducible Cre-LoxP mediated gene targeting strategy. The expression of PPARγ mRNA and protein in cardiomyocytes of adult mice was substantially reduced after short-term induction. Transcript and protein levels of important proteins in fatty acid uptake and oxidation, such as CD36, heart type-fatty acid binding protein (FABP), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) were reduced in the PPARγ deficient hearts. Myocardial fatty acid utilization and cardiac contraction were depressed in PPARγ deficient hearts. The PPARγ deficient hearts exhibited modest cardiac hypertrophy compared with controls. These results indicate that PPARγ is a transcription factor that is required for basal myocardial fatty acid utilization in the adult heart.

0036408582	A novel locus (DSAP2) for disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis maps to chromosome 15q25.1-26.1	Background: Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a chronic cutaneous disorder characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border. It develops in teenagers in sun-exposed areas of skin and usually follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The first locus for DSAP was localized to chromosome 12q23.2-24.1, but no gene responsible for porokeratosis has been identified to date. Objectives: To determine whether DSAP is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and to identify the disease gene locus in a three-generation Chinese family with DSAP. Methods: Genetic linkage analysis was carried out in this family using 15 microsatellite markers between D12S1671 and D12S369 on chromosome 12q, followed by a genome-wide scan with 382 microsatellite markers from the autosomes. Results: Genetic linkage analysis with chromosome 12q markers suggested that the locus in this family is not linked to chromosome 12q. A genome-wide scan and fine mapping finally localized the locus for DSAP in this family to a 6.4-cM region between markers D15S1023 and D15S1030 at chromosome 15q25.1-26.1. This DSAP locus was named DSAP2. Conclusions: The previous results and this study have shown that DSAP is a genetically heterogeneous disorder: a novel locus for DSAP, termed DSAP2, was mapped to a 6.4-cM region between markers D15S1023 and D15S1030.

79960823217	Evaluation of minimally invasive peratrial device closure of secundum atrial septal defects in children	Objective To introduce peratrial device closure of secundum atrial septal defects (ASD) under the guidance of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in children, and to summarize the clinical experiences. Methods A total of 115 children with secundum ASD (the occlusion group) underwent peratrial device closure of atrial septal defects through a small sternotomy under TEE guidance without cardiopulmonary bypass. Children were followed up closely for 1 - 13 months. Another 59 children (the bypass group) had closed atrial septal defects under cardiopulmonary bypass during the same period. The differences in the operation duration, convalescence and complication between the 2 groups were compared. Results Except 1 patient was operated under the CPB, the rest 114 patients in the occlusion group were successfully closed by the occluders. The duration of the operation, mechanical ventilation, intensive care and hospitalization, and the rate of blood-transfusion in the occlusion group were significantly lower than those in the bypass group ( P <0. 01) , with no difference in complications in the 2 groups (P>0.05). Conclusion Minimally invasive peratrial device closure of ASD without CPB is a relatively simple, safe and effective operation under lhe guidance of TEE for children. The short and mid-term clinical outcomes are promising. Long-term follow-up is indispensable.

84862811714	Congenital heart defect and mental retardation in a patient with a 13q33.1-34 deletion	13q deletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by deletions of the long arm of chromosome 13. Patients with 13q deletion display a variety of phenotypic features. We describe a one-year-old female patient with congenital heart defects (CHD), facial anomalies, development and mental retardation. We identified a 12.75. Mb deletion in chromosome region 13q33.1-34 with high resolution SNP Array (Human660W-Quad, Illumina, USA). This chromosome region contains about 55 genes, including EFNB2, ERCC5, VGCNL1, F7, and F10. Comparing our findings with previously reported 13q deletion patients with congenital heart defects, we propose that the 13q33.1-34 deletion region might contain key gene(s) associated with cardiac development. Our study also identified a subclinical deficiency of Factors VII and X in our patient with Group 3 of 13q deletion syndrome. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84863601474	Identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer	Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer. Improvement in the clinical outcome of patients is likely to be achieved by the identification of molecular events that underlie the oncogenesis of ovarian cancer. Here we show that the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is aberrantly activated in ovarian cancer. Using an unbiased and global phosphoproteomic approach, we profiled 69 Chinese primary ovarian tumor tissues and found ALK to be aberrantly expressed and phosphorylated in 4 tumors. Genetic characterization of these ALK-positive tumors indicated that full-length ALK expression in two serous carcinoma patients is consistent with ALK gene copy number gain, whereas a stromal sarcoma patient carries a novel transmembrane ALK fusion gene: FN1-ALK. Biochemical and functional analysis showed that both full-length ALK and FN1-ALK are oncogenic, and tumors expressing ALK or FN1-ALK are sensitive to ALK kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian tumor tissue microarray detected aberrant ALK expression in 2% to 4% serous carcinoma patients. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and identify ALK as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of serous ovarian carcinoma and stromal sarcoma patients. ©2012 AACR.

84864117994	Microduplication of 3p25.2 encompassing RAF1 associated with congenital heart disease suggestive of Noonan syndrome	Noonan syndrome (NS) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous disorder with congenital heart defects (CHD), short stature, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. Gain-of-function mutations in RAF1 can cause NS and the highly related NS with multiple lentigines (previously known as LEOPARD syndrome). Here we report on a 15-year-old male with NS phenotype: short stature, heart defects, low posterior hairline, facial malformations, malformed left ear with sensorineural hearing loss, widely spaced nipples, and unilateral upper limb anomaly. Using high-resolution SNP array technology, we identified in this patient a 0.25Mb microduplication at 3p25.2 in which RAF1 is located. Sequence analysis did not identify mutations in genes associated with Holt-Oram syndrome. These findings suggest that duplications of genomic regions encompassing RAF1 could cause NS and are consistent with the notion that rare copy number variations encompassing causative genes may underlie a small percentage of patients with syndromic CHD like NS. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..

84866078747	Echo-cardiography-guided occlusion of ventricular septal defect via small chest incision	Objective: To elucidate the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative utility of echocardiography technology in occlusion of ventricular septal defect (VSD) via small chest incision. Methods: We performed occlusion of VSD via small chest incision in 446 children. Before surgery, a multiple-section transthoracic echo-cardiogram (TTE) was employed to evaluate various parameters (including the size, position, and type) of the VSD region as well as the condition of neighboring tissues. During surgery we reassured the size of the occluder, meanwhile, guiding placement of the occluder by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Patients also received postoperative follow-ups at regular intervals. Results: Out of the 446 VSD cases, the defects of 412 patients were successfully closed; a 92.4% successful rate. All patients received follow-ups one year after operation. The occluders had stayed firmly and echoed clearly. No notable residual shunt or valve regurgitation was discovered. Conclusion: During occlusion of VSD via small chest incision, echo-cardiogram technology (including TTE and TEE) can play a vital role by helping screen cases preoperatively, by guiding the closure intraoperatively, and by evaluating therapeutic efficacy postoperatively, providing relatively accurate and accountable results at all stages.

84866083344	Impact of down syndrome on the surgical treatment of congenital heart defects	Objective: To evaluate the impact of Down syndrome (DS) on surgical management in patients with congenital heart defects (CHD). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data from 35 children with DS and CHD, who underwent cardiac surgery between 2004 and 2009. The data on surgical mortality, complications and follow-up results are emphasized. Results: All of the patients underwent primary repair. One child (2.9%) with DS and complete atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD) died early postoperatively because of pulmonary hypertension. Two patients (5.7%) had low cardiac output syndrome, and 15 (42.9%) suffered pulmonary complications. III° atrioventricular block (AVB) occurred in 4 patients (11.5%). Thirty children who were followed up 10 months to 6 years [(3.8 ± 1.1) years] are in NYHA class I or II. There were no reoperations or later death. Conclusion: CHD in DS children can be repaired with a low risk of mortality, although a high incidence of severe infections and III° AVB can result in a complicated postoperative course. The results of mid-term follow up are satisfactory.

84867652053	Novel ZFPM2/FOG2 variants in patients with double outlet right ventricle	Congenital heart defects (CHDs) occur in about 0.5-1% of all newborns and are the most common birth defects. Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) accounts for approximately 1-3% of all CHDs. Similar to Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), DORV is a subtype of contruncal heart defects (CTDs) and is anatomically characterized by a malposition of the great arteries. We described a boy with chromosomal translocation: 46, XY t (8; 18) (q22; q21) that may disrupts the ZFPM2/FOG2 locus. The coding sequences of ZFPM2/FOG2 were determined in 38 patients with sporadic DORV, 95 patients with TOF, and 12 patients with transposition of the great arteries. Five DNA sequence variants affecting variably conserved residues of ZFPM2/FOG2 were identified in patients with TOF type or ventricular septal defect type of DORV. Three novel mutations (p.V339I, p.K737E, and p.A611T) were reported for the first time. The other two mutations (p.M703L and p.Q889E) were reported in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia but not in patients with CHD. Our finding suggests that variants of the ZFPM2/FOG2 gene might be a common cause of DORV. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84869112031	Efficacy comparison between micro invasive occlusion procedure and extracorporeal circulation procedure for treating patients with simple ventricular septal defect	Objective: To compare the efficacy between micro invasive occlusion procedure and extracorporeal circulation procedure for treating patients with simple ventricular septal defect. Methods: Two hundred and twenty patients with simple ventricular septal defect (except subarterial ventricular septal defect) were randomly divided into micro invasive group (n = 116) and traditional cardiopulmonary bypass surgery group (n = 104). Clinical data were collected and compared at baseline and at 3, 30 and 180 days after surgery. Results: Age, gender, body weight and ventricular septal defect type were similar between the two groups (all P > 0.05). Operation time and hospitalization duration were significantly shorter in the micro invasive group than the traditional cardiopulmonary bypass surgery group (all P < 0.05). The proportion of blood transfusion was less in micro invasive group than the traditional cardiopulmonary bypass surgery group [2.59% (3/116) vs. 72.12% (75/104), P < 0.01]. Three days after surgery, incidence of mild and above tricuspid insufficiency was less in micro invasive group than the traditional cardiopulmonary bypass surgery group [0.86% (1/116) vs. 2.88% (3/104), P < 0.05]. There was one patient developed mild pericardial effusion at 30 days post surgery in micro invasive group. There was no intracardiac infection in the two groups during follow-up. At 30 and 180 days post surgery, incidence of residual shunt was also less in micro invasive group than the traditional cardiopulmonary bypass surgery group [1.72% (2/116) vs. 7.69 (8/104) and 0 (0/116) vs. 7.69 (8/104), all P < 0.05]. After surgery for 3, 30 and 180 days, transthoracic echocardiography derived chamber size, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and left ventricular ejection fraction were similar between the two groups (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: The efficacy is similar for patients with simple ventricular septal defect (except subarterial ventricular septal defect) using micro invasive occlusion therapy or extracorporeal circulation surgery. Micro invasive occlusion procedure can shorten operation and hospitalization time, and reduce the need for blood transfusion and risk of developing procedural-related tricuspid insufficiency and post-procedural residual shunt.

84870221881	Transesophageal echocardiographic guidance of percardiac device closure of intracardiac defects in patients weighing less than 10 kg	Background: To evaluate the technology of transesophageal echocardiographic guidance of percardiac closure in patients with low weight. Methods: Forty-two patients with intracardiac defects, aged from two months to five years (median, 18.4 months) and weighted from 4 to 10 kg (median, 8.9 kg), underwent attempted percardiac device closure under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. Results: Thirty-nine (93%) patients successfully underwent occlusion, whereas three patients (7.1%) were converted to conventional open-heart surgery. There was no mortality. They were followed up from 3 months to 15 months (median, 9.4 months). First degree atrioventricular block was detected in one patient at the time of discharge. The most common electrocardiogram change was bundle-branch block, which developed in three (7.7%) patients during follow-up. New mild mitral valve regurgitation (MR) was detected in three patients after operation and disappeared in one but remained in two others. Pericardial perfusion and recurrent intubation developed in one patient, respectively. The incidence of late complications is 5.1% (2/39) including low cardiac output syndrome and residual shunt in one patient, and moderate pericardial perfusion in one patient, respectively. No complication such as device dislocation, thrombosis, and obstruction of left or right ventricular outflow tract was found during the follow-up. Conclusions: This initial success indicates that transesophageal echocardiographic guidance of percardiac device closure will aid in the treatment of intracardiac defects in selected patients weighing less than 10 kg with good early outcomes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84876038770	Progress in nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (CD39/NTPDase-1) and thrombotic and vasoprotective effect	Blood platelets maintain vascular integrity and promote hemostasis following interruption of vessel continuity. Biochemical or physical damage to coronary, carotid, or peripheral arteries promotes excessive platelet activation and recruitment culminating in vascular occlusion and tissue ischemia. CD39, or NTPDase-1, is an integral component of the endothelial cell surface. It maintains vascular fluidity, acts solely on the platelet releasate, is efficacious in animal models. It metabolically neutralizes a prothrombotic releasate via deletion of ADP-the major recruiting agent responsible for formation of an occlusive thrombus. Meanwhile, solCD39 reduces ischemia-induced norepinephrine release in the heart by modulating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which can prevent fatal arrhythmia. Moreover, solCD39 ameliorates the sequelae of stroke in cd39-null mice. CD39 may represent the next generation of cardioprotective and cerebroprotective therapy method.

84878703231	The application of pulmonary valve biorifice for reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract in tetralogy of Fallot	Background: To introduce a new technique to create a pulmonary valve biorifice for the reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and to summarize the initial clinical experiment.Methods: The new technique of reconstructing the right ventricular outflow tract with pulmonary valve biorifice was used in 53 cases of TOF (the observation group). While the conventional technique for reconstructing the right ventricular outflow tract was used in other 50 cases of TOF (the control group). The clinical Data of all cases was reviewed retrospectively.Results: The ages, weights, cardiopulmonary bypass time, cardiac arrest time, as well as the post operation ventilation support time were not different significantly between groups. Unlike patients in the control group, patients from the observation group had shorter duration of ICU stay. Post- operation, in the observation group, only 2 cases had a large amount of pleural effusion, 1 case had mid-level effusion and 8 cases had a small amount of pleural effusion. While in the control group, there was 1 case of a large amount of effusion, 5 cases of mid-level effusion and 17 cases of a small amount of pleural effusion. 1 week after the operation, all patients were rechecked by echocardiography and no evidence of pulmonary valve stenosis was found. In the observation group, moderate pulmonary valve regurgitation was found in 8 cases, and mild regurgitation was observed in 15 cases. In the control group, severe regurgitation was observed in 3 cases, moderate regurgitation in 17 cases, and mild regurgitation in 16 cases. 33 cases from the observation group were rechecked six months, post-operation, and moderate-mild pulmonary regurgitation was found in 3 cases. As a follow up, 18 cases from the observation group were rechecked 1 year later, and no pulmonary regurgitation was found.Conclusion: The new technique to create pulmonary valve biorifice can reduce the pulmonary valve regurgitation, reduce postoperative pleural effusion, and improve the early surgical outcome. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84879539710	Asymmetric occluder in minimal-invasive surgical device closure of ventricular septal defects	Objective: To discuss the suitable types of ventricular septal defects for asymmetric occluders, and elucidate the critical role of echocardiography in choosing occluders, guiding successful occlusion and avoiding injury during operation. Methods: We retrospectively studied 179 patients with ventricular septal defects who received minimal-invasive surgical device closure with asymmetric occluder. We analyzed the types, size and morphology of ventricular septal defects suitable for asymmetric occluders. The therapeutic efficiency was evaluated by follow-ups. Results: Out of the 179 successful cases treated with asymmetric occluders, 86.59% had perimembranous ventricular septal defects, and double-committed sub-arterial ventricular septal fects accounted for 13.41%. In general, the size of occluders to be selected was the maximum diameter of the defects plus 2-3 mm. Follow-ups showed that occluders were placed and fixed properly. No severe residual shunt, valve regurgitation or heart block were discovered. Conclusion: Application of asymmetric occluders expands the range of indications for occlusion via small chest incision. Accurate echocardiography helps to improve the safety and successful rate of the surgery.

Methods A total of 62 patients with VSDs immediately below the aortic valve underwent percardiac device closure without cardiopulmonary bypass. Results There were no deaths. Of 62 patients, 52 (83.9%) underwent successful closure and 10 (16.1%) were converted to open-heart surgery due to tricuspid regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and a residual shunt. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed the type and diameter of VSD were associated with the failure of device closure. There were no severe adverse events. Follow-up ranged from 13 to 31 months (mean, 22.3 ± 5.2 months). Early and late complications occurred in 10 patients (19.2%) and two patients (3.8%), respectively. Conclusions Excellent short-term results can be achieved in selected patients with percardiac device closure of subaortic ventricular septal defects. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12134 (J Card Surg 2013;28:456-460) © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84881251446	Echocardiography in mini-invasive surgical device closure of secundum atrial septal defects	Objective: To discuss the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative application of echocardiography in mini-invasive surgical device closure of secundum atrial septal defects, including those special and difficultly-occluded defects. Methods: We performed mini-invasive surgical device closure of secundum atrial septal defcts on 287 patients. Before the surgery, transthoracic echocardiography was applied for screening; during the surgery we reassessed the sizes of the defects and their remaining margins, designated the suitable occluders, and guided the placement of the occluders by multiplane transesophageal echocardiography. The patients were postoperatively followed up at regular intervals by multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (MTEE) which was employed to assess the therapeutic efficacy. Results: Out of the 287 atrial septal defects, 276 (96.1796) were successfully closed. There were 37 porous defects and 23 cases with short posterior-inferior margin of defects. Follow-ups at intervals showed the occluders stayed firmly and echoed clearly. No notable residual shunt or valve regurgitation was observed. Conclusion: Echocardiography plays a vital and reliable role in mini-invasive surgical device closure of secundum atrial septal defects, especially those special and difficultly-occluded defects.

84882629393	A 1.1Mb deletion in distal 13q deletion syndrome region with congenital heart defect and postaxial polydactyly: Additional support for a CHD locus at distal 13q34 region	13q deletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, especially for group 3 deletion (13q33-q34 deletion). Previously we described a patient with congenital heart defect and mental retardation and proposed that a distal 6. Mb region might contain the causative gene of congenital heart defect. Here we present a new patient with congenital heart defects (CHD), hand and foot anomalies and mild mental retardation. We identified a 1.1. Mb deletion at chromosome 13q34 with high resolution SNP-array BeadChips (HumanOmni1-Quad, Illumina, USA). This chromosome region contains ten annotated genes, including GRK1, TFDP1, RASA3 and GAS6. To our knowledge, this represents the smallest 13q34 deletion identified to date. Our study provides additional support that distal 13q34 deletion region might contain key gene(s) responsible for cardiac development. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84883049635	576kb deletion in 1p36.33-p36.32 containing SKI is associated with limb malformation, congenital heart disease and epilepsy	1p36 deletion (monosomy 1p36) is one of the most common terminal deletions observed in humans, characterized by special facial features, mental retardation, heart defects, development delay and epilepsy. Previously, we reported molecular findings in patients with limb, congenital heart disease (CHD) and other malformations with SNP-array. In a syndromic patient of the same cohort, we detected a small deletion of 1p36.33-p36.32 containing SKI (Sloan-Kettering Institute protooncoprotein). Recently, dominant mutations in SKI were identified to be correlated with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Retrospective examination revealed this patient with limb malformations, CHD, epilepsy and mild development delay. Together with previous reports, our study suggests that the 1p36.33-1p36.32 deletion encompassing SKI may represents a previous undescribed microdeletion disorder. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84892411378	A derivative of chrysin suppresses two-stage skin carcinogenesis by inhibiting mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1	Mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that acts downstream of both extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to stress or mitogenic extracellular stimuli. Increasing evidence has shown that MSK1 is closely associated with malignant transformation and cancer development. MSK1 should be an effective target for cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy. However, very few MSK1 inhibitors, especially natural compounds, have been reported. We used virtual screening of a natural products database and the active conformation of the C-terminal kinase domain of MSK1 (PDB id 3KN) as the receptor structure to identify chrysin and its derivative, compound 69407, as inhibitors of MSK1. Compared with chrysin, compound 69407 more strongly inhibited proliferation and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells with lower cytotoxicity. Western blot data demonstrated that compound 69407 suppressed phosphorylation of the MSK1 downstream effector histone H3 in intact cells. Knocking down the expression of MSK1 effectively reduced the sensitivity of JB6 P+ cells to compound 69407. Moreover, topical treatment with compound 69407 before TPA application significantly reduced papilloma development in terms of number and size in a two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model. The reduction in papilloma development was accompanied by the inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 in tumors extracted from mouse skin. The results indicated that compound 69407 exerts inhibitory effects on skin tumorigenesis by directly binding with MSK1 and attenuates the MSK1/histone H3 signaling pathway, which makes it an ideal chemopreventive agent against skin cancer.©2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

84894238652	Regulation of Mcl-1 by constitutive activation of NF-kappaB contributes to cell viability in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells	Background: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies with a 5-year survival rate less than 15%. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ESCC becomes critical to develop more effective treatments.Methods: Mcl-1 expression was measured by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blotting. Human Mcl-1 promoter activity was evaluated by reporter gene assay. The interactions between DNA and transcription factors were confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in vitro and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in cells.Results: Four human ESCC cell lines, TE-1, Eca109, KYSE150 and KYSE510, are revealed increased levels of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein compare with HaCaT, an immortal non-tumorigenic cell line. Results of reporter gene assays demonstrate that human Mcl-1 promoter activity is decreased by mutation of kappaB binding site, specific NF-kappaB inhibitor Bay11-7082 or dominant inhibitory molecule DNMIkappaBalpha in TE-1 and KYSE150 cell lines. Mcl-1 protein level is also attenuated by Bay11-7082 treatment or co-transfection of DNMIkappaBalpha in TE-1 and KYSE150 cells. EMSA results indicate that NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 bind to human Mcl-1-kappaB probe in vitro. ChIP assay further confirm p50 and p65 directly bind to human Mcl-1 promoter in intact cells, by which regulates Mcl-1 expression and contributes to the viability of TE-1 cells.Conclusions: Our data provided evidence that one of the mechanisms of Mcl-1 expression in human ESCC is regulated by the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. The newly identified mechanism might provide a scientific basis for developing effective approaches to treatment human ESCC. © 2014 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84901297710	Rare de novo copy number variants in patients with congenital pulmonary atresia	Background: Ongoing studies using genomic microarrays and next-generation sequencing have demonstrated that the genetic contributions to cardiovascular diseases have been significantly ignored in the past. The aim of this study was to identify rare copy number variants in individuals with congenital pulmonary atresia (PA). Methods and Results: Based on the hypothesis that rare structural variants encompassing key genes play an important role in heart development in PA patients, we performed high-resolution genome-wide microarrays for copy number variations (CNVs) in 82 PA patient-parent trios and 189 controls with an Illumina SNP array platform. CNVs were identified in 17/82 patients (20.7%), and eight of these CNVs (9.8%) are considered potentially pathogenic. Five de novo CNVs occurred at two known congenital heart disease (CHD) loci (16p13.1 and 22q11.2). Two de novo CNVs that may affect folate and vitamin B

84904187561	Whole-exome sequencing identifies Y1495X of SCN5A to be associated with familial conduction disease and sudden death	SCN5A mutations have been reported to underlie a variety of inherited arrhythmias, while the complex overlapping phenotype, especially with congenital heart disease (CHD), is rarely reported. The 48-year-old proband underwent a recent syncope during rest. A CHD (tetralogy of Fallot) and conduction disease was revealed by echocardiogram and ultrasonic cardiogram examination. We combined whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics strategies to identify the pathogenic gene for this autosomal-dominant cardiac conduction disease (CCD) in a multi-generation pedigree. We examined four members of this family, including three affected and one unaffected. A novel nonsense mutation (Y1495X) in SCN5A was identified in the affected family members. This mutation is predicted to generate a truncated SCN5A protein, which could result in the loss of sodium current, a defined mechanism of SCN5A related arrhythmias. Our study provides evidence that WES is a highly effective approach for genetic analyses of rare clinical phenotypes. Our study also offers accurate genetic testing information for those yet clinically negative relatives.

11144357203	A mutation IVS2 + 1G > A in EXT2 gene causes hereditary multiple exostoses	Objective: To identify the gene causing hereditary multiple exostoses in a Chinese pedigree. Methods: Linkage analysis was carried out in the family using microsatellite markers on chromosome 8, 11 and 19 respectively. To detect the mutation, the whole coding sequence and the intron-exon boundaries of the candidate gene were amplified and sequenced. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to amplify the mutated mRNA. Results: The disease-causing gene of the family was linked to the EXT2 locus on chromosome 11. A mutation IVS2 + 1G > A was detected in EXT2 and resulting in 221 bp deletion from 316 to 536 of coding sequence (CDS), which was co-segregated with the disease phenotype. This change led to deletion from codon 106 to codon 178 and subsequent 2 nucleotides, producing a frameshift and truncated protein of 125 aa. Conclusion: The mutation IVS2 + IG > A is the disease-causing mutation in the Chinese pedigree with hereditary multiple exostoses.
