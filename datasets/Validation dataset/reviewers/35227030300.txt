33644549671	Search for higgs bosons decaying to bb̄ and produced in association with W bosons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a search for Higgs bosons decaying into bb̄ and produced in association with W bosons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV. This search uses 320pb-1 of the data set accumulated by the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab. Events are selected that have a high-transverse momentum electron or muon, missing transverse energy, and two jets, at least one of which is consistent with the hadronization of a b quark. Both the number of events and the dijet mass distribution are consistent with standard model background expectations, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio for the Higgs boson or any new particle with similar decay kinematics. These upper limits range from 10 pb for mH=110GeV/c2 to 3 pb for mH=150GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33644611398	Search for second-generation scalar leptoquarks in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	Results on a search for pair production of second-generation scalar leptoquark in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV are reported. The data analyzed were collected by the CDF detector during the 2002-2003 Tevatron Run II and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 198pb-1. Leptoquarks (LQ) are sought through their decay into (charged) leptons and quarks, with final state signatures represented by two muons and jets and one muon, large transverse missing energy and jets. We observe no evidence for LQ production and derive 95% C.L. upper limits on the LQ production cross sections as well as lower limits on their mass as a function of β, where β is the branching fraction for LQ→μq. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33644633956	Search for anomalous semileptonic decay of heavy flavor hadrons produced in association with a W boson at CDF II	We present a search for anomalous semileptonic decays of heavy flavor hadrons produced in association with a W boson in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV. We use 162pb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We select events with one W boson and at least one jet with an identified secondary vertex. In the jets with a secondary vertex we look for a semileptonic decay to a muon. We compare the number of jets with both a secondary vertex and a semileptonic decay and the kinematic properties of these jets, with the standard model expectation of W plus heavy flavor production and decay. No discrepancy is seen between the observation and the expectation, and we set limits on the production cross section of a B-like hadron with an anomalously high semileptonic branching ratio. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

32644474378	Precision top-quark mass measurement in the lepton+jets topology in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report two measurements of the top-quark mass Mtop using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron in a 318pb-1 data sample of tt̄ events in the lepton+jets final state. One method uses an event-based likelihood technique resulting in Mtop=173.2-2.4+2.6(stat)±3.2(syst)GeV/c2 or 173.2-4.0+4.1GeV/c2. The second method reconstructs a top-quark mass in each event using the measured invariant mass of the hadronically decaying W boson to constrain the jet energy scale to obtain a value for Mtop of 173.5-3.6+3.7(stat)±1.3(syst)GeV/c2 or 173.5-3.8+3.9GeV/c2.

33645827984	Top-quark mass measurement from dilepton events at CDF II	We report a measurement of the top-quark mass using events collected by the CDF II detector from pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron. We calculate a likelihood function for the top-quark mass in events that are consistent with tt ̄ → b̄ - ν̄ b ′+ν ′ decays. The likelihood is formed as the convolution of the leading-order matrix element and detector resolution functions. The joint likelihood is the product of likelihoods for each of 33 events collected in 340pb-1 of integrated luminosity, yielding a top-quark mass Mt=165.2±6.1(stat)±3.4(syst) GeV/c2. This first application of a matrix-element technique to tt ̄ →b +ν b ̄ ′-ν̄ ′ decays gives the most precise single measurement of Mt in dilepton events.

We analyze two quantities sensitive to the W helicity: the invariant mass of the charged lepton and the bottom-quark jet in the decay t→Wb→ νb (where =e or μ), and the transverse momentum of the charged lepton.

This is the first measurement which makes no explicit lepton identification requirements, so that sensitivity to W→τν decays is maintained. Heavy flavor jets from top quark decay are identified with a secondary vertex tagging algorithm. From 311pb-1 of data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab, we measure a production cross section of 5.8±1.2(stat)-0.7+0.9(syst)pb for a top quark mass of 178GeV/c2, in agreement with previous determinations and standard model predictions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33745080312	Measurement of the top quark mass using template methods on dilepton events in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We describe a measurement of the top quark mass from events produced in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV, using the Collider Detector at Fermilab. We identify tt̄ candidates where both W bosons from the top quarks decay into leptons (eν, μν, or τν) from a data sample of 360pb-1. The top quark mass is reconstructed in each event separately by three different methods, which draw upon simulated distributions of the neutrino pseudorapidity, tt̄ longitudinal momentum, or neutrino azimuthal angle in order to extract probability distributions for the top quark mass. For each method, representative mass distributions, or templates, are constructed from simulated samples of signal and background events, and parametrized to form continuous probability density functions. A likelihood fit incorporating these parametrized templates is then performed on the data sample masses in order to derive a final top quark mass. Combining the three template methods, taking into account correlations in their statistical and systematic uncertainties, results in a top quark mass measurement of 170.1±6.0(stat.)±4.1(syst.) GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646492293	Measurement of the top quark mass with the dynamical likelihood method using lepton plus jets events with b-tags in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This paper describes a measurement of the top quark mass, Mtop, with the dynamical likelihood method (DLM) using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The Tevatron produces top/antitop (tt̄) pairs in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The data sample used in this analysis was accumulated from March 2002 through August 2004, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 318pb-1. We use the tt̄ candidates in the "lepton+jets" decay channel, requiring at least one jet identified as a b quark by finding a displaced secondary vertex. The DLM defines a likelihood for each event based on the differential cross section as a function of Mtop per unit phase space volume of the final partons, multiplied by the transfer functions from jet to parton energies. The method takes into account all possible jet combinations in an event, and the likelihood is multiplied event by event to derive the top quark mass by the maximum likelihood method. Using 63 tt̄ candidates observed in the data, with 9.2 events expected from background, we measure the top quark mass to be 173.2+2.6-2.4(stat.)±3. 2(syst.)GeV/c2, or 173.2+4.1-4.0GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Using a data sample representing 344pb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab II experiment, we compare standard model predictions with the number of observed events for invariant masses between 50 and 800GeV/c2. Finding no significant excess (5 events observed vs 7.7±0.8 expected for Meμ>100GeV/c2), we set limits on sneutrino and Z′ masses as functions of lepton family number violating couplings. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

To identify the Z′→e+e- signal, both the dielectron invariant mass distribution and the angular distribution of the electron pair are used. No evidence of a signal is found, and 95% confidence level lower limits are set on the Z′ mass for several models.

Z bosons are identified in their electron and muon decay modes, and b jets with ET>20GeV and |η|<1.5 are identified by reconstructing a secondary decay vertex. The measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of about 330pb-1. A cross section times branching ratio of σ(Z+bjets)×B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-)=0.93±0.36pb is found, where B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-) is the branching ratio of the Z boson or γ* into a single flavor dilepton pair (e or μ) in the mass range between 66 and 116GeV/c2. The ratio of b jets to the total number of jets of any flavor in the Z sample, within the same kinematic range as the b jets, is 2.36±0.92%. Here, the uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. Predictions made with next-to-leading order QCD agree, within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, with these measurements. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The likelihood in top quark mass is calculated for each event by convoluting the leading order matrix element describing qq̄→tt̄→blνlb̄l′νl′ with detector resolution functions. The presence of background events in the data sample is modeled using similar calculations involving the matrix elements for major background processes. In a data sample with integrated luminosity of 340pb-1, we observe 33 candidate events and measure Mtop=165.2±6.1(stat.) ±3.4(syst.)GeV/c2.

The sample contains signals of 3600 fully reconstructed hadronic Bs decays and 37000 partially reconstructed semileptonic Bs decays. We measure the probability as a function of proper decay time that the Bs decays with the same, or opposite, flavor as the flavor at production, and we find a signal consistent with Bs0-B̄s0 oscillations. The probability that random fluctuations could produce a comparable signal is 0.2%. Under the hypothesis that the signal is due to Bs0-B̄s0 oscillations, we measure Δms=17.31-0.18+0.33(stat)±0. 07(syst)ps-1 and determine |Vtd/Vts|=0.208-0.002+0.001(expt)-0.006+0.008(theor). © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33750051602	Measurement of the tt̄ production cross section in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using lepton+jets events with jet probability b-tagging	We present a measurement of the tt̄ production cross section using events with one charged lepton and jets from pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. A b-tagging algorithm based on the probability of displaced tracks coming from the event interaction vertex is applied to identify b quarks from top decay. Using 318pb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector, we measure the tt̄ production cross section in events with at least one restrictive (tight) b-tagged jet and obtain 8.9-1.0+1.0(stat)-1.0+1.1(syst)pb. The cross section value assumes a top quark mass of mt=178GeV/c2 in the acceptance corrections. The dependence of the cross section on mt is presented in the paper. This result is consistent with other CDF measurements of the tt̄ cross section using different samples and analysis techniques, and has similar systematic uncertainties. We have also performed consistency checks by using the b-tagging probability function to vary the signal-to-background ratio and also using events that have at least two b-tagged jets. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

34147141823	Measurement of the top quark mass in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using the decay length technique	We report the first measurement of the top quark mass using the decay length technique in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. This technique uses the measured flight distance of the b hadron to infer the mass of the top quark in lepton plus jets events with missing transverse energy. It relies solely on tracking and avoids the jet energy scale uncertainty that is common to all other methods used so far. We apply our novel method to a 695pb-1 data sample recorded by the CDF II detector at Fermilab and extract a measurement of mt=180.7-13.4+15.5(stat.)±8.6(syst.)GeV/c2. While the uncertainty of this result is larger than that of other measurements, the dominant uncertainties in the decay length technique are uncorrelated with those in other methods.

Within the framework of an R-parity-violating supergravity model, the results are interpreted as mass limits on the lightest neutralino (χ 10) and chargino (χ1±) particles. For one particular choice of model parameters, the limits are M(χ10)>110GeV/c2 and M(χ1±)>203GeV/c2 at 95% confidence level; the variation of these mass limits with model parameters is presented. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34247351071	Observation of WZ production	We report the first observation of the associated production of a W boson and a Z boson. This result is based on 1.1fb-1 of integrated luminosity from pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We observe 16 WZ candidates passing our event selection with an expected background of 2.7±0.4 events. A fit to the missing transverse energy distribution indicates an excess of events compared to the background expectation corresponding to a significance equivalent to 6 standard deviations. The measured cross section is σ(pp̄→WZ)=5.0-1.6+1.8pb, consistent with the standard model expectation. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34047256587	Measurement of the top-quark mass in all-hadronic decays in pp̄ collisions at CDF II	We present a measurement of the top-quark mass Mtop in the all-hadronic decay channel tt̄→W+bW-b̄→q1q̄2bq3q̄4b̄. The analysis is performed using 310pb-1 of s=1.96TeV pp̄ collisions collected with the CDF II detector using a multijet trigger. The mass measurement is based on an event-by-event likelihood which depends on both the sample purity and the value of the top-quark mass, using 90 possible jet-to-parton assignments in the six-jet final state. The joint likelihood of 290 selected events yields a value of Mtop=177.1±4.9(stat)±4.7(syst)GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34347383743	Measurement of the top-quark mass using missing ET+jets events with secondary vertex b-tagging at CDF II	We present a measurement of the top-quark mass in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV which uses events with an inclusive signature of missing transverse energy and jets. The event selection is sensitive to tt̄→W+bW- b̄→lνbqq′b̄ independent of the lepton flavor and results in a large acceptance for W→τν decays. All-hadronic tt̄ decays and events with identified electrons or muons are vetoed to provide a statistically independent sample with respect to all previous measurements. The top-quark mass is inferred from the distribution of the scalar sum of all jet transverse energies and the missing transverse energy. Using 311pb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab, we measure a top-quark mass mt=172.3-9.6+10.8(stat)±10.8(syst)GeV/c2. While the uncertainty on mt is larger than that of other measurements, the result is statistically uncorrelated with those of other methods and thus can help to reduce the overall mt uncertainty when combined with other existing measurements. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We use a channel with one hadronically-decaying and one electronically-decaying tau. This measurement is based on 350pb-1 of CDF Run II data. Using a sample of 504 opposite sign eτ events with a total expected background of 190 events, we obtain σ(pp̄→4Z)•B(Z→ττ)=264±23(stat) ±14(syst)±15(lumi)pb, in agreement with the next-to-next-to- leading order QCD prediction.

The measurements are carried out in five different jet rapidity regions with |yjet|<2.1 and transverse momentum in the range 54<pTjet<700GeV/c.

34347399593	Search for new physics in lepton+photon+X events with 929pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present results of a search at CDF in 929±56pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at 1.96 TeV for the anomalous production of events containing a high-transverse momentum charged lepton (ℓ, either e or μ) and photon (γ), accompanied by missing transverse energy (E T), and/or additional leptons and photons, and jets (X). We use the same selection criteria as in a previous CDF Run I search, but with an order-magnitude larger data set, a higher pp̄ collision energy, and the CDF II detector. We find 163 ℓγE T+X events, compared to an expectation of 150.6±13.0 events. We observe 74 ℓγ+X events, compared to an expectation of 65.1±7.7 events. We find no events similar to the Run I eeγγE T event. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We measure σ×B=2796±13(stat)-90+95(syst)±162(lum)pb. Combining this result with a previous CDF measurement obtained using electrons in the central region (|η| 1), we present the first measurement of the ratio of central-electron to forward-electron W partial cross sections Rexp=0.925±0.006(stat)±0.032(syst), consistent with theoretical predictions using Coordinated Theoretical-Experimental Project on QCD (CTEQ) and Martin-Roberts-Stirling-Thorne (MRST) parton distribution functions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

Many extensions to the standard model predict the production of two leptons of the same electric charge. This search has a significant increase in sensitivity compared to earlier searches. Using a data sample corresponding to 1fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the CDF II detector, we observe no significant excess in an inclusive selection (expect 33.2±4.7 events, observe 44) or in a supersymmetry-optimized selection (expect 7.8±1.1 events, observe 13.) © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34548753335	Search for heavy long-lived particles that decay to photons at CDF II	We present the first search for heavy, long-lived particles that decay to photons at a hadron collider. We use a sample of Î+jet+missing transverse energy events in pp collisions at s=1.96 TeV taken with the CDF II detector. Candidate events are selected based on the arrival time of the photon at the detector. Using an integrated luminosity of 570pb-1 of collision data, we observe 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3 0.7 events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we set cross section limits in a supersymmetric model with I E 10 GE and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower limit on the Ï‡Ëœ10 mass of 101 GeV/c2 at Ï.,Ï‡Ëœ10=5ns. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34848878629	Polarizations of J/ψ and ψ(2S) mesons produced in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We have measured the polarizations of J/ψ and ψ(2S) mesons as functions of their transverse momentum pT when they are produced promptly in the rapidity range |y|<0.6 with pT 5GeV/c. The analysis is performed using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about 800pb-1 collected by the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizations become increasingly longitudinal as pT increases from 5 to 30GeV/c. These results are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of J/ψ and ψ(2S) mesons from B-hadron decays are also reported. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35948994597	Precise measurement of the top-quark mass in the lepton+jets topology at CDF II	We present a measurement of the mass of the top quark from proton-antiproton collisions recorded at the CDF experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron. We analyze events from the single lepton plus jets final state (tt̄→W+bW-b̄→lνbqq̄′b̄). The top-quark mass is extracted using a direct calculation of the probability density that each event corresponds to the tt̄ final state. The probability is a function of both the mass of the top quark and the energy scale of the calorimeter jets, which is constrained in situ by the hadronic W boson mass. Using 167 events observed in 955pb-1 of integrated luminosity, we achieve the single most precise measurement of the top-quark mass, 170.8±2.2(stat.) ±1.4(syst.)GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35448931078	Search for new particles leading to Z+jets final states in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present the results of a search for new particles that lead to a Z boson plus jets in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II). A data sample with a luminosity of 1.06fb-1 collected using Z boson decays to ee and μμ is used. We describe a completely data-based method to predict the dominant background from standard model Z+jet events. This method can be similarly applied to other analyses requiring background predictions in multijet environments, as shown when validating the method by predicting the background from W+jets in tt̄ production. No significant excess above the background prediction is observed, and a limit is set using a fourth generation quark model to quantify the acceptance. Assuming BR(b′→bZ)=100% and using a leading-order calculation of the b′ cross section, b′ quark masses below 268GeV/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We find the diphoton mass spectrum to be in agreement with the standard model expectation, and set limits on the cross section times branching ratio for the Randall-Sundrum graviton, as a function of diphoton mass. We subsequently derive lower limits for the graviton mass of 230GeV/c2 and 850GeV/c2, at the 95% confidence level, for coupling parameters (k/M̄Pl) of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

No significant evidence of such a resonance is observed and we interpret the results to exclude the standard-model-like Z′ with a mass below 923GeV/c2 and the Randall-Sundrum graviton with a mass below 807GeV/c2 for k/M̄pl=0.1, both at the 95% confidence level.

35548967881	Searches for direct pair production of supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We search for direct pair production of supersymmetric top quarks and supersymmetric bottom quarks in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV, using 295pb-1 of data recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) experiment. The supersymmetric top (supersymmetric bottom) quarks are selected by reconstructing their decay into a charm (bottom) quark and a neutralino, which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. The signature of such processes is two energetic heavy-flavor jets and missing transverse energy. The number of events that pass our selection for each search process is consistent with the expected standard model background. By comparing our results to the theoretical production cross sections of the supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, we exclude, at a 95% confidence level in the frame of that model, a supersymmetric top quark mass up to 132GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 48GeV/c2, and a supersymmetric bottom quark mass up to 193GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 40GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35649013874	Measurement of the pp̄→tt̄ production cross section and the top quark mass at s=1.96TeV in the all-hadronic decay mode	We report the measurements of the tt̄ production cross section and of the top quark mass using 1.02fb-1 of pp̄ data collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We select events with six or more jets on which a number of kinematical requirements are imposed by means of a neural network algorithm. At least one of these jets must be identified as initiated by a b-quark candidate by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The cross section is measured to be σtt̄=8.3±1.0(stat)-1.5+2.0(syst) ±0.5(lumi)pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. The top quark mass of 174.0±2.2(stat)±4.8(syst)GeV/c2 is derived from a likelihood fit incorporating reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and background. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The event signature requires two electromagnetic showers, each with transverse energy ET>5GeV and pseudorapidity |η|<1.0, with no other particles detected in the event. Three candidate events are observed. We discuss the consistency of the three events with γγ, π0π0, or ηη production. The probability that other processes fluctuate to 3 events is 1.7×10-4.

In this search one W decays to leptons, and the other boson (W or Z) decays hadronically.

33244465223	Top quark mass measurement using the template method in the lepton+jets channel at CDF II	This article presents a measurement of the top quark mass using the CDF II detector at Fermilab. Colliding beams of protons and antiprotons at Fermilab's Tevatron (s=1.96TeV) produce top/antitop pairs, which decay to W+W-bb̄; events are selected where one W decays to hadrons and the other W decays to either e or μ plus a neutrino. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 318pb-1. A total of 165 tt̄ events are separated into four subsamples based on jet transverse energy thresholds and the number of b jets identified by reconstructing a displaced vertex. In each event, the reconstructed top quark invariant mass is determined by minimizing a χ2 for the overconstrained kinematic system. At the same time, the mass of the hadronically decaying W boson is measured in the same event sample. The observed W boson mass provides an in situ improvement in the determination of the hadronic jet energy scale. A simultaneous likelihood fit of the reconstructed top quark masses and the W boson invariant masses in the data sample to distributions from simulated signal and background events gives a top quark mass of 173.5-3.8+3.9GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33644951561	Measurement of the dipion mass spectrum in X(3872)→J/ψπ+π- decays	We measure the dipion mass spectrum in X(3872)→J/ψπ+π- decays using 360pb-1 of p̄p collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the CDFÂ II detector. The spectrum is fit with predictions for odd C-parity (S13, P11, and DJ3) charmonia decaying to J/ψπ+π-, as well as even C-parity states in which the pions are from ρ0 decay. The latter case also encompasses exotic interpretations, such as a D0D̄*0 molecule. Only the S13 and J/ψρ hypotheses are compatible with our data. Since S13 is untenable on other grounds, decay via J/ψρ is favored, which implies C=+1 for the X(3872). Models for different J/ψ-ρ angular momenta L are considered. Flexibility in the models, especially the introduction of ρ-ω interference, enables good descriptions of our data for both L=0 and 1. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

We observe no evidence for this decay mode and set limits on the production cross section times branching fraction, assuming the neutrinos from W′ boson decays to be light.
