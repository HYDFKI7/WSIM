16244397117	Study of Low Sidelobe Time Modulated Linear Antenna Arrays at Millimeter-Waves	In this paper, the time modulation technique for the design of low sidelobe antenna arrays is extended to millimeter-wave frequency band. Millimeter-wave rectangular waveguide is selected as the element radiators of linear antenna arrays, and the element radiation patterns are taken into account in the analysis and design of low sidelobe time modulated linear arrays. Two types of time modulation, namely, the time modulated variable aperture sizes (VAS) and unidirectional phase center motion (UPCM), are implemented in the design of low sidelobe millimeter waveguide linear arrays. It is observed that both the co-polarized and the cross-polarized components will experience the time modulation effect simultaneously.

19144362044	Linear antenna arrays with bidirectional phase center motion	The theoretical and experimental studies of linear antenna arrays with bidirectional phase center motion (BPCM) is presented. BPCM is achieved by exciting only part of the linear array elements and sweeping the excited part from one end to the other and back. The sidelobes of the linear arrays with BPCM experience both upper and lower Doppler frequency shift effect in turn, as compared to linear arrays with unidirectional phase center motion (UPCM). Numerical results show that linear arrays with BPCM are also capable of synthesizing low/ultralow sidelobes, but with a much lower excitation dynamic range ratio as compared to that in conventional arrays. In addition, some characteristics, such as passband bandwidth or sideband levels, are better than those of arrays with UPCM or time modulated variable aperture size arrays. An L-band 16-element printed dipole linear array with BPCM was designed. Experimental results show that a -35 dB relative sidelobe level (SLL) can be achieved. © 2005 IEEE.

27744457627	Time modulated planar arrays with square lattices and circular boundaries	The time modulation approach is extended to planar antenna arrays with square lattices and circular boundaries to synthesize ultra-low sidelobe patterns. Time modulation is achieved by switching on-off each of the array elements in pre-determined sequences, thus introducing an additional degree of design freedom to reduce the dynamic-range ratio and error tolerance requirements. The generalized Tseng-Cheng distributions, which generate axis-symmetric patterns in all ø-cuts for planar arrays with square lattices and boundaries, are utilized in the synthesis of time modulated planar arrays. The sideband levels of the time modulated planar arrays are effectively suppressed by utilizing the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Numerical results show that ultra-low sidelobes can be synthesized for time modulated planar arrays, with very low dynamic-range ratio, low sideband levels and minimal reduction in directivity.

Taking into account the personal flow, the investigation of indoor MIMO wireless channel model was extended. The proposed channel model performance was validated by experimental results. Valuable conclusions were obtained from the study: A reasonable explanation was obtained for the decrease of pinhole channel capacity in low rank channel. Neglecting the relative path loss and shadowing fading, channel capacity increases as the number of antenna increases or the correlation of signal decreases in high rank channel. Moreover, when the relative path loss and shadowing fading are considered, a much higher channel capacity can be obtained in the line-of-sight propagation environment with rich scatters.

The numerical simulation results show that channel capacity will be affected by fading severity and diversity performance. For the same SNR, two kinds of fading channel capacity increase as the fading severity increases. Moreover, the fading severity affects the channel capacity more on the Weibull fading channel capacity than on Nakagami fading channel. For the same fading severity and the same SNR, the optimum capacity of the channel with selective diversity is higher than that without selective diversity. Optimized switch threshold is obtained in the Weibull fading channel by using switch stay combining technology.

The optimized time sequences and element excitations are obtained by the method based on a combination of a differential evolution strategy (DES) and a modified 2D Woodward-Lawson method. Normally, planar array synthesis is rather time consuming, partly due to the inherently large number of optimization variables and partly due to the fact that the calculation of fitness function is also time consuming. A fast computation approach based on the 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT) is thus applied in the DES for the planar array pattern computation.

84860700526	Improving conflicting specifications of time-modulated antenna arrays by using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm	By using the time modulation technique in antenna arrays, the stringent requirements on excitation error tolerance can be relaxed. However, the sideband signals spaced at multiples of the modulation frequency need to be suppressed in some applications. Multiobjective optimization is an important tool in the design of arrays with conflicting goals, such as low sidelobe level, low sideband level, and narrow beamwidth in the time-modulated antenna arrays. In this paper, a novel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on objective decomposition (MOEA/D) with differential evolution operator and objective normalization technique is employed for the time-modulated array synthesis, which is typically a problem with disparately scaled conflicting objectives. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by comparing the performances obtained by MOEA/D with those of previously reported results obtained by a single-objective differential evolution algorithm and simulated annealing technique.

The approach is based on the combination of the active element patterns and the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Different from linear and circular arrays, the mutual coupling compensation in a planar array is more complicated since it requires numerous data of the active element patterns in different azimuth planes. In order to solve this problem, a useful interface program is developed to get these data from commercial software HFSS automatically. Also different from conventional low sidelobe arrays with tapered amplitude excitations, the low sidelobe in the 4D array is realized using time-modulation technique under uniform static amplitude and phase conditions. The DE algorithm is used to optimize the time sequences which are equivalent to the complex excitations in conventional arrays. Both computed results and simulated results in HFSS show that a -30 dB sidelobe pattern can be synthesized in a 76-element planar array with an octagonal ground plane and a radome, thus verifying the proposed approach.

84894218263	Directional modulation based on 4-D antenna arrays	Four-dimensional (4-D) antenna arrays are formed by introducing a fourth dimension, time, into traditional antenna arrays. In this paper, a time-modulated 4-D array with constant instantaneous directivity is proposed for directional modulation. The main idea is that the 4-D array transmits correct signal without time modulation in the desired direction, while transmitting time-modulated signals in other directions. As longs as the time modulation frequency is less than the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, the time-modulated signals cannot be demodulated correctly due to the aliasing effect, implying that time-modulated signals go distorted. Thus, the 4-D array can be used to transmit direction-dependent signals in secure wireless communications. The proposed idea is verified by experiments based on AM signal transmission through the 4-D array. Moreover, BPSK signal transmission through the 4-D array is studied and the bit error rate (BER) performance is investigated. Simulation results show that the BERs of time-modulated BPSK (TM-BPSK) signals transmitted through the sidelobes of the 4-D array are much higher than those of BPSK signals and almost keep unchanged even under higher SNR. Finally, two enhanced methods are presented to improve the feasibility of directional modulation by using random time sequences and random time modulation frequency. © 2013 IEEE.

84896339981	4-D arrays as enabling technology for cognitive radio systems	Time-modulation (TM) in four-dimensional (4-D) arrays is implemented by using a set of radio-frequency switches in the beam forming network to modulate, by means of periodic pulse sequences, the static excitations and thus control the antenna radiation features. The on-off reconfiguration of the switches, that can be easily implemented via software, unavoidably generates harmonic radiations that can be suitably exploited for multiple channel communication purposes. As a matter of fact, harmonic beams can be synthesized having different spatial distribution and shapes in order to receive signals arriving on the antenna from different directions. Similarly, the capability to generate a field having different frequency and spatial distribution implies that the signal transmitted by time-modulated 4-D arrays is direction-dependent. Accordingly, such a feature is also exploited to implement a secure communication scheme directly at the physical layer. Thanks to the easy software-based reconfigurability, the multiple harmonic beamforming, and the security capability, 4-D arrays can be considered as an enabling technology for future cognitive radio systems. In this paper, these potentialities of time-modulated 4-D arrays are presented and their effectiveness is supported by a set of representative numerical simulation results. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

Simulation results of the DOA estimation with an 8-element time-modulated linear array (TMLA) are presented which show the proposed method has better performance than conventional uniform linear array (ULA). Moreover, an experiment of DOA estimation based on TMLA is carried out to give a further verification of the application of TMAA in DOA estimation.

84908636614	A phase-comparison monopulse system based on a 4D antenna array	Conventional monopulse systems based on sum and difference patterns produced by traditional arrays face the contradiction of angle-resolution and angle-searching range, and a compromise between them usually has to be made. In four-dimensional (4D) antenna arrays, multiple pairs of sum and difference patterns can be produced simultaneously at the center frequency and low sidebands. By designing the time sequences reasonably, the multiple sum and difference patterns point in different directions, covering a much wider angle-range. In this paper, the conventional phase-comparison monopulse is introduced into a 4D array to form a novel monopulse system by which both high angle-resolution and wide angel-searching range are realized. Theoretical analysis shows that the novel monopulse system covers a ±60° angle-searching range without beam-scanning. An experiment system based on an 8-element 4D array is established, and measurement results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

84914692815	Novel parasitic micro strip arrays for low-cost active phased array applications	In this paper, a novel idea is proposed to construct low-cost phased arrays by using the multi-port property of array elements. The operating principles are illustrated and explained in detail. A three-element patch subarray with a periodic lattice is conceived according to the proposed idea. In the subarray, one patch antenna with multiple ports is designed as an active element which is directly fed through the excitation port by a feeding network. The other two parasitic patches are fed by the coupling ports of the active element. Good agreements between simulations and measurements of a two-subarray phased array prototype successfully verify the proposed idea. Then, comparisons to a conventional phased array are performed to highlight its advantages, e.g., high aperture efficiency and low cost. Finally, a second design example is given for more references. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

84921389537	4D-arrays for MIMO radar applications	A novel approach for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar applications is proposed, namely four-dimensional orthogonal frequency (4D-OF), which applies the technique of four-dimensional arrays (4D-arrays) and frequency stepping. The sidebands of the 4D array are utilized to generate multiple orthogonal carrier frequencies and transmit signals. The time sequences are optimized by the differential evolution (DE) algorism to synthesize a desired radiation pattern with a better directivity compared to frequency division MIMO. A linear FM (LFM) pulse signal is input to the 4D array and is spread at the center frequency and a few sidebands in the same direction. An analytic expression for the cross correlation function of these sideband signals is presented to study the relationship between pulse duration and time-modulated frequency. Without the use of numerical mixers, the 4D-OF is a good candidate for the MIMO radar. Some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
