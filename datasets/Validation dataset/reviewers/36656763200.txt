33744941096	A packet property-based task scheduling policy for control plane OS in NP-based applications	In NP-based networking elements, there are various kinds of packet traffic between data plane and control plane, which have different priorities and are handled by different tasks running on control plane OS. The critical packets need to be processed in time, otherwise the system, even the network, may enter some unstable states. Thus, the packets should be processed according to their priorities, i.e., packet-processing tasks for more important packets should be executed sooner if they are both in ready state. From the perspective of control plane OS design, packet-processing tasks should be scheduled based on some properties of packets waiting to be processed. This paper proposes a packet property-based task scheduling policy to alleviate the problem. The design and implementation are described and the performance results are discussed. The results show that this scheduling policy can achieve our design goal properly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

34748912937	Local tax rebates, corporate tax burdens, and firm migration: Evidence from China	Conflicts of interest between local governments and the central administration in China have yielded many local policies that only serve the interests of local governments. The policy of first levying and then rebating taxes is an example of how local governments eschew the national tax regulations to boost local economies rather than national interests. In 2001, the Chinese government announced the termination of local tax rebates, which had some expected outcomes. We find that local governments complied with the new tax policy even though it no longer allowed local governments to grant tax incentives. However, some companies found ways to avoid the greater tax burdens by moving their business registration locations to tax havens. We also find that firms controlled by local governments were less likely to change registration locations. Our study examines the national tax regulation in China and explores how tax rules influence company decisions. In addition, we show that non-tax incentives, such as local economic development, may also influence company decisions. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

80052887241	Hierarchical anatomical brain networks for MCI prediction by partial least square analysis	Owning to its clinical accessibility, T1-weighted MRI has been extensively studied for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The tissue volumes of GM, WM and CSF are the most commonly used measures for MCI and AD prediction. We note that disease-induced structural changes may not happen at isolated spots, but in several inter-related regions. Therefore, in this paper we propose to directly extract the inter-region connectivity based features for MCI prediction. This involves constructing a brain network for each subject, with each node representing an ROI and each edge representing regional interactions. This network is also built hierarchically to improve the robustness of classification. Compared with conventional methods, our approach produces a significant larger pool of features, which if improperly dealt with, will result in intractability when used for classifier training. Therefore based on the characteristics of the network features, we employ Partial Least Square analysis to efficiently reduce the feature dimensionality to a manageable level while at the same time preserving discriminative information as much as possible. Our experiment demonstrates that without requiring any new information in addition to T1-weighted images, the prediction accuracy of MCI is statistically improved. © 2011 IEEE.

In this paper, the extraction is simplified by edge tracking with adding some constraints which ensure the edge be linked near to the line. It is a strategy that made a feasible way to obtain lines. Following edge detecting, the proposed approach obtains lines by tracking edge with priority direction, inertia tracking, judging and rectifying linear relation real-time. After such constraints on the tracking process, the edge is linked to a line. Experiments show varied results of proposed approach and the contrast to Hough transform, and it can be seen that the line extracted is more effective than latter. ©2007 IEEE.

Since the simulation results based on existing mobile models may not correctly reflect the true MANET performance, a novel circle-movement mobility model (CMM) and its topology inference algorithm are presented. Although MANET topology is dynamic during simulation, it is relatively stable during each identifiable time.

We study the frequencies and magnitudes of earnings management under two different thresholds, zero earnings and prior earnings, in the Chinese market from 1997 to 2004. We model earnings as a mixed-normal distribution and obtain parameter estimators that measure the frequency and magnitude of earnings management. We show that the practice of earnings management has gone up both in frequency and magnitude during the post-2000 period. We also find that the frequency and magnitude of earnings management are higher when firms try to avoid negative earnings than when firms try to report earnings increase. Our findings reflect the current economic environment in China and caution investors on the low-disclosure quality in the Chinese stock market.

67649834034	Influence of nose-perturbation location on behavior of vortical flow around slender body at high incidence	Response of the vortical flow around a slender body of revolution at high incidence to the shift of a single nose perturbation was investigated systematically using numerical methods. A minute geometric bump was employed to act as the nose perturbation, and all computations were performed for subsonic flows at incidence of 50°. The computational results show that the vortical flow is more sensitive to the perturbation located axially closer to the nose apex of a slender body. With perturbation shifting axially downstream away from nose apex, there is a critical axial location appearing. The vortical flow is less sensitive to the perturbation located axially closer to the critical axial location; when perturbation traverses axially around the critical axial location, the vortical flow switches between opposite asymmetric patterns. The eventual influence of perturbation axial location on the vortical flow lies on both its relative locations to nose apex and the critical axial location. The vortical flow is more sensitive to the perturbation located circumferentially farther away from the fore-and-aft symmetric plane of a slender body, and just the asymmetrically-located perturbation can provoke the vortical flow to asymmetry. With perturbation shifting circumferentially in sequence, the vortical flow varies by degrees in manner of a single periodicity. A convective-type of instability existing in the flow field is responsible for the influence of nose perturbation on the vortical flow. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

70349671305	Shape-preserving interpolation and smoothing for options market implied volatility	The interpolation of the market implied volatility function from several observations of option prices is often required in financial practice and empirical study. However, the results from existing interpolation methods may not satisfy the property that the European call option price function is monotonically decreasing and convex with respect to the strike price. In this paper, a modified convex interpolation method (with and without smoothing) is developed to approximate the option price function while explicitly incorporating the shape restrictions. The method is optimal for minimizing the distance between the implied risk-neutral density function and a prior density function, which allows us to benefit from nonparametric methodology and empirical experience. Numerical performance shows that the method is accurate and robust. Whether or not the sample satisfies the convexity and decreasing constraints, the method always works. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

70449112645	A novel mobility model based on semi-random circular movement in mobile ad hoc networks	When simulating a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), it is important to use a realistic mobility model to reflect the actual performance of a mobile system. The spatial distribution of node locations in a mobile model plays a key role when investigating the characteristics of a MANET. However, most existing mobility models with random and simple straight line movement lead to unrealistic scenarios and non-uniform distributions, and can not describe the actual movement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) connected via a MANET. To address this issue, a novel mobility model based on semi-random circular movement (SRCM) is presented. The approximate node distribution function in SRCM is derived within a 2D disk region. The relationship between application performance and node distribution is investigated for a UAV MANET, with focus on scan coverage and network connectivity. A simulation using the NS2 tool is conducted. It is shown that the presented model with a uniform distribution performs better than the popular Random Waypoint mobility model. The SRCM model with the NS2 simulator provides a realistic way for simulation and performance evaluation of UAV MANETs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A problem of this kind emerges when one wants to infer the momentum distribution of the neutral pions by detecting the π0 decay photons using the photon spectrometer of the ALICE LHC experiment at CERN [1]. The underlying integral equation connecting the sought for pion spectrum and the measured gamma spectrum has been discretized and subsequently reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations. The latter system, however, is known to be ill-posed and must be regularized to obtain a stable solution. This task has been accomplished here by means of the Tikhonov regularization scheme combined with the L-curve method. The resulting pion spectrum is in an excellent quantitative agreement with the pion spectrum obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The simulation results show that the bullet in the magazine can turn 90 degrees and feed timely, the bullet can be fed into the magazine successfully, and the motion is concordant. The ammunition feeding motion is analyzed when the magazine has a small angle offset. The route to push ammunition is obtained finally. The feasibility of the horizontal high-capacity magazine is verified.

78349238143	Consistent 4D cortical thickness measurement for longitudinal neuroimaging study	Accurate and reliable method for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex provides powerful tool for diagnosing and studying of a variety of neuro-degenerative and psychiatric disorders. In these studies, capturing the subtle longitudinal changes of cortical thickness during pathological or physiological development is of great importance. For this purpose, in this paper, we propose a 4D cortical thickness measuring method. Different from the existing temporal-independent methods, our method fully utilizes the 4D information given by temporal serial images. Therefore, it is much more resistant to noises from the imaging and pre-processing steps. The experiments on longitudinal image datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that our method significantly improves the longitudinal stability, i.e. temporal consistency, in cortical thickness measurement, which is crucial for longitudinal study. Power analysis of the correlation between cortical thickness and Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) score demonstrated that our method generates statistically more significant results when comparing with the 3D temporal-independent thickness measuring methods. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78650141591	High pt and photon physics with ALICE at LHC	ALICE, A Large Ion Collider Experiment, is dedicated to study the QCD matter at extreme high temperature and density to understand the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and phase transition. High-transversemomentum photons and neutral mesons from the initial hard scattering of partons can be measured with ALICE calorimeters, PHOS (PHOton Spectrometer) and EMCAL (ElectroMagnetic CALorimeter). Combing the additional central tracking detectors, the γy-jet and π°-jet measurements thus can be accessed. These measurements offer us a sensitive tomography probe of the hot-dense medium generated in the heavy ion collisions.

78650597800	Suppression of charged particle production at large transverse momentum in central Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV	Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The data are presented for central and peripheral collisions, corresponding to 0-5% and 70-80% of the hadronic Pb-Pb cross section. The measured charged particle spectra in |n|<0.8 and 0.3<pT<20 GeV/c are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same sNN, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor RAA. The result indicates only weak medium effects (RAA≈0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, RAA reaches a minimum of about 0.14 at pT=6-7 GeV/c and increases significantly at larger pT. The measured suppression of high- pT particles is stronger than that observed at lower collision energies, indicating that a very dense medium is formed in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. © 2010 CERN.

78751485887	Front-end electronics for the ALICE calorimeters	The ALICE calorimeters PHOS and EMCal are based on Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD) photosensors with Charge Sensitive Preamplifiers (CSP) for readout of the scintillating elements. The amplified signals are read out via 32-channel shaper/digitizer front-end electronics (FEE) with 14-bit effective dynamic range. The electronics is based on second order shapers with dual gain for each channel, getting digitized by ALTRO chips. Each APD channel is equipped with an individual 10-bit APD gain adjustment and 2×2 channel clusters generate a 100 ns shaped analog sums output (Fast OR) for the associated Trigger Region Units (TRU). The Fast OR signals are generated by first order shapers with a dynamic range of 12-bit given by the ADC in the TRU cards. Board controller firmware in the FPGA provides local monitoring and configuration of all parameters via the ALICE DCS system. The signal to noise ratio for MIP at 215 MeV is ∼7 per channel with a noise level of 30MeV at room temperature for a dynamic range of 80GeV for PHOS, and the fast-OR RMS noise level is about 75 MeV for a dynamic range of 250 GeV for EMCal. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

79251609952	Level-0 trigger algorithms for the ALICE PHOS detector	The PHOS level-0 trigger provides a minimum bias trigger for pp collisions and information for a level-1 trigger at both pp and PbPb collisions. There are two level-0 trigger generating algorithms under consideration: the Direct Comparison algorithm and the Weighted Sum algorithm. In order to study trigger algorithms via simulation, a simplified equivalent model is extracted from the trigger electronics to derive the waveform function of the Analog-or signal as input to the trigger algorithms. Simulations shown that the Weighted Sum algorithm can achieve higher trigger efficiency and provide more precise single channel energy information than the direct compare algorithm. An energy resolution of 9.75 MeV can be achieved with the Weighted Sum algorithm at a sampling rate of 40 Msps (mega samples per second) at 1 GeV. The timing performance at a sampling rate of 40 Msps with the Weighted Sum algorithm is better than that at a sampling rate of 20 Msps with both algorithms. The level-0 trigger can be delivered to ALICE CTP within 800 ns with a timing uncertainty of 2 LHC bunch crossing cycles. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79952073234	Multimodal classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment	Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), has attracted more and more attention recently. So far, multiple biomarkers have been shown to be sensitive to the diagnosis of AD and MCI, i.e., structural MR imaging (MRI) for brain atrophy measurement, functional imaging (e.g., FDG-PET) for hypometabolism quantification, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for quantification of specific proteins. However, most existing research focuses on only a single modality of biomarkers for diagnosis of AD and MCI, although recent studies have shown that different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of AD and MCI. In this paper, we propose to combine three modalities of biomarkers, i.e., MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers, to discriminate between AD (or MCI) and healthy controls, using a kernel combination method. Specifically, ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 51. AD patients, 99 MCI patients (including 43 MCI converters who had converted to AD within 18. months and 56 MCI non-converters who had not converted to AD within 18. months), and 52 healthy controls are used for development and validation of our proposed multimodal classification method. In particular, for each MR or FDG-PET image, 93 volumetric features are extracted from the 93 regions of interest (ROIs), automatically labeled by an atlas warping algorithm. For CSF biomarkers, their original values are directly used as features. Then, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to evaluate the classification accuracy, using a 10-fold cross-validation. As a result, for classifying AD from healthy controls, we achieve a classification accuracy of 93.2% (with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 93.3%) when combining all three modalities of biomarkers, and only 86.5% when using even the best individual modality of biomarkers. Similarly, for classifying MCI from healthy controls, we achieve a classification accuracy of 76.4% (with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 66%) for our combined method, and only 72% even using the best individual modality of biomarkers. Further analysis on MCI sensitivity of our combined method indicates that 91.5% of MCI converters and 73.4% of MCI non-converters are correctly classified. Moreover, we also evaluate the classification performance when employing a feature selection method to select the most discriminative MR and FDG-PET features. Again, our combined method shows considerably better performance, compared to the case of using an individual modality of biomarkers. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79955473766	Sex differences in grey matter atrophy patterns among AD and aMCI patients: Results from ADNI	We used longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to determine whether there are any gender differences in grey matter atrophy patterns over time in 197 individuals with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 266 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), compared with 224 healthy controls participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). While previous research has differentiated probable AD and aMCI groups from controls in brain atrophy, it is unclear whether and how sex plays a role in patterns of change over time. Using regional volumetric maps, we fit longitudinal models to the grey matter data collected at repeated occasions, seeking differences in patterns of volume change over time by sex and diagnostic group in a voxel-wise analysis. Additionally, using a region-of-interest approach, we fit longitudinal models to the global volumetric data of predetermined brain regions to determine whether this more conventional approach is sufficient for determining sex and group differences in atrophy. Our longitudinal analyses revealed that, of the various grey matter regions investigated, males and females in the AD group and the aMCI group showed different patterns of decline over time compared to controls in the bilateral precuneus, bilateral caudate nucleus, right entorhinal gyrus, bilateral thalamus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left insula, and right amygdala. As one of the first investigation to model more than two time points of structural MRI data over time, our findings add insight into how AD and aMCI males and females differ from controls and from each other over time. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79959580163	Evaluation method with measureable space-time dynamic properties for mobile Ad Hoc networks	Mobility model is a crucial feature to differentiate ad hoc networks from other networks. The evaluation of dynamic network properties caused by mobility model is the basic problem for research on protocol simulation and related technologies, such as topology control and network performance measurement, in ad hoc networks. In this paper, a model-based description of ad hoc networks is improved to avoid the drawbacks in describing the corresponding space-time dynamic properties. Then a universal evaluation method with measureable space-time dynamic properties is presented. The dynamic properties of several mobility models are studied by constructing the space distribution of the nodes and designing the models for analyzing the topological space-time dynamic properties. Furthermore, a novel mobility model based on circular curve movement is proposed to improve the flexibility and the capability to describe realistic scenarios with curve movement. Simulation with NS2 shows the presented method can effectively evaluate the characteristics of the existing mobility models. The numerical results also show that the proposed mobility model has good dynamic properties in comparison with the existing mobility models. ©2011 ISCAS.

Two scenarios were set in the simulations to understand the impact of the high strength exploitation in recent years on sediment transport in the coastal zone of Bohai Bay. The simulated results show that a) the sediment in western Bohai Bay mainly transports along the coastline in the near shore area; b) The sediment transport is significantly correlated with the distribution of the residual currents; and c) the changes in geomorphology and coastline caused by coastal zone development have impact on sediment transport in western Bohai Bay to a certain extent. However, the in situ investigation of radioactive isotope activities near Tianjin Port show a non-steady sedimentation feature, which is inconsistent with the results from the simulated results and could be a result of frequent human disturbance. © 2011 IEEE.

The MRI datasets obtained from Centenarian Study (CS) and the ADNI project are analyzed via the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) shape analysis pipeline. Our results indicate that if the elderly brains are used as comparison baseline, there is no significant difference between centenarian and elderly brains, while the differences between elderly and MCI/AD brains are significant; if the centenarian brains are used as comparison baseline, the differences between centenarian and MCI brains are moderate, but much more significant differences between AD and centenarian brains appear. Further comparisons of volume and shape analysis suggest that ventricle shape characteristics could potentially be a more sensitive biomarker of AD progression than the traditionally assumed ventricle volumes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80053530611	Robust deformable-surface-based skull-stripping for large-scale studies	Skull-stripping refers to the separation of brain tissue from non-brain tissue, such as the scalp, skull, and dura. In large-scale studies involving a significant number of subjects, a fully automatic method is highly desirable, since manual skull-stripping requires tremendous human effort and can be inconsistent even after sufficient training. We propose in this paper a robust and effective method that is capable of skull-stripping a large number of images accurately with minimal dependence on the parameter setting. The key of our method involves an initial skull-stripping by co-registration of an atlas, followed by a refinement phase with a surface deformation scheme that is guided by prior information obtained from a set of real brain images. Evaluation based on a total of 831 images, consisting of normal controls (NC) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD), from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database indicates that our method performs favorably at a consistent overall overlap rate of approximately 98% when compared with expert results.

80055029446	Automated DNA fiber tracking and measurement	The rapid assessment of how cells respond to pathologic, biological, environmental, and endogenous agents is critical for understanding how such responses may increase genomic instability, disease development and, ultimately, affect quality of life. Recently, we have applied the technique of DNA fiber analysis to increase our understanding of how DNA damaging agents influence DNA replication [1]. The major drawback to this technique, however, is the length of time needed to manually assess the replication dynamics, i.e., 40 hours per experimental condition. We introduce in this paper an automatic and effective image analysis framework for accurate quantification of various replication tracks for high throughput DNA analysis, called Computer Assisted Selection and Analysis (CASA). This algorithm is implemented in two major steps: random-walk-based DNA fiber tracking and pattern-recognition-based measurement of the replication tracks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can yield results which are highly consistent with manual analysis and needs only 160-fold less processing time, without manual involvement. © 2011 IEEE.

80053906917	The Effect of Guanxi on Audit Quality in China	Two types of guanxi have a close association with auditor independence in China: firm-level connections derived from state ownership and personal connections developed through management affiliations with external auditors. This article examines the effects of these two types of connection and their joint effect on audit quality. We find that state ownership and management affiliations with the external auditor both increase the probability of receiving a clean audit opinion in China. Furthermore, the probability increment brought by management affiliations for non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) is greater than that for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These results suggest that state ownership and management affiliations are two important types of connection that impair auditor independence, and that management affiliations are of greater importance to private-sector firms than to SOEs. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

80053999033	Directed graph based image registration	In this paper, a novel intermediate templates guided image registration algorithm is proposed to achieve accurate registration results with a more appropriate strategy for intermediate template selection. We first demonstrate that registration directions and paths play a key role in the intermediate template guided registration methods. In light of this, a directed graph is built based on the asymmetric distances defined on all ordered image-pairs in the dataset. The allocated directed path can be used to guide the pairwise registration by successively registering the underlying subject towards the template through all intermediate templates on the path. Moreover, for the groupwise registration, a minimum spanning arborescence (MSA) is built with both the template (the root) and the directed paths (from all images to the template) determined simultaneously. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that our method can achieve more accurate registration results than both the traditional pairwise registration and the undirected graph based registration methods. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

82755161873	Discriminant analysis of longitudinal cortical thickness changes in Alzheimer's disease using dynamic and network features	Neuroimage measures from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, such as cortical thickness, have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies show that, AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC) can be distinguished with relatively high accuracy using the baseline cortical thickness. With the increasing availability of large longitudinal datasets, it also becomes possible to study the longitudinal changes of cortical thickness and their correlation with the development of pathology in AD. In this study, the longitudinal cortical thickness changes of 152 subjects from 4 clinical groups (AD, NC, Progressive-MCI and Stable-MCI) selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are measured by our recently developed 4 D (spatial+temporal) thickness measuring algorithm. It is found that the 4 clinical groups demonstrate very similar spatial distribution of grey matter (GM) loss on cortex. To fully utilize the longitudinal information and better discriminate the subjects from 4 groups, especially between Stable-MCI and Progressive-MCI, 3 different categories of features are extracted for each subject, i.e., (1) static cortical thickness measures computed from the baseline and endline, (2) cortex thinning dynamics, such as the thinning speed (mm/year) and the thinning ratio (endline/baseline), and (3) network features computed from the brain network constructed based on the correlation between the longitudinal thickness changes of different regions of interest (ROIs). By combining the complementary information provided by features from the 3 categories, 2 classifiers are trained to diagnose AD and to predict the conversion to AD in MCI subjects, respectively. In the leave-one-out cross-validation, the proposed method can distinguish AD patients from NC at an accuracy of 96.1%, and can detect 81.7% (AUC = 0.875) of the MCI converters 6 months ahead of their conversions to AD. Also, by analyzing the brain network built via longitudinal cortical thickness changes, a significant decrease (p < 0.02) of the network clustering coefficient (associated with the development of AD pathology) is found in the Progressive-MCI group, which indicates the degenerated wiring efficiency of the brain network due to AD. More interestingly, the decreasing of network clustering coefficient of the olfactory cortex region was also found in the AD patients, which suggests olfactory dysfunction. Although the smell identification test is not performed in ADNI, this finding is consistent with other AD-related olfactory studies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84855313460	Femtoscopy of pp collisions at √s=0.9 and 7 TeV at the LHC with two-pion Bose-Einstein correlations	We report on the high statistics two-pion correlation functions from pp collisions at √s=0.9TeV and √s=7TeV, measured by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The correlation functions as well as the extracted source radii scale with event multiplicity and pair momentum. When analyzed in the same multiplicity and pair transverse momentum range, the correlation is similar at the two collision energies. A three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis shows an increase of the emission zone with increasing event multiplicity as well as decreasing homogeneity lengths with increasing transverse momentum. The latter trend gets more pronounced as multiplicity increases. This suggests the development of space-momentum correlations, at least for collisions producing a high multiplicity of particles. We consider these trends in the context of previous femtoscopic studies in high-energy hadron and heavy-ion collisions and discuss possible underlying physics mechanisms. Detailed analysis of the correlation reveals an exponential shape in the outward and longitudinal directions, while the sideward remains a Gaussian. This is interpreted as a result of a significant contribution of strongly decaying resonances to the emission region shape. Significant nonfemtoscopic correlations are observed, and are argued to be the consequence of "mini-jet"-like structures extending to low p

84856594318	Directed graph based image registration	In this paper, a novel image registration method is proposed to achieve accurate registration between images having large shape differences with the help of a set of appropriate intermediate templates. We first demonstrate that directionality is a key factor in both pairwise image registration and groupwise registration, which is defined in this paper to describe the influence of the registration direction and paths on the registration performance. In our solution, the intermediate template selection and intermediate template guided registration are two coherent steps with directionality being considered. To take advantage of the directionality, a directed graph is built based on the asymmetric distance defined on all ordered image pairs in the image population, which is fundamentally different from the undirected graph with symmetric distance metrics in all previous methods, and the shortest distance between template and subject on the directed graph is calculated. The allocated directed path can be thus utilized to better guide the registration by successively registering the subject through the intermediate templates one by one on the path towards the template. The proposed directed graph based solution can also be used in groupwise registration. Specifically, by building a minimum spanning arborescence (MSA) on the directed graph, the population center, i.e., a selected template, as well as the directed registration paths from all the rest of images to the population center, is determined simultaneously. The performance of directed graph based registration algorithm is demonstrated by the spatial normalization on both synthetic dataset and real brain MR images. It is shown that our method can achieve more accurate registration results than both the undirected graph based solution and the direct pairwise registration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It finds that fully privatized firms perform worse than state-controlled enterprises. Expropriation by private block shareholders is greater than that by state block shareholders. Furthermore, increase in expropriation is negatively related to performance change. The results suggest that full privatization may not yield the expected efficiency gains in transition economies with weak legal system.

84861956261	State ownership, tax status and size effect of effective tax rate in China	Political cost theory and political power theory are two views on the effect of firm size on effective tax rate (ETR) in extant literature. The size effect of ETR can be investigated further by focusing on the relationship between firms and the government. This paper uses state ownership and tax status to capture this relationship and examines how firm size, state ownership and tax status jointly affect effective tax rates. It is found that, when firms do not enjoy a preferential tax status, firm size is positively associated with effective tax rates for privately controlled firms and negatively associated for state-controlled firms. The results show that political cost theory explains the relationship between size and effective tax rate for privately controlled firms, whereas political power theory explains this relationship for state-controlled firms. For those firms that already enjoy a preferential tax status, there is no significant relationship between their size and their tax burdens. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The calculation results show that both the velocity and pressure in gas explosion process experience the stages of "rise-fall-second wave-fall-swing". In the initial stage of the flame propagation, the deflagration volume of gas increases rapidly, and the velocity, pressure and temperature of the flame also rise up quickly, and present laminar burning state during a certain time. Then, both the velocity and pressure have appeared swings in various degrees, which are the results of concurrent effects of pressure wave and reflected wave. Meanwhile, the velocity of the flame achieves the peak value ahead the pressure, this is mainly attributed to the superimposition of explosion pressure wave and reflected pressure wave, which leads to the rise of pressure, while the reflected pressure wave leads to the decrease of velocity. The best content of mine gas is that the velocity and pressure are in the minimum value, and the gas burning lasts the longest time, in this time the mine gas hasn't been completely accelerated, and haven't formed the detonation state.

84868237036	Groupwise segmentation improves neuroimaging classification accuracy	Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is critical for treatment of the disease. Many algorithms have been proposed to improve classification performance. While most existing methods focus on exploring different feature extraction and selection techniques, in this paper, we show that the pre-processing steps for MRI scans, i.e., registration and segmentation, significantly affect the classification performance. Specifically, we evaluate the classification performance given by a multi-atlas based multi-image segmentation (MABMIS) method, with respect to more conventional segmentation methods. By incorporating tree-based groupwise registration and iterative groupwise segmentation strategies, MABMIS attains more accurate and consistent segmentation results compared with the conventional methods that do not take into account the inherent distribution of images under segmentation. This increased segmentation accuracy will benefit classification by minimizing errors that are propagated to the subsequent analysis steps. Experimental results indicate that MABMIS achieves better performance when compared with the conventional methods in the following classification tasks using the ADNI dataset: AD vs. MCI (accuracy: 71.8%), AD vs. healthy control (HC) (89.1%), progressive MCI vs. HC (84.4%), and progressive MCI vs. stable MCI (70.0%). These results show that pre-processing the images accurately is critical for neuroimaging classification. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84868459029	Energy-aware and self-adaptive anomaly detection scheme based on network tomography in mobile ad hoc networks	Anomaly detection is indispensable for satisfying security services in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) applications. Often, however, a highly secure mechanism consumes a large amount of network resources, resulting in network performance degradation. To shift intrusion detection from existing security-centric design approaches to network performance centric design schemes, this paper presents a framework for designing an energy-aware and self-adaptive anomaly detection scheme for resource constrained MANETs. The scheme uses network tomography, a new technique for studying internal link performance based solely on end-to-end measurements. With the support of a module comprising a novel spatial-time model to identify the MANET topology, an energy-aware algorithm to sponsor system service, a method based on the expectation maximum to infer delay distribution, and a Self-organizing Map (SOM) neural network solution to profile link activity, the proposed system is capable of detecting link anomalies and localizing malicious nodes. Consequently, the proposed scheme offers a trade-off between overall network security and network performance, without causing any heavy network overload. Moreover, it provides an additional approach to monitor the spatial-time behavior of MANETs, including network topology, link performance and network security. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified through extensive experiments. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84875713203	aBEAT: A Toolbox for Consistent Analysis of Longitudinal Adult Brain MRI	Longitudinal brain image analysis is critical for revealing subtle but complex structural and functional changes of brain during aging or in neurodevelopmental disease. However, even with the rapid increase of clinical research and trials, a software toolbox dedicated for longitudinal image analysis is still lacking publicly. To cater for this increasing need, we have developed a dedicated 4D Adult Brain Extraction and Analysis Toolbox (aBEAT) to provide robust and accurate analysis of the longitudinal adult brain MR images. Specially, a group of image processing tools were integrated into aBEAT, including 4D brain extraction, 4D tissue segmentation, and 4D brain labeling. First, a 4D deformable-surface-based brain extraction algorithm, which can deform serial brain surfaces simultaneously under temporal smoothness constraint, was developed for consistent brain extraction. Second, a level-sets-based 4D tissue segmentation algorithm that incorporates local intensity distribution, spatial cortical-thickness constraint, and temporal cortical-thickness consistency was also included in aBEAT for consistent brain tissue segmentation. Third, a longitudinal groupwise image registration framework was further integrated into aBEAT for consistent ROI labeling by simultaneously warping a pre-labeled brain atlas to the longitudinal brain images. The performance of aBEAT has been extensively evaluated on a large number of longitudinal MR T1 images which include normal and dementia subjects, achieving very promising results. A Linux-based standalone package of aBEAT is now freely available at http://www.nitrc.org/projects/abeat. © 2013 Dai et al.

84875756746	Charged kaon femtoscopic correlations in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV	Correlations of two charged identical kaons (KchKch) are measured in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One-dimensional KchKch correlation functions are constructed in three multiplicity and four transverse momentum ranges. The KchKch femtoscopic source parameters R and λ are extracted. The KchKch correlations show a slight increase of femtoscopic radii with increasing multiplicity and a slight decrease of radii with increasing transverse momentum. These trends are similar to the ones observed for ππ and Ks0Ks0 correlations in pp and heavy-ion collisions. However at high multiplicities, there is an indication that the one-dimensional correlation radii for charged kaons are larger than those for pions in contrast to what was observed in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. © 2013 CERN.

84878293807	Firm performance, corporate ownership, and corporate social responsibility disclosure in China	The existing literature provides conflicting results on the association between firm performance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure. This paper empirically examines the effect of firm performance on CSR disclosure in terms of disclosure frequency and quality among Chinese listed firms and the possible mediating effect of corporate ownership on the relationship between firm performance and CSR disclosure. Our findings show that better-performing firms are more likely than worse-performing ones to disclose CSR information and to produce higher quality CSR reports. In addition, the link between firm performance and CSR disclosure is found to be weaker among state-owned enterprises compared with non-state-owned ones. © 2013 The Authors.

84878313253	Consistent 4D brain extraction of serial brain MR images	Accurate and consistent skull stripping of serial brain MR images is of great importance in longitudinal studies that aim to detect subtle brain morphological changes. To avoid inconsistency and the potential bias introduced by independently performing skull-stripping for each time-point image, we propose an effective method that is capable of skull-stripping serial brain MR images simultaneously. Specifically, all serial images of the same subject are first affine aligned in a groupwise manner to a common space to avoid any potential bias introduced by asymmetric transforms. A brain probability map, which encapsulates prior information gathered from a population of real brain MR images, is then warped to the aligned serial images for guiding skull-stripping via a deformable surface method. In particular, the same initial surface meshes representing the initial brain surfaces are first placed on all aligned serial images, and then all these surface meshes are simultaneously evolved to the respective target brain boundaries, driven by the intensity-based force, the force from the probability map, as well as the force from the spatial and temporal smoothness. Especially, imposing the temporal smoothness helps achieve longitudinally consistent results. Evaluations on 20 subjects, each with 4 time points, from the ADNI database indicate that our method gives more accurate and consistent result compared with 3D skull-stripping method. To better show the advantages of our 4D brain extraction method over the 3D method, we compute the Dice ratio in a ring area (±5mm) surrounding the ground-truth brain boundary, and our 4D method achieves around 3% improvement over the 3D method. In addition, our 4D method also gives smaller mean and maximal surfaceto- surface distance measurements, with reduced variances. © 2013 SPIE.

84878333782	Mapping longitudinal cerebral cortex development using diffusion tensor imaging	Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could provide convenient and crucial insights into the underlying age-related biological maturation of human brains, including myelination, axonal density changes, fiber tract reorganization, and synaptic pruning processes. Fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from DTI has been commonly used to characterize cellular morphological changes associated with the development of human brain, due to its sensitivity to microstructural changes. In this paper, we aim to discern the longitudinal neurodevelopmental patterns in typically maturing human brains using 200 healthy subjects from 5 to 22 years of age, based on the FA in cortical gray matter (GM). Specifically, FA image is first aligned with the corresponding T1 image, which has been parcellated into different cortical ROIs, and then the average FA in each ROI is computed. Linear mixed model is used to analyze the FA developmental pattern in each cortical ROI. The developmental trajectory of FA in each ROI across ages is delineated, and the best-fitting models of age-related changes in FA were linear for all ROIs. FA generally increases with the age from 5 to 22 years of age. In addition, males and females follow the similar pattern, with the FA of females being generally lower than that of males in most ROIs. This provides us some insights into the microstructural changes in the longitudinal cerebral cortex development. © 2013 SPIE.

84881620994	Kernel-based multi-task joint sparse classification for Alzheimer'S disease	Multi-modality imaging provides complementary information for diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this paper, we propose a kernel-based multi-task sparse representation model to combine the strengths of MRI and PET imaging features for improved classification of AD. Sparse representation based classification seeks to represent the testing data with a sparse linear combination of training data. Here, our approach allows information from different imaging modalities to be used for enforcing class level joint sparsity via multi-task learning. Thus the common most representative classes in the training samples for all modalities are jointly selected to reconstruct the testing sample. We further improve the discriminatory power by extending the framework to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) so that nonlinearity in the features can be captured for better classification. Experiments on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database shows that our proposed method can achieve 93.3% and 78.9% accuracy for classification of AD and MCI from healthy controls, respectively, demonstrating promising performance in AD study. © 2013 IEEE.

84885730468	Centrality determination of Pb-Pb collisions at √s	This publication describes the methods used to measure the centrality of inelastic Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair with ALICE. The centrality is a key parameter in the study of the properties of QCD matter at extreme temperature and energy density, because it is directly related to the initial overlap region of the colliding nuclei. Geometrical properties of the collision, such as the number of participating nucleons and the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, are deduced from a Glauber model with a sharp impact parameter selection and shown to be consistent with those extracted from the data. The centrality determination provides a tool to compare ALICE measurements with those of other experiments and with theoretical calculations. © 2013 CERN.

84904571237	Technical design report for the upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system	ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is studying the physics of strongly interacting matter, and in particular the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), using proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The ALICE Collaboration is preparing a major upgrade of the experimental apparatus, planned for installation in the second long LHC shutdown in the years 2018-2019. A key element of the ALICE upgrade is the construction of a new, ultra-light, high-resolution Inner Tracking System (ITS) based on monolithic CMOS pixel detectors. The primary focus of the ITS upgrade is on improving the performance for detection of heavy-flavour hadrons, and of thermal photons and low-mass di-electrons emitted by the QGP. With respect to the current detector, the new Inner Tracking System will significantly enhance the determination of the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, the tracking efficiency at low transverse momenta, and the read-out rate capabilities. This will be obtained by seven concentric detector layers based on a 50 μm thick CMOS pixel sensor with a pixel pitch of about 30×30 μm
