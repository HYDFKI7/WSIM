17244367170	Research on combustion characteristics of biomass and coals with different ranks	Combustion characteristics of three different ranks of coals (lignite, bituminous coal, and anthracite), two biomass materials (wheat straw and maize cob), and coal-biomass mixture were studied by using the TG/DTG/DTA technique. Combustion parameters such as ignition temperature, peak temperature of maximum weight loss rate, burnout temperature, maximum rate of combustion, and combustibility index were analyzed. The kinetic parameters were calculated based on experimental results and by using Freeman-Carroll (FC) method. The results show that the combustion characteristic temperature of the biomass sample is lower and the maximum rate of combustion is faster than that of coal. And the combustion characteristic temperature decreases while the maximum rate of combustion increases with the addition of biomass materials for lignite and bituminous coals. As for anthracite, the ignition temperature change a little and burnout temperature decreases when biomass materials is added.

The influences of temperature, catalysts and moisture on microcrystallite structure of pyrolysis gasification semicoke were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The result shows that there is the microcrystallite resembling crystallite in biomass and its char, and the diameter of microcrystallite increases with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature. The size of microcrystallite become smaller in different approaches while using different catalysts. The size of microcrystallite will decrease with the increasing of moisture.

33747068265	Mineral transformation of Huainan coal ashes in reducing atmospheres	By using the advanced instrumentation of a Computer Controlled Scanning Electron Microscope (CCSEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), the ash composition and the mineral components of six typical Huainan coals of different origins were studied. The transformation of mineral matter at high temperatures was tracked by XRD in reducing conditions. The quartz phase decreased sharply and the anorthite content tended to increase at first and then decreased with increasing temperatures. The formed mullite phase reached a maximum at 1250°C but showed a tendency of slow decline when the temperature was over 1250°C. The mullite formed in the heating process was the main reason of the high ash melting temperature of Huainan coals. Differences in peak intensity of mullite and anorthite reflected differences in phase concentration of the quenched slag fractions, which contributed to the differences in ash melting temperatures. The differences in the location of an amorphous hump maximum indicated differences of glass types which may affect ash melting temperatures. For Huainan coal samples with relatively high ash melting temperatures, the intensity of the diffraction lines for mullite under reducing condition is high while for the samples with relatively low ash melting temperature the intensity for anorthite is high.

33748964176	Study on the characteristics of mineral matter in Huainan coals by computer controlled scanning electron microscope (CCSEM)	The mineral features, ash composition, ash fusion temperature of Huainan coals were investigated by CCSEM, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and JIS (Japan Industrial Standard) ash cone melting method respectively. The mineral matter is characterized by higher aluminosilicate clay minerals contents (more than 60% of the total mineral matter in coal) with quartz, which accounts for the higher ash flow temperatures, frequently higher than 1 500°C. The contents of calcite and dolomite in Huainan coals range from 0.16% to about 11.57%. Another important non-silicate mineral matter, pyrite, ranges from 0.73% to 12.25%. Low amount of kaolinite-type clays and high amount of calcite and pyrite in the HN115 and XM coals are beneficial to ash melting. It is suggested that the high content of kaolinite in Huainan coals shows the high ash fusion temperature. CCSEM results also provide the size distribution of the minerals in Huainan coals. Generally, the mineral has bimodal size distribution in 6 Huainan coals.

33747285767	A comparative study of thermolysis characteristics and kinetics of seaweeds and fir wood	Thermal analysis and thermolysis kinetics of three kinds of seaweeds and fir wood (M. glyptostriboides Huet Cheng), a kind of typical land plant, had been conducted. The results showed that thermal stability follows the order of Grateloupia filicina < Ulva lactuca < Dictyopteris divaricata < fir wood. A notable difference on heat flow between seaweeds and fir wood during thermolysis was that the former were mainly connected with exothermic processes at relatively lower temperature regimes, while the latter was connected with an apparent endotherm at a relatively higher temperature regime followed by a maximum exothermic peak. This suggested that the heat coupling might be realized if co-thermolysis of seaweeds and fir wood were carried out. The main devolatilization phase of each seaweed could be described by Avrami-Erofeev equation, which indicated that thermolysis of seaweeds follows the mechanism of random nucleation and nuclei growth, whereas that of fir wood by Z-L-T equation and its thermolysis mechanism was three-dimensional diffusion. The activation energies calculated for both seaweeds and fir wood increase as conversion increases. However, those for the former have wider distribution. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33846022386	Application of the FactSage to Predict the Ash Melting Behavior in Reducing Conditions1 1 Supported by the Natural Science Foundation of the Education Ministry of Anhui Province (2004kj125) and the Key Project of Huainan (2003001).	FactSage has been used to predict the ash behavior and ash fusion temperature (AFT) at high temperature under reducing atmosphere conditions. For Huainan coal ash samples, it has demonstrated a good agreement between the liquid phase formation as the function of temperature and the tested AFT. The tested and predicted flow temperature (FT) for two typical Huainan coal ashes with the addition of CaO flux are quite fit with the maximum temperature difference less than 74°C which is within acceptable range. It can be concluded that FactSage in combination with X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to predict the reactions occurring between minerals, as well as the mineral transformation and slag formation. This is probably an improved way to interpret melting properties of mineral matter in coal and assist in quantifying slag formation in gasifier operation. © 2006 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

33947198121	Pyrolysis characteristics and kinetic modeling of three biomass species	Thermal analysis of pine wood, cotton' stalk and fir wood sawdust was carried out under various heating rates and dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. The correlation between pyrolysis temperature and ash in the biomass indicates that the inherent minerals in the biomass can catalyze the pyrolysis. Modeling of the pyrolysis of the three biomass species assuming hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin pyrolyzing independently and parallelly obeying first order reaction mechanism was accomplished employing the nonlinear least squares algorithm. The calculated kinetic parameters are in agreement with those reported. In addition, it was found that, as heating rate increases, activation energy values of cellulose and lignin increases and their contribution to weight loss tends to fall, whereas those of hemicellulose decreases and its contribution to weight loss tends to rise. The underlying cause of this changing trend was analyzed in terms of the properties of the main components of the lignocellulosic biomass.

37149050015	Grey-model forecast of coal desulphurization efficiency with microorganism leaching	Bioleaching is an important method of coal microorganism desulfurization. The coal-serial and non-coal-serial Thiobacillus ferrooxidans were utilized to bioleach the pyrite sulfur from coal. Based on the experimental result and grey system theory, a grey forecast model for microorganism leaching pyrite from coal was proposed. The forecast accuracy of GM(1, 1) is the highest through checkout. Compared with the actual coal leaching desulfurization rates, the calculated desulfurization rates using the grey model have some error for short-term forecast, but coincident for long-term forecast. The results show that the gray forecast method is a valid method to estimate coal microorganism desulfurization efficiency and GM(1, 1) may be used to predict coal bio-leaching desulfurization efficiency for a long period.

The mechanical performance and durability were investigated. Then the phase compositions, microstructure and morphologies of as-received cement-based composite were studied by X-ray Diffractometer, TGA-DTA and SEM.

The powder sample was mixed with silicon carbide which acted as microwave absorber in a quartz reactor and the reactor was then put into a 2450MHz microwave oven for pyrolyzing at ca. 470°C for 12min. The mass ratio of silicon carbide to sample was 5:3. In contrast, the same samples were pyrolyzed in a Curie-point pyrolyser coupled to GC-MS. Analysis of both volatile products indicates that microwave pyrolysis led to a novel distribution of the organic products in the condensed volatiles. Specifically, more light components appeared in the volatile from microwave pyrolysis, in which acetol was a dominant component. Sodium carbonate made acetol more abundant with a concentration up to 50% in terms of integration of the 25 main organic compounds in the condensed volatile. In contrast, the instant analysis of volatile from the Curie-point pyrolyser proved to be a composition of wider distribution and none was extraordinary abundant. Moreover, sodium carbonate inhibited the acetol formation in this case. A potential application of acetol was proposed and the critical problems related to realizing this application were discussed.

Copper accumulation rates of FS10-C under 100, 200 and 400 mg/L Cu(II) concentrations were 50.6%, 30.3% and 4.7%, respectively. The SEM showed no morphological variation in FS10-C at 100 mg/L Cu(II) and mostly complete cell structure at 400 mg/L Cu(II). EDX results showed that weight percentages of copper in FS10-C were 18.50% and 30.40% at 100 and 400 mg/L Cu(II), respectively, and biosorption ability of mycelium was higher than that of spore.

By grinding and screening, the fineness of the clam-shell powder was controlled at about 124 μm. Effects of clam-shell powders un-sintered and sintered at different temperatures on performance of the cement mortar were compared. The proper sintering temperature and addition amount of clam-shell powder were determined. Hydration mechanism of the modified mortar was further studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetry -differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). The results show that finely ground clam-shell powder sintered at 850-900°C with addition amount of 3% improved performance of fly ash cement-based material significantly.

84877942116	An investigation of coal biodegradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium	A mutant of Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P. chrysosporium), which is capable of degrading lignin, was bred by ultraviolet ray irradiation and this mutant strain shows high capability of degrading of lignite. The degradation ratio of original Yima lignite and nitric acid treated Yima lignite by this mutant are 37.6% and 51.62% respectively, whereas those by the original strain are 31.84% and 32.55% respectively. The degradation products were characterized by X-ray diffractograms analysis (XRD), Fourier transmission infrared (FTIR) and the thermogravimetric analysis (TG). The results show that the polymerization degree of the aromatic nucleus and the molecular weights of products are decreased obviously, and the contents of the functional groups are remarkable changed compared with the original lignite.

84879518636	Hydrophobic agglomeration of colloidal kaolinite in aqueous suspensions with dodecylamine	The stability of colloidal kaolinite dispersions in the presence of dodecylamine (DDA) has been studied in this work through the measurements of aggregation degree, zeta potential and adsorption. The experimental results show that DDA can induce a strong aggregation of colloidal kaolinite in aqueous suspensions even though the particles are highly negatively charged. This aggregation closely correlated to the adsorption of DDA cation on kaolinite surfaces and the hydrophobicity, so that it should belong to hydrophobic agglomeration. The adsorption isotherm of DDA on kaolinite surfaces showed two regions in which the adsorption density sharply increased, which might correspond to the hemi-micelle and bilayer adsorption of DDA cation on the surfaces. In addition, the hydrophobic agglomeration could be weakened by the addition of NaCl, which was due to the decrease of DDA adsorption on kaolinite surfaces. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84880650452	Effect of zinc-aluminum layered double hydroxides on thermal and flame retardant properties of intumescent flame retardant polypropylene composites	Sodium lauryl sulfate modified zinc-aluminum layered double hydroxides (ZnAl (SDS)- LDH) were prepared via the one-step method. The effects of ZnAl (SDS)-LDH on the flame retardant property and thermal stability property of the intumescent flame retardant polypropylene (PP) composites were investigated. And the effects of preparation method on the structure and flame retardant properties of the intumescent flame retardant PP composites were studied as well. The preparation method greatly influences the structure, and only by reasonable preparation method can the intumescent flame retardant PP/ZnAl (SDS)-LDH nanocomposites be prepared. The synergistic effects of ZnAKSDS)-LDH with intumescent flame retardants (IFRs) can be influenced by the content of ZnAKSDS)-LDH and the preparation method. When ZnAKSDS)-LDH is added before IFRs, the LOI value is evidently higher than those from adding ZnAKSDS)-LDH after IFRs.

84890559148	Study of enhanced low-quality coal oxidative desulphurization and deashing by using HNO3 and microwave pretreatment	In this paper, the effect of urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) solution on desulphurization and demineralization of coal with high sulphur and high ash by using HNO3 and microwave pretreatment was investigated. The oxidation process is strongly dependent on irradiation power and time for microwave pretreatment, UHP concentration, leaching time and temperature of the UHP solution. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared technique have been performed for the raw and treated coals. Compared with the UHP alone, successive treatments with HNO3 and microwave pretreatment resulted in the significant removal of total sulphur and mineral matter from the coal. The proposed experimental method has the meaning of practical guide to the desulphurization and deashing of coal by microwave. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

84904891638	Effect of breakage and cleavage ways on the electrokinetic properties of kaolinite particles	In order to study the electrokinetic properties of different sizes kaolinite particles, the zeta potentials in aqueous solutions were determined by the ZetaProbe analyzer. The effects of breakage and cleavage ways on the electrokinetic properties of kaolinite particles were analyzed according to the changes of each surface area caused by different cleavage ways. The results show that the IEP of 0.30, 4.65 and 7.95 mm kaolinite particles decreased first and then increased with the increasing of size from 0.30 mm to 7.95 mm. The negative zeta potential increased when 3.00<pH<7.40, and decreased first and then increased when pH≥7.40. The T-O cleavage and E-E cleavage will decrease and increase a value (acid-base response coefficient) of kaolinite particles, respectively. The T-O cleavage plays a dominant role in the breakage and cleavage of large kaolinite particles, and the E-E cleavage plays a more and more dominant role in the breakage and cleavage of smaller kaolinite particles, which is the main cause of electrokinetic characteristics of different sizes kaolinite particles in aqueous solutions.
