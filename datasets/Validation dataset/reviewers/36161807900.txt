84930476229	Genome-wide analysis of immunophilin FKBP genes and expression patterns in Zea mays	The receptors for the immunosuppression drugs FK506 and rapamycin are called FKBPs (FK506-binding proteins). FKBPs comprise a large family; they are found in many species, including bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. As a class of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase enzymes, the FKBP genes have been the focus of recent studies on plant stress tolerance and immunology. We identified and analyzed gene families encoding these proteins in maize using computational and molecular biology approaches. Thirty genes were found to encode putative FKBPs according to their FK506-binding domain. The FKBP genes can be classified into single domain and multiple domain members based on the number of the domains. By analysis of the physical locations, the 30 FKBP genes were found to be widely distributed on 10 chromosomes. After analysis of the FKBP phylogenetic tree in the maize genome, we found that the 30 genes revealed two major clades. Gene duplication played a major role in the evolution of FKBP genes, which suggests that the FKBP genes in maize have a pattern significantly different from that of these genes in rice. Based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we found that the 30 FKBPs were expressed differently in various tissues in maize, which suggests that FKBP genes play different roles in each tissue. Several FKBPs were expressed at higher levels in roots, indicating that these genes in maize may have similar or overlapping functions. © FUNPEC-RP.

33846134349	Cloning and sequence analysis of maize FAD2 gene	Delta-12 desaturases are involved in the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid in plant. Based on the conserved oligo amino acid residues of the published delta-12 desaturase genes from other higher plant species, a cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) from the total RNA of immature maize embryos. According to bioinformation analysis of the cDNA sequence, a specific fragment of FAD2 gene was isolated by RT-PCR from immature maize embryos, and DNA of the same length was amplified from maize genome. Results of sequence analysis indicate that they are all 1 164 bp long, and have just an open reading frame (ORF) coding for 387 amino acids, and there is no intron in the FAD2 ORF (GenBank accession DQ496227). The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned FAD2 showed high identity to those of other plant delta-12 fatty acid desaturases. It contains three histidine motifs and two long stretches of hydrophobic residues, indicative of an integral membrane protein spanning membrane four times. Analysis by semi-quantitive RT-PCR showed that FAD2 was strongly expressed in maize immature embryos than in leaves, stems and roots.

77954359784	A genomic analysis of disease-resistance genes encoding nucleotide binding sites in Sorghum bicolor	A large set of candidate nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-encoding genes related to disease resistance was identified in the sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genome. These resistance (R) genes were characterized based on their structural diversity, physical chromosomal location and phylogenetic relationships. Based on their N-terminal motifs and leucine-rich repeats (LRR), 50 non-regular NBS genes and 224 regular NBS genes were identified in 274 candidate NBS genes. The regular NBS genes were classified into ten types: CNL, CN, CNLX, CNX, CNXL, CXN, NX, N, NL and NLX. The vast majority (97%) of NBS genes occurred in gene clusters, indicating extensive gene duplication in the evolution of S. bicolor NBS genes. Analysis of the S. bicolor NBS phylogenetic tree revealed two major clades. Most NBS genes were located at the distal tip of the long arms of the ten sorghum chromosomes, a pattern significantly different from rice and Arabidopsis, the NBS genes of which have a random chromosomal distribution. © 2010, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

84887613543	7-ketocholesterol-induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	The cytotoxicity of cholesterol oxidation products has been documented in several mammalian cell lines. It can lead to a wide range of diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this toxicity in vivo are scarce. The objective of the present study was to assess the potential toxic effects of 7-ketocholesterol, an important cholesterol oxidation product, on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data show for the first time that 7-ketocholesterol can induce dose-dependent cell death in S. cerevisiae. These results suggest that the death induced by this compound is apoptotic and accompanied by chromatin condensation, the production of ROS, and translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. We further showed that 7-ketocholesterol-induced cell death was partially rescued after pretreatment with caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk). In addition, caspase deletion resulted in promotion of cell viability. All these results strongly indicated that 7-ketocholesterol induces apoptosis in yeast cells through a caspase-dependent pathway. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

77949545890	The granule morphology and structure of high-amylose maize starch	High-amylose maize starch with amylose content 53% was investigated at the starch granule morphology and structure. The results show that the granules have Maltese cross. The granules are polymorphic, but tend to have a relatively round and smooth appearance. Most granules shapes are undefined oval, a few of granules shapes are specific such as elongated rod-like, while some granules exhibit their shapes irregularly. There exit several papillary protrusions on the most granules surface, some holes on a few of granules and some fractures too. Each individual granule is solid. The granules are with a narrow size ranging from 3.5 μm to 30 μm in diameter, average size 10.2 μm. High-amylose starch displays B-type pattern, its crystallinity is 21%. The granule morphology and structure of high-amylose maize starch are different from those of normal maize starch.

77954453793	Molecular marker-assisted selection of the ae alleles in maize	The ae (amylose extender) recessive mutant alleles in maize are an important genetic resource for the development of high- amylose cultivars. On the basis of ae allele sequences (from the National Center for Biotechnology Information), the ae mutant alleles were cloned from high-amylose maize and the allelic Ae gene from common maize luyuan92 inbred lines. Five pairs of primers were designed to screen for a molecular marker of ae alleles, yielding a dominant molecular marker, ae474. We used 53 types of high-amylose maize and common maize inbred lines and their hybrid and backcross offspring for verification and analysis. The ae dominant molecular marker was effective in selecting for the ae alleles and for biological materials with a high-amylose genotype. Presence and absence of the marker in the offspring conformed to the expected Mendelian ratios. Using this marker, we were able to detect the ae alleles in a backcross and its second generation more efficiently (53.3 and 73.3%, respectively) than was possible without marker selection. These data indicate that the marker can be used as a tool to improve selection efficiency and accelerate the cultivation of new varieties of high-amylose maize. © FUNPEC-RP.

77958478956	Bacterially expressed dsRNA protects maize against SCMV infection	RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific, posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) process in plants that is mediated by dsRNA homologous to the silenced gene(s). In this study, we report an efficient method to produce dsRNA using a bacterial expression system. Two fragments of the Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV) CP (coat protein) gene were amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into the inverted-repeat cloning vector pUCCRNAi. The two recombinant plasmids were transformed individually into E. coli HT115, an RNase-III deficient strain, and dsRNA was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The crude extracts of E. coli HT115 containing large amounts of dsRNA were applied to plants as a spray and the experiment confirmed a preventative efficacy. Our findings demonstrated that spraying crude dsRNA-containing extracts inhibited SCMV infection, and the dsRNA derived from an upstream region (CP1) was more effective than was dsRNA derived from a downstream region (CP2) of the SCMV CP gene. The results provide a valuable tool for plant viral control using dsRNA and the PTGS approach. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78349312522	Reactivation of a silenced minimal Mutator transposable element system following low-energy nitrogen ion implantation in maize	In maize, Mutator transposable elements are either active or silenced within the genome. In response to environmental stress, silenced Mutator elements could be reactivated, leading to changes in genome structure and gene function. However, there is no direct experimental evidence linking environmental stress and Mutator transposon reactivation. Using a maize line that contains a single inactive MuDR and a lone nonautonomous Mutator element, a Mu1 insertion in the recessive reporter allele a1-mum2 in an inactive Mutator background, we directly assessed Mutator reactivation following low-energy nitrogen ion implantation.

79251548912	Genome-wide identification, classification and analysis of heat shock transcription factor family in maize	Background: Heat shock response in eukaryotes is transcriptionally regulated by conserved heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs). Hsf genes are represented by a large multigene family in plants and investigation of the Hsf gene family will serve to elucidate the mechanisms by which plants respond to stress. In recent years, reports of genome-wide structural and evolutionary analysis of the entire Hsf gene family have been generated in two model plant systems, Arabidopsis and rice. Maize, an important cereal crop, has represented a model plant for genetics and evolutionary research. Although some Hsf genes have been characterized in maize, analysis of the entire Hsf gene family were not completed following Maize (B73) Genome Sequencing Project.Results: A genome-wide analysis was carried out in the present study to identify all Hsfs maize genes. Due to the availability of complete maize genome sequences, 25 nonredundant Hsf genes, named ZmHsfs were identified. Chromosomal location, protein domain and motif organization of ZmHsfs were analyzed in maize genome. The phylogenetic relationships, gene duplications and expression profiles of ZmHsf genes were also presented in this study. Twenty-five ZmHsfs were classified into three major classes (class A, B, and C) according to their structural characteristics and phylogenetic comparisons, and class A was further subdivided into 10 subclasses. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the orthologs from the three species (maize, Arabidopsis and rice) were distributed in all three classes, it also revealed diverse Hsf gene family expression patterns in classes and subclasses. Chromosomal/segmental duplications played a key role in Hsf gene family expansion in maize by investigation of gene duplication events. Furthermore, the transcripts of 25 ZmHsf genes were detected in the leaves by heat shock using quantitative real-time PCR. The result demonstrated that ZmHsf genes exhibit different expression levels in heat stress treatment.Conclusions: Overall, data obtained from our investigation contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of the maize Hsf gene family and provides the first step towards directing future experimentation designed to perform systematic analysis of the functions of the Hsf gene family. © 2011 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79952745764	Genome-wide analysis of the auxin response factor (ARF) gene family in maize (Zea mays)	Auxin response factors (ARFs) are an important family involved in auxin-mediated response through specific binding to auxin response elements (AuxREs). A few members of the ARF family have been functionally characterized in Arabidopsis, rice (Oryza sativa), Poplar (Populous trichocarpa). However, little is known about ARF genes in maize (Zea mays). We performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the maize ARF gene family including analysis of the genome sequence, conserved domains, chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships, gene duplication, and expression profiles. 35 ZmARF genes were identified and categorized into four groups (Class I, II, III, and IV). In addition, a segmental ZmARF duplication event was shown to play an important role in maize ARF gene expansion. 7 ZmARF genes had no expression in specific tissues we obtained, but presented in mixed tissues according to the NCBI EST database, respectively. These studies have laid the theoretical foundation for further functional verification of these ZmARF genes. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

However, little is known about the MADS-box genes in maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Here, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the MADS-box gene family in the maize and sorghum genomes and identified 75 maize and 65 sorghum MADS-box genes. We subsequently carried out a comparative analysis of these genes, including the gene structure, phylogenetic relationship, conserved protein motifs, gene duplications, chromosomal locations and expression pattern between the two plants. According to these analyses, the MADS-box genes in both maize and sorghum were categorized into five (MIKC

79958753423	Identification and characterization of Dicer-like, Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene families in maize	Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at least by two processes, RNA interference at the post-transcriptional level and chromatin modification at the transcriptional level. Distinct small RNAs (approximately 21-24 nucleotides; sRNAs) were demonstrated to play vital roles in facilitating gene silencing. In plants, the generation of these sRNAs mainly depends on some proteins encoded by respective Dicer-like (DCL), Argonaute (AGO) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) gene families. Here, we analyzed the DCL, AGO and RDR gene families in maize, including gene structure, phylogenetic relationships, protein conserved motifs and genomic localization among gene family members. A total of 5 Zmdcl, 18 Zmago and 5 Zmrdr genes were identified in maize. Phylogenetic analyses clustered each of these genes families into four subfamilies. In addition, gene chromosomal localization revealed that five pairs of Zmago genes resulted from tandem or segmental duplication, respectively. EST expression data mining revealed that these newly identified genes had temporal and spatial expression pattern. Furthermore, the transcripts of these genes were detected in the leaves by two different abiotic stress treatments using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The data demonstrated that these genes exhibited different expression levels in stress treatments. The results of this study provided basic genomic information for these gene families and insights into the probable roles of these genes in plant growth and development. This will further provide a solid foundation for future functional genomics studies of Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR gene families in maize. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80052791049	Genome-wide identification and characterization of the cyclin gene family in Populus trichocarpa	The cell cycle is controlled by the interplay of many different molecules. Foremost in this process are the cyclin family of proteins that serve to regulate the cell cycle by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). To date, the cell cycle and functions of the cyclin gene family have been extensively analyzed in Arabidopsis, rice, and humans. However, the cyclin gene family in poplar has rarely been researched. In the present study, cyclin genes were predicted in the poplar draft genome sequence by comparison with Arabidopsis cyclin genes, and analyzed by phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal distributions, protein motifs, and expression patterns. A conserved cyclin_N domain distinguished poplar, and 45 predicted cyclin genes were classified into seven types, including A-, B-, C-, D-, Q-, T-, and Z-types. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that five of the seven cyclin types were consistent with Arabidopsis types, the poplar cyclin D gene subfamily exhibited more classes than observed in Arabidopsis and rice, and Q- and Z-types each possessed only one cyclin gene, which we defined as new putative types of poplar cyclin genes. We selected the special cyclin genes (Q- and Z-types and D3 subgroups) to study the expression patterns in different tissues by semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The outcomes indicated that almost all of the D3 subgroup genes were expressed in various tissues, the Q cyclin gene was detected in roots and stems, and the Z cyclin gene was only identified in roots. Analysis of the poplar cyclin gene family provides insights into cell cycle mechanisms and cyclin gene functions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

80052451793	Genome-wide analysis of BURP domain-containing genes in Maize and Sorghum	BURP domain-containing genes comprise a large plant-specific family, yet the functions are very poorly understood, especially in maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare). In this study, 26 BURP family genes in maize (ZmBURP01-15) and sorghum (SbBURP01-11) were identified including the gene structure, phylogenetic relationship, conserved protein motifs and chromosome locations. These genes have diverse exon-intron structures and distinct organization of putative motifs. The distributions of the genes vary: 15 ZmBURP genes are located in maize on five chromosomes, and 11 SbBURP genes in sorghum are on six chromosomes. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of BURP protein sequences from maize, sorghum and other plants, the BURP genes in maize and sorghum were categorized into five subfamilies (RD22-like, PG1β-like, BURP VI, BURP VII and BURP VIII). Transcript level analysis of ZmBURP genes revealed the expression patterns of BURP genes in maize under diffferent stress conditions. The results suggested that only eight ZmBURP genes were responsive to at least one of the stress treatments applied. Among these genes, seven genes (ZmBURP04, ZmBURP05, ZmBURP08, ZmBURP09, ZmBURP12, ZmBURP14, ZmBURP15) were responsive to ABA and cold respectively, two genes (ZmBURP06 and ZmBURP14) were responsive to NaCl. The results presented here provide useful information for further functional analysis of the BURP gene family in maize and sorghum. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

82555185581	Systematic analysis of sequences and expression patterns of drought-responsive members of the HD-Zip gene family in maize	Background: Members of the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family encode transcription factors that are unique to plants and have diverse functions in plant growth and development such as various stress responses, organ formation and vascular development. Although systematic characterization of this family has been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice, little is known about HD-Zip genes in maize (Zea mays L.). Methods and Findings: In this study, we described the identification and structural characterization of HD-Zip genes in the maize genome. A complete set of 55 HD-Zip genes (Zmhdz1-55) were identified in the maize genome using Blast search tools and categorized into four classes (HD-Zip I-IV) based on phylogeny. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are distributed unevenly across all 10 chromosomes. Segmental duplication contributed largely to the expansion of the maize HD-ZIP gene family, while tandem duplication was only responsible for the amplification of the HD-Zip II genes. Furthermore, most of the maize HD-Zip I genes were found to contain an overabundance of stress-related cis-elements in their promoter sequences. The expression levels of the 17 HD-Zip I genes under drought stress were also investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). All of the 17 maize HD-ZIP I genes were found to be regulated by drought stress, and the duplicated genes within a sister pair exhibited the similar expression patterns, suggesting their conserved functions during the process of evolution. Conclusions: Our results reveal a comprehensive overview of the maize HD-Zip gene family and provide the first step towards the selection of Zmhdz genes for cloning and functional research to uncover their roles in maize growth and development. © 2011 Zhao et al.

84859265803	Polyamines stimulate hyphal branching and infection in the early stage of Glomus etunicatum colonization	Polyamines are known to strongly stimulate hyphal growth in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The effect of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine on spore germination, hyphal elongation and branching by the AM fungus Glomus etunicatum was investigated in this study. The effect of spermine on infection and the development of the host and of daughter spores was further investigated using the dual monoaxenic culture system comprised of Gl. etunicatum fungal cultures in Ri T-DNA transformed carrot hairy roots. Spermidine and spermine showed positive effects on germination and all three polyamines significantly promoted hyphal growth. Hyphal branching was also strongly stimulated by treatment with polyamines, such as an increase in the number of branches. Infection during the early stages of the in vitro co-culture life cycle was enhanced in the presence of spermine, and daughter spores appeared at earlier timepoints compared to the control. Our results demonstrate that polyamines stimulate germination and hyphal branching in the early stage of AM fungal colonization. Moreover, results from the investigations conducted in the fungus-root co-culture suggest that polyamines may be involved in establishing the symbiotic relationship between root and fungus. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84859914061	In vivo and in vitro characterization of TEV protease mutants	Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) is frequently applied in the cleavage of fusion protein. However, production of TEV protease in Escherichia coli is hampered by low yield and poor solubility, and auto-cleavage of wild type TEVp gives rise to the loss-of-function. Previously it was reported that TEVp S219V displayed more stability, and TEVp variant containing T17S/N68D/I77V and double mutant L56V/S135G resulted in the enhanced production and solubility, respectively. Here, we introduced T17S/N68D/I77V in TEVp S219V to generate TEVpM1 and combined five amino acid mutations (T17S/L56V/N68D/I77V/S135G) in TEVp S219V to create TEVpM2. Among TEVp S219V, and two constructed variants, TEVpM2 displayed highest solubility and catalytic activity in vivo, using EmGFP as the solubility reporter, and the designed fusion protein as in vivo substrate containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tagged GST, a peptide sequence for thrombin and TEV cut and E. coli diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase. The purified TEVp mutants fused with double hexahistidine-tag at N and C terminus showed highest yield, solubility and cleavage efficiency. Mutations of five amino acid residues in TEVpM2 slightly altered protein secondary structure conformed by circular dichroism assay. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, genome-wide analysis of FKBP genes in Populus trichocarpa was performed. A total of 31 genes were identified to encode FK506-binding proteins in P. trichocarpa. These genes were distributed on 11 chromosomes. The subcelluar locations and evolutionary relationships of FKBPs in P. trichocarpa and other plants were analyzed, and the functions of the FKBPs isoforms were determined bioinformatically. A phylogenetic tree was generated from alignments of PtFKBP protein sequences, while phylogenetic relationships were also examined between PtFKBPs and FKBP in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Duplication played a significant role in poplar FKBP gene family evolution and expansion. The expression patterns of chloroplastic FKBP genes in response to different periods of illumination were measured, indicating that many FKBP genes are regulated by light. Meanwhile, several PtFKBPs were differentially regulated at the transcriptional level under cold and heat stress. This study provides new information that should permit further studies to characterize the functions of FKBPs in P. trichocarpa and other plants. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84863654008	CCCH-type zinc finger family in maize: Genome-wide identification, classification and expression profiling under abscisic acid and drought treatments	Background: CCCH-type zinc finger proteins comprise a large protein family. Increasing evidence suggests that members of this family are RNA-binding proteins with regulatory functions in mRNA processing. Compared with those in animals, functions of CCCH-type zinc finger proteins involved in plant growth and development are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we performed a genome-wide survey of CCCH-type zinc finger genes in maize (Zea mays L.) by describing the gene structure, phylogenetic relationships and chromosomal location of each family member. Promoter sequences and expression profiles of putative stress-responsive members were also investigated. A total of 68 CCCH genes (ZmC3H1-68) were identified in maize and divided into seven groups by phylogenetic analysis. These 68 genes were found to be unevenly distributed on 10 chromosomes with 15 segmental duplication events, suggesting that segmental duplication played a major role in expansion of the maize CCCH family. The Ka/Ks ratios suggested that the duplicated genes of the CCCH family mainly experienced purifying selection with limited functional divergence after duplication events. Twelve maize CCCH genes grouped with other known stress-responsive genes from Arabidopsis were found to contain putative stress-responsive cis-elements in their promoter regions. Seven of these genes chosen for further quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed differential expression patterns among five representative maize tissues and over time in response to abscisic acid and drought treatments. Conclusions: The results presented in this study provide basic information on maize CCCH proteins and form the foundation for future functional studies of these proteins, especially for those members of which may play important roles in response to abiotic stresses. © 2012 Peng et al.

84870811368	Molecular Cloning and Characterization of Orthologues of NPR1 Gene from Poplar	The non-expresser of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (NPR1) is a significant regulator of systemic acquired resistance in plants. In this study, two homologous poplar genes, PtNPR1.1 (accession number JQ231218), PtNPR1.2 (accession number JF732893), were identified by bioinformatic analysis and cloned from Populus deltoids cv. Nanlin 95. A phylogenetic tree was generated from alignments of PtNPR1 protein sequences and NPR1-like genes in other plants. Multiple protein alignments were also constructed to analyse the distribution of crucial domains and highly conserved functional amino acids. Cis-element analysis revealed that the PtNPR1 promoters contain RAV1AAT and W-boxes motifs, both of which are known to be functional cis-elements of the RAV1 and WRKY proteins, respectively. The PtNPR1.1-GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) fusion protein was expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, where it localized to the cytoplasm. Analysis of transcription levels by RT-PCR revealed expression patterns of PtNPR1.1 and PtNPR1.2 in different tissues and following SA and MeJA treatment in different time courses. The results indicated that PtNPR1.1 and PtNPR1.2 represent promising candidates for engineering resistance to broad-spectrum pathogens in poplar. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

84873171596	Novel synthesis strategy for the preparation of individual phytosterol oxides	Sterols (cholesterol and phytosterols) are important structural components of cell membranes and major constituents of lipid metabolism. Research on their oxides, such as the factors affecting oxidation, oxides' structures, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, aroused more attention in this decade. However, the biological roles of individual phytosterol oxides are still unclear because no commercial individual phytosterol oxide standards are available. Different from the traditional chemical synthesis, in the present study, chemical synthesis from a starting phytosterol mixture followed with a semipreparative HPLC separation produced individual oxides. TLC and analytical HPLC were used here to not only monitor the reaction process but also specifically analyze the synthetic intermediates and oxides. The chromatographic results exhibited strict rules and similar characteristics. Finally, for the first time, four individual phytosterol oxides were successfully separated and collected by a semipreparative HPLC system, thus providing a novel strategy for the preparation of individual phytosterol oxides. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84876932503	Mutant p53-R273H gains new function in sustained activation of EGFR signaling via suppressing miR-27a expression	p53 is a major tumor suppressor whose function is pivotal for protection against cancer. In over half of human cancers, p53 is inactivated due to either point mutation or loss of p53 gene. It has been well established that in addition to abrogating the tumorsuppressive function of wild-type p53, mutant p53 gains new functions and actively contributes to various stages of tumor progression. However, little is known about whether microRNA (miRNA) is involved in the gain-of-function of mutant p53. Here we report miR-27a as a novel downstream transcriptional target of mutant p53-273H. Mutant p53 binds to the miR-27a promoter region and suppresses its expression. We also identify epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a direct target of miR-27a. Via the miR-27a/EGFR axis, mutant p53-273H promotes a sustained EGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation, thereby facilitating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Collectively, this work reveals a direct link between the gainof-function of mutant p53 and miRNA and uncovers a novel mutant p53-273H/miR-27a/EGFR pathway that has an important role in promoting tumor development. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84879290681	A genome-wide analysis of the ERF gene family in sorghum	The ethylene response factor (ERF) family are members of the APETALA2 (AP2)/ERF transcription factor superfamily; they are known to play an important role in plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. ERF genes have been studied in Arabidopsis, rice, grape, and maize; however, there are few reports of ERF genes in sorghum. We identified 105 sorghum ERF (SbERF) genes, which were categorized into 12 groups (A-1 to A-6 and B-1 to B-6) based on their sequence similarity, and this new method of classification for ERF genes was then further characterized. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of SbERF genes was performed using a sorghum genomic database, to analyze the phylogeny of SbERF genes, identify other conserved motifs apart from the AP2/ERF domain, map SbERF genes to the 10 sorghum chromosomes, and determine the tissue-specific expression patterns of SbERF genes. Gene clustering indicates that SbERF genes were generated by tandem duplications. Comparison of SbERF genes with maize ERF homologs suggests lateral gene transfer between monocot species. These results can contribute to our understanting of the evolution of the ERF gene family. © FUNPEC-RP.

84881295351	RNA interference-mediated silencing of the starch branching enzyme gene improves amylose content in rice	Amylose and amylopectin are the 2 major components of plant storage starch. The rice starch branching enzyme (RBE) plays an important role in the starch components of rice. In the present study, we selected a specific 195-bp segment from the RBE3 gene to construct hairpin DNA, which was driven by an endosperm-specific high molecular weight glutenin promoter to regulate the biosynthesis of starch. An RNA interference plasmid for the RBE3 gene was constructed to form double-stranded RNA. Following Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation (in the cultivar Zhonghua 11), 41 transgenic plants were identified using PCR and Southern blot analysis. Semi-quantitative real-time PCR revealed that RBE3 gene expression was significantly reduced in immature transgenic seeds. Transgenic rice amylose content had an average increase of 140%. The highest rice amylose content was 47.61% and the growth rate increased 238% compared to the non-transgenic controls. Branching enzyme II activity was notably reduced, and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, soluble starch synthase, isoamylase, and pullulanase enzyme activity was markedly reduced in T

84882844343	Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of ankyrin-repeat gene family in maize	Members of the ankyrin repeats (ANK) gene family encode ANK domain that are common in diverse organisms and play important roles in cell growth and development, such as cell-cell signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. Recently, genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of the ANK gene family have been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice. However, little is known regarding the ANK genes in the entire maize genome. In this study, we described the identification and structural characterization of 71 ANK genes in maize (ZmANK). Then, comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of ZmANK genes family were performed including phylogenetic, domain and motif analysis, chromosomal localization, intron/exon structural patterns, gene duplications and expression profiling. Domain composition analyses showed that ZmANK genes formed ten subfamilies. Five tandem duplications and 14 segmental duplications were identified in ZmANK genes. Furthermore, we took comparative analysis of the total ANK gene family in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, ZmANKs were more closely paired with OsANKs than with AtANKs. At last, expression profile analyses were performed. Forty-one members of ZmANK genes held EST sequences records. Semi-quantitative expression and microarray data analysis of these 41 ZmANK genes demonstrated that ZmANK genes exhibit a various expression pattern, suggesting that functional diversification of ZmANK genes family. The results will present significant insights to explore ANK genes expression and function in future studies in maize. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84884207053	Genome-wide analysis of the CCCH zinc finger gene family in Medicago truncatula	Key message: In this study, we identified 34 CCCH Znf genes in Medicago truncatula and the results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression patterns of subfamily VI members were diverse. CCCH-type zinc finger (Znf) proteins are specific transcriptional factors with a typical motif consisting of three cysteine residues and one histidine residue. Increasing evidences have revealed that CCCH Znf proteins participated in the regulation of plant growth, developmental processes and environmental responses. Survey and characterization of CCCH Znf genes in leguminous species would facilitate a better understanding of the evolutionary processes and functions of this gene family. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of CCCH Znf genes in M. truncatula by describing the phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal location and gene structure of each family member. A total of 34 CCCH Znf genes were identified in the latest M. truncatula genome sequence. The 34 predicted members were clustered into nine subfamilies based on their phylogenetic analysis and structure features. In addition, the 34 Medicago CCCH Znf genes were found to be unevenly distributed on eight chromosomes. Furthermore, the expression profiles of subfamily VI were investigated under different stress conditions (PEG-6000, NaCl and ABA) by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The data showed that these genes displayed different expression levels in response to various stress conditions. The results presented in this study provide basic information about Medicago CCCH Znf genes and form a fundamental clue for cloning genes with specific functions in further studies and applications. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84884685690	Engineering soluble tobacco etch virus protease accompanies the loss of stability	Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) is a widely used tool enzyme in biological studies. To improve the solubility of recombinant TEVp, three variants, including the double mutant (L56V/S135G), the triple mutant (T17S/N68D/I77V), and the quintuple mutant (T17S/L56V/N68D/I77V/S135G), have been developed, however, with little information on functional stability. Here we investigated the solubility and stability of the three TEVp mutants under different temperature and denaturants, and in Escherichia coli with different cultural conditions. The quintuple mutant showed the highest solubility and thermostablity, and the double mutant was most resistant to the denaturants. The double mutant folded best in E. coli cells at 37 C with or without the co-expressed molecular chaperones GroEL, GroES and GrpE. The least soluble wild type TEVp displayed better tolerance to denaturants than the triple and the quintuple mutants. All results demonstrated that TEVp is not engineered to embody the most desirable solubility and stability by the current mutations. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84887224586	Molecular evolution of the HD-ZIP I gene family in legume genomes	Homeodomain leucine zipper I (HD-ZIP I) genes were used to increase the plasticity of plants by mediating external signals and regulating growth in response to environmental conditions. The way genomic histories drove the evolution of the HD-ZIP I family in legume species was described; HD-ZIP I genes were searched in Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula, Cajanus cajan and Phaseolus vulgaris, and then divided into five clades through phylogenetic analysis. Microsynteny analysis was made based on genomic segments containing the HD-ZIP I genes. Some pairs turned out to conform with syntenic genome regions, while others corresponded to those that were inverted, expanded, or contracted after the divergence of legumes. Besides, we dated their duplications by Ks analysis and demonstrated that all the blocks were formed after the monocot-dicot split; we observed Ka/Ks ratios representing strong purifying selections in the four legume species which might have been followed by gene loss and rearrangement. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84890357384	Downregulation of caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) by RNA interference leads to reduced lignin production in maize straw	Lignin is a major cell wall component of vascular plants that provides mechanical strength and hydrophobicity to vascular vessels. However, the presence of lignin limits the effective use of crop straw in many agroindustrial processes. Here, we generated transgenic maize plants in which the expression of a lignin biosynthetic gene encoding CCoAOMT, a key enzyme involved in the lignin biosynthesis pathway was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi of CCoAOMT led to significantly downregulated expression of this gene in transgenic maize compared with WT plants. These transgenic plants exhibited a 22.4% decrease in Klason lignin content and a 23.3% increase in cellulose content compared with WT plants, which may reflect compensatory regulation of lignin and cellulose deposition. We also measured the lignin monomer composition of the RNAi plants by GC-MS and determined that transgenic plants had a 57.08% higher S/G ratio than WT plants. In addition, histological staining of lignin with Wiesner reagent produced slightly more coloration in the xylem and sclerenchyma than WT plants. These results provide a foundation for breeding maize with low-lignin content and reveal novel insights about lignin regulation via genetic manipulation of CCoAOMT expression. © 2013, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

84892443698	Effects of low-temperature carbonization temperature and time on morphology of carbon particles from maize starch	Carbon particles retaining the morphology of native maize starch were prepared successfully in nitrogen by low-temperature carbonization (LTC) treatment and subsequent carbonization at 600 °C for 1 h. The as-prepared carbon particles were characterized by FESEM and the process of LTC was investigated by XRD, FTIR, DSC, TGA, and elemental analysis. The results indicate that the LTC treatment is mainly the process of starch dehydration and the LTC condition has crucial effects on the morphology of final carbon particles. When the maize starch was treated with proper LTC process, the carbon content of treated maize starch is more than 51 %, and the final carbon particles show good dispersity. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

84893603988	A genome-wide analysis of the AAAP gene family in maize	The AAAP (amino acid/auxin permease) genes encode a large family of transporters. A few members of the AAAP family have been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). However, little is known about AAAP genes in maize (Zea mays). Therefore, we performed a systematic bioinformatics analysis to characterize all AAAP genes in maize, which included analysis of the genome sequence, conserved protein domains, chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships, gene duplications, and gene expression profiles. In this study, seventy-one ZmAAAP genes were identified and named ZmAAAP01 to ZmAAAP71. The number of AAAP genes in maize is more than the number in Arabidopsis thaliana (43) and in rice (58). We found a higher percentage of AAAP gene duplications in the maize genome, which contributed to the expansion of the AAAP gene family. Furthermore, segmental duplications played a major role in the AAAP gene expansion in maize. The AAAP genes are unevenly distributed on the 10 maize chromosomes, and 31 of them are distributed within 12 clusters on segmental chromosomes. Both the EST analysis and transcriptome data indicated that most ZmAAAP genes exhibited abundant expression patterns, suggesting diverse and novel functions of AAAP gene family in maize. The results presented here provide useful information for further functional analysis of the AAAP gene family in maize. © 2014 Sheng L, et al.

84894751347	Effect of lime pretreatment and dry digestion on pyrolysis characteristics of rice straw	It was help to understand pyrolysis mechanism that biomass pyrolysis would be deeply studied. The change in pyrolysis characteristics of rice straw from lime pretreatment and dry digestion was discussed by using thermo-gravimetric analyzer. The results showed that lime pretreatment increased the relative content of lignin and hemicellulose. whereas dry digestion reduced the relative content of VS, cellulose and hemicellulose. The lime pretreatment and dry digestion changed pyrolysis characteristics of rice straw, but pyrolysis mechanism would not change at treated phase. The part of main weight loss was well modeled by the first-order kinetic equation, and the kinetic parameters of pyrolysis of rice straw was belonged to the usual range reported by literatures. The increase in activate energy appeared at pretreatment phase, whereas the decrease in activate energy occurred at digestion phase. This study provided useful parameters for the design of pyrolysis reactor for straw and its fermented residues combustion.

Main weight-loss was observed in smooth cordgrass at temperatures ranging from 200°C to 360°C, owing to release of 72%-74% of total volatiles. Pyrolysis characteristics such as distribution of pyrolysis products and thermal-decomposition rate significantly changed based on heating rate, but had no significant effect on the total yield of volatile matters. Activation energy was evaluated by four model-free methods, namely, Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and Kissinger methods. Experimental results showed that the activation energy obtained from the Kissinger method was in agreement with the average value of activation energy (183.6kJ/mol to 183.4kJ/mol) determined by FWO and KAS methods. Results of the master-plots method indicated that the most probable reaction model function was f (a)=(1-a)

84895485487	Genome-wide analysis of soybean HD-Zip gene family and expression profiling under salinity and drought treatments	Background: Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) proteins, a group of homeobox transcription factors, participate in various aspects of normal plant growth and developmental processes as well as environmental responses. To date, no overall analysis or expression profiling of the HD-Zip gene family in soybean (Glycine max) has been reported. Methods and Findings: An investigation of the soybean genome revealed 88 putative HD-Zip genes. These genes were classified into four subfamilies, I to IV, based on phylogenetic analysis. In each subfamily, the constituent parts of gene structure and motif were relatively conserved. A total of 87 out of 88 genes were distributed unequally on 20 chromosomes with 36 segmental duplication events, indicating that segmental duplication is important for the expansion of the HD-Zip family. Analysis of the Ka/Ks ratios showed that the duplicated genes of the HD-Zip family basically underwent purifying selection with restrictive functional divergence after the duplication events. Analysis of expression profiles showed that 80 genes differentially expressed across 14 tissues, and 59 HD-Zip genes are differentially expressed under salinity and drought stress, with 20 paralogous pairs showing nearly identical expression patterns and three paralogous pairs diversifying significantly under drought stress. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of six paralogous pairs of 12 selected soybean HD-Zip genes under both drought and salinity stress confirmed their stress-inducible expression patterns. Conclusions: This study presents a thorough overview of the soybean HD-Zip gene family and provides a new perspective on the evolution of this gene family. The results indicate that HD-Zip family genes may be involved in many plant responses to stress conditions. Additionally, this study provides a solid foundation for uncovering the biological roles of HD-Zip genes in soybean growth and development. © 2014 Chen et al.

84896057317	Identification and characterization of the SET domain gene family in maize	Histone lysine methylation plays a pivotal role in a variety of developmental and physiological processes through modifying chromatin structure and thereby regulating eukaryotic gene transcription. The SET domain proteins represent putative candidates for lysine methyltransferases containing the evolutionarily-conserved SET domain, and important epigenetic regulators present in eukaryotes. In recent years, increasing evidence reveals that SET domain proteins are encoded by a large multigene family in plants and investigation of the SET domain gene family will serve to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism diversity in plants. Although the SET domain gene family has been thoroughly characterized in multiple plant species including two model plant systems, Arabidopsis and rice, through their sequenced genomes, analysis of the entire SET domain gene family in maize was not completed following maize (B73) genome sequencing project. Here, we performed a genome-wide structural and evolutionary analysis of maize SET domain genes from the latest version of the maize (B73) genome. A complete set of 43 SET domain genes (Zmset1-43) were identified in the maize genome using Blast search tools and categorized into seven classes (Class I-VII) based on phylogeny. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are unevenly distributed on all ten chromosomes with seven segmental duplication events, suggesting that segmental duplication played a key role in expansion of the maize SET domain gene family. EST expression data mining revealed that these newly identified genes had temporal and spatial expression pattern and suggested that many maize SET domain genes play functional developmental roles in multiple tissues. Furthermore, the transcripts of the 18 genes (the Class V subfamily) were detected in the leaves by two different abiotic stress treatments using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The data demonstrated that these genes exhibited different expression levels in stress treatments. Overall, our study will serve to better understand the complexity of the maize SET domain gene family and also be beneficial for future experimental research to further unravel the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in plants. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

84900419205	Engineering uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase as a red fluorescent reporter in E. coli	Uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase (UMT) is a novel reporter owing to the catalytic products in the cells that emit strong red fluorescence under UV light. Here, we engineered the gene encoding the functional barley UMT (bUMT) by error-prone PCR and broadened the application UMT as a red fluorescent reporter in Escherichia coli. A variant, termed mbUMT, was selected and emitted stronger cell fluorescence than the wild type bUMT expressed in different E. coli strains, under different promoters and induction conditions respectively. The constructed mbUMT with a C-terminal ssrA tag was degraded in cells by the protease ClpXP encoded by E. coli chromosome, whereas the bUMT was expressed as active aggregates. Before they are exported to the periplasm, both proteins catalyze the substrate in the cytoplasm and emit cell fluorescence. The results suggested that the evolved bUMT is a better candidate to monitor in vivo degradation by E. coli ClpXP. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84899869587	Toxicity of 7-ketocholesterol on lethality, growth, reproduction, and germline apoptosis in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans	7-Ketocholesterol is one of the most abundant cholesterol oxides, and is known to be cytotoxic to various types of cultured mammalian cells; however, little is known regarding its effects in vivo. With the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as model organism, in vivo toxicity of 7-ketocholesterol was investigated. The aim of the study was to examine the effects on life span, as well as short-term effects on reproduction, thermotolerance, germline apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation resulting from C. elegans exposure to 7-ketocholesterol at concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 g/ml. Results indicated that 7-ketocholesterol reduced reproductive capacity, shortened the life span in a concentration-dependent manner, and impaired thermotolerance of the adult nematode. 7-Ketocholesterol also induced germline apoptotic cell death and increased ROS generation in adult worms. Thus, the model organism C. elegans is recommended for assessment of the safety and bioactivity of cholesterol oxides. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

84899532775	A new fusion protein platform for quantitatively measuring activity of multiple proteases	Background: Recombinant proteins fused with specific cleavage sequences are widely used as substrate for quantitatively analyzing the activity of proteases. Here we propose a new fusion platform for multiple proteases, by using diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase (DAL) as the fusion protein. It was based on the finding that a fused His6-tag could significantly decreases the activities of DAL from E. coli (eDAL) and Salmonella typhimurium (sDAL). Previously, we have shown that His6GST-tagged eDAL could be used to determine the activity of tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) under different temperatures or in the denaturant at different concentrations. In this report, we will assay different tags and cleavage sequences on DAL for expressing yield in E. coli, stability of the fused proteins and performance of substrate of other common proteases.Results: We tested seven different protease cleavage sequences (rhinovirus 3C, TEV protease, factor Xa, Ssp DnaB intein, Sce VMA1 intein, thrombin and enterokinase), three different tags (His6, GST, CBD and MBP) and two different DALs (eDAL and sDAL), for their performance as substrate to the seven corresponding proteases. Among them, we found four active DAL-fusion substrates suitable for TEVp, factor Xa, thrombin and DnaB intein. Enterokinase cleaved eDAL at undesired positions and did not process sDAL. Substitution of GST with MBP increase the expression level of the fused eDAL and this fusion protein was suitable as a substrate for analyzing activity of rhinovirus 3C. We demonstrated that SUMO protease Ulp1 with a N-terminal His6-tag or MBP tag displayed different activity using the designed His6SUMO-eDAL as substrate. Finally, owing to the high level of the DAL-fusion protein in E. coli, these protein substrates can also be detected directly from the crude extract.Conclusion: The results show that our designed DAL-fusion proteins can be used to quantify the activities of both sequence- and conformational-specific proteases, with sufficient substrate specificity. © 2014 Zhou et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84902449264	A novel maize homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) i gene, Zmhdz10, positively regulates drought and salt tolerance in both rice and arabidopsis	Increasing evidence suggests that homeodomain-leucine zipper I (HD-Zip) I transcription factors play important roles in abiotic stress responses, but no HD-Zip I proteins have been reported in maize. Here, a drought-induced HD-Zip I gene, Zmhdz10, was isolated from maize and characterized for its role in stress responses. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that expression of Zmhdz10 was also induced by salt stress and ABA. Transient expression of Zmhdz10-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in onion cells showed a nuclear localization of Zmhdz10. Yeast hybrid assays demonstrated that Zmhdz10 has transactivation and DNA-binding activity in yeast cells. Overexpression of Zmhdz10 in rice led to enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses and increased sensitivity to ABA. Moreover, Zmhdz10 transgenic plants had lower relative electrolyte leakage (REL), lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased proline content relative to wild-type plants under stress conditions, which may contribute to enhanced stress tolerance. Zmhdz10 transgenic Arabidopsis plants also exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses that was concomitant with altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes, including Δ1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1 (P5CS1), Responsive to dehydration 22 (RD22), Responsive to dehydration 29B (RD29B) and ABA-insensitive 1 (ABI1). Taken together, these results suggest that Zmhdz10 functions as a transcriptional regulator that can positively regulate drought and salt tolerance in plants through an ABA-dependent signaling pathway. © 2014 The Author.

84901774721	Different evolutionary patterns among intronless genes in maize genome	Intronless genes, as a characteristic feature of prokaryotes, are an important resource for the study of the evolution of gene architecture in eukaryotes. In the study, 14,623 (36.87%) intronless genes in maize were identified and the percentage is greater than that of other monocots and algae. The number of maize intronless genes on each chromosome has a significant linear correlation with the number of total genes on the chromosome and the length of the chromosomes. Intronless genes in maize play important roles in translation and energy metabolism. Evolutionary analysis revealed that 2601 intronless genes conserved among the three domains of life and 2323 intronless genes that had no homology with genes of other species. These two sets of intronless genes were distinct in genetic features, physical locations and function. These results provided a useful source to understand the evolutionary patterns of related genes and genomes and some intronless genes are good candidates for subsequent functional analyses specifically. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84904618108	Genome duplication and gene loss affect the evolution of heat shock transcription factor genes in legumes	Whole-genome duplication events (polyploidy events) and gene loss events have played important roles in the evolution of legumes. Here we show that the vast majority of Hsf gene duplications resulted from whole genome duplication events rather than tandem duplication, and significant differences in gene retention exist between species. By searching for intraspecies gene colinearity (microsynteny) and dating the age distributions of duplicated genes, we found that genome duplications accounted for 42 of 46 Hsf-containing segments in Glycine max, while paired segments were rarely identified in Lotus japonicas, Medicago truncatula and Cajanus cajan. However, by comparing interspecies microsynteny, we determined that the great majority of Hsf-containing segments in Lotus japonicas, Medicago truncatula and Cajanus cajan show extensive conservation with the duplicated regions of Glycine max. These segments formed 17 groups of orthologous segments. These results suggest that these regions shared ancient genome duplication with Hsf genes in Glycine max, but more than half of the copies of these genes were lost. On the other hand, the Glycine max Hsf gene family retained approximately 75% and 84% of duplicated genes produced from the ancient genome duplication and recent Glycine-specific genome duplication, respectively. Continuous purifying selection has played a key role in the maintenance of Hsf genes in Glycine max. Expression analysis of the Hsf genes in Lotus japonicus revealed their putative involvement in multiple tissue-/developmental stages and responses to various abiotic stimuli. This study traces the evolution of Hsf genes in legume species and demonstrates that the rates of gene gain and loss are far from equilibrium in different species. © 2014 Lin et al.

Overexpression of UMT confers resistance of the Escherichia coli cells to potassium tellurite that inhibits cell growth. In this study, we applied UMT reporter for monitoring protein solubility of MBP or TEV protease variants under different expression conditions, as well as 12 maize proteins with either the designed linker or N-terminal SUMO tag. Effects of five enzymes involved in heme and siroheme biosynthesis on the reporter were also investigated. With increasing concentrations of potassium tellurite, colony numbers of the mixed cells expressing the selected five proteins with different solubility were decreased, but colonies displaying red fluorescence was identified to be produced the protein with relatively high solubility. The developed UMT reporter system is sensitive for monitoring protein solubility based on coupled fluorescence and chemical selection. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although many databases on exons and introns exist, there is currently no cohesive database that collects intronless genes in plants into a single database.Description: In this study, we present the Poaceae Intronless Genes Database (PIGD), a user-friendly web interface to explore information on intronless genes from different plants. Five Poaceae species, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, Setaria italica, Panicum virgatum and Brachypodium distachyon, are included in the current release of PIGD. Gene annotations and sequence data were collected and integrated from different databases. The primary focus of this study was to provide gene descriptions and gene product records. In addition, functional annotations, subcellular localization prediction and taxonomic distribution are reported. PIGD allows users to readily browse, search and download data. BLAST and comparative analyses are also provided through this online database, which is available at http://pigd.ahau.edu.cn/.Conclusion: PIGD provides a solid platform for the collection, integration and analysis of intronless genes in the Poaceae. As such, this database will be useful for subsequent bio-computational analysis in comparative genomics and evolutionary studies.

The chemical composition analysis and structural properties determination by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy further confirmed that microwave pretreatment could disrupt the silicified waxy surface, break down lignin-hemicellulose complex and partially remove silicon and lignin, which could be favorable for the enhancement of enzymatic saccharification of rice straw and reduction of its adsorption of enzymes.

84911917757	Physicochemical changes of rice straw after lime pretreatment and mesophilic dry digestion	A better understanding of the physicochemical properties of the material, its changes and the effects of anaerobic digestion, will help to improve methane production efficiency. The physicochemical changes of rice straw after solid-state lime pretreatment and dry digestion were investigated. Those changes were revealed by the composition of the substrate before any treatment, from samples of the material during the process and by the final product. Such compositions were studied with X-ray, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyzes. The obtained results showed that low mass transfer limited the lignin modification and polysaccharide decomposition, resulted in a low biogas yield; and that after pretreatment and 60 days of mesophilic dry digestion, the concentration of cellulose decreased (23.4%) as well as hemicellulose (13.1%). In the opposite case, the concentration of lignin increased (59%) as well as ash (108%). The crystallinity index increased by 5.4% after pretreatment and decreased by 4.8% after digestion. The FTIR spectrogram of the raw sample included a peak reflecting absorption of ester linkages. This peak was absent from FTIR spectra of pretreated and digested samples, indicating that such linkages are broken during pretreatment and then digested by the microorganisms during the anaerobic fermentation. Furthermore, lime pretreatment and dry digestion significantly changed the decomposed profiles and rate, the distribution of pyrolysis product. The obtained data showed that polysaccharides and lignin were decomposed during pretreatment and digestion phases, leading to changes in structural and thermal properties.

84911992023	Overexpression of a maize WRKY58 gene enhances drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice	WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are reported to play crucial roles in the processes of plant growth and development, defense regulation and stress responses. In this study, a WRKY group IId TF, designated ZmWRKY58, was isolated from maize (Zea mays L.). Expression pattern analysis revealed that ZmWRKY58 was induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid treatments. Subcellular localization experiments in onion epidermal cells showed the presence of ZmWRKY58 in the nucleus. Overexpression of ZmWRKY58 in rice resulted in delayed germination and inhibited post-germination development. Further investigation showed that ZmWRKY58 overexpressing transgenic plants had higher survival rates and relative water contents, but lower malonaldehyde contents and relative electrical leakage compared with wild-type plants, following drought and salt stress treatments, suggesting that overexpression of ZmWRKY58 leads to enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses in transgenic rice. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid assay showed that ZmWRKY58 could interact with ZmCaM2, suggesting that ZmWRKY58 may function as a calmodulin binding protein. Taken together, these results suggest that ZmWRKY58 may act as a positive regulator involved in the drought and salt stress responses.

Nevertheless, the role of expansins in the expansion and development of endosperm—a major seed component whose cell size is significantly associated with grain yield—is poorly understood. To explore associated biological processes and the evolution of expansins in maize, we performed a systematic analysis of the expansin gene family encompassing gene structure, phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene duplication, and gene ontology. A total of 88 maize expansin genes (ZmEXPs) were identified and categorized into three subfamilies according to their phylogenetic relationships. Expression patterns of ZmEXPs were also investigated in nine different tissues by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of eight ZmEXPs was detected in endosperm, with five showing endosperm-specific expression. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze expression patterns of the eight ZmEXPs in endosperm (10 days after pollination) under abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA

84922335917	Cloning and Characterization of a Multifunctional Promoter from Maize (Zea mays L.)	The use of tissue-specific promoters to drive the expression of target genes during certain developmental stages or in specific organs can prevent unnecessary gene expression caused by constitutive promoters. Utilizing heterologous promoters to regulate the expression of genes in transgenic receptors can help prevent gene silencing. Here, we engineered heterologous maize promoters that regulate gene-specific expression in rice plant receptors. We performed a histochemical and quantitative β-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis of the Zea mays legumin1 (ZM-LEGF) gene promoter and detailed detection of stably transformed rice expressing the GUS gene under the control of the promoter of ZM-LEGF (pZM-LEGF) and its truncated promoters throughout development. When the promoter sequence was truncated, the location and intensity of GUS expression changed. The results suggest that the sequence from −140 to +41 is a critical region that confers the expression of the entire promoter. Truncation of pZM-LEG (3′-deleted region of pZM-LEGF) markedly increased the GUS activity, with the core cis-elements located in the −273 to −140 regions, namely pZM-LEG6. Detailed analysis of pZM-LEG6::GUS T
