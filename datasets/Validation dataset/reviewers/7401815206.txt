16344393155	Structure, divergence, and distribution of the CRR centromeric retrotransposon family in rice	The centromeric retrotransposon (CR) family in the grass species is one of few Ty3-gypsy groups of retroelements that preferentially transpose into highly specialized chromosomal domains. It has been demonstrated in both rice and maize that CRR (CR of rice) and CRM (CR of maize) elements are intermingled with centromeric satellite DNA and are highly concentrated within cytologically defined centromeres. We collected all of the CRR elements from rice chromosomes 1, 4, 8, and 10 that have been sequenced to high quality. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CRR elements are structurally diverged into four subfamilies, including two autonomous subfamilies (CRR1 and CRR2) and two nonautonomous subfamilies (noaCRR1 and noaCRR2). The CRR1/CRR2 elements contain all characteristic protein domains required for retrotransposition. In contrast, the noaCRR elements have different structures, containing only a gag or gag-pro domain or no open reading frames. The CRR and noaCRR elements share substantial sequence similarity in regions required for DNA replication and for recognition by integrase during retrotransposition. These data, coupled with the presence of young noaCRR elements in the rice genome and similar chromosomal distribution patterns between noaCRR1 and CRR1/CRR2 elements, suggest that the noaCRR elements were likely mobilized through the retrotransposition machinery from the autonomous CRR elements. Mechanisms of the targeting specificity of the CRR elements, as well as their role in centromere function, are discussed. © Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution 2004; all rights reserved.

1542531592	A New Set of Primary Trisomies in indica Rice, Its Breeding and Cytological Investigation	For developing primary trisomies a midseason variety of indica rice Zhongxian 3037 was treated with 0.2% colchicine solution at seedling stage. A triploid plant was obtained from its offspring in 1991. The triploid was in vitro propagated on culture medium. After pollenation with the pollen of diploid plants of the same variety, 3013 seeds were harvested in 1992. From these seeds 1063 plants were obtained and chromosome number checking was conducted for each plant in meiosis. A total of 302 plants were confirmed to be trisomic plants among which 12 primary trisomies were successfully isolated and being designated as triplo-1, triplo-2⋯ ⋯and triplo-12 according to the length of additional chromosomes. Each primary trisomic was maintained in test tube with tissue culture techniques.

21044436749	The tomato sequencing project, the first cornerstone of the International Solanaceae Project (SOL)	The genome of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is being sequenced by an international consortium of 10 countries (Korea, China, the United Kingdom, India, The Netherlands, France, Japan, Spain, Italy and the United States) as part of a larger initiative called the 'International Solanaceae Genome Project (SOL): Systems Approach to Diversity and Adaptation'. The goal of this grassroots initiative, launched in November 2003, is to establish a network of information, resources and scientists to ultimately tackle two of the most significant questions in plant biology and agriculture: (1) How can a common set of genes/proteins give rise to a wide range of morphologically and ecologically distinct organisms that occupy our planet? (2) How can a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of plant diversity be harnessed to better meet the needs of society in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner? The Solanaceae and closely related species such as coffee, which are included in the scope of the SOL project, are ideally suited to address both of these questions. The first step of the SOL project is to use an ordered BAC approach to generate a high quality sequence for the euchromatic portions of the tomato as a reference for the Solanaceae. Due to the high level of macro and micro-synteny in the Solanaceae the BAC-by-BAC tomato sequence will form the framework for shotgun sequencing of other species. The starting point for sequencing the genome is BACs anchored to the genetic map by overgo hybridization and AFLP technology. The overgos are derived from approximately 1500 markers from the tomato high density F2-2000 genetic map (http://sgn.cornell.edu/). These seed BACs will be used as anchors from which to radiate the tiling path using BAC end sequence data. Annotation will be performed according to SOL project guidelines. All the information generated under the SOL umbrella will be made available in a comprehensive website. The information will be interlinked with the ultimate goal that the comparative biology of the Solanaceae - and beyond - achieves a context that will facilitate a systems biology approach.

0031155834	Cytological identification of an isotetrasomic in rice and its application to centromere mapping	The aneuploid with isochromosome or telochromosome is ideal material for exploring the position of centromere in lingkage map. For obtaining these aneuploids in rice, the primary trisomies from triplo-1 to triplo-12 and the aneuploids derived from a triploid of indica rice variety Zhongxian 3037 were carefully investigated. From the offsprings of triplo-10, a primary trisomic of chromosome 10 of the variety, an isotetrasomic "triplo- 10- 1" was obtained. Cytological investigation revealed that a pair of extra isochromosomes of triplo-10-1 were come from the short arm of chromosome 10. In the offsprings of the isotetrasomic, a secondary trisomic "triplo-10-2" , in which the extra- chromosome was an isochromosome derived from the short arm of chromosome 10, was identified. With the isotetrasomic, secondary trisomic, primary trisomic and diploid of variety Zhongxian 3037, different molecular markers were used for exploring the position of the centromere of chromosome 10. Based on the DNA dosage effect, it was verified that the molecular markers G1125, G333 and L169 were located on the short arm, G1084 and other 16 available molecular markers were on the long arm of chromosome 10. So the centromere of chromosome 10 was located somewhere betweenG1125 and G1084 according to the RFLP linkage map given by Kurata et al[1]. The distance from G1125 to G1084 was about 3.2cM.

23844434604	Chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning reveals rapid evolutionary patterns of centromeric DNA in Oryza species	The functional centromeres of rice (Oryza sativa, AA genome) chromosomes contain two key DNA components: the CRR centromeric retrotransposons and a 155-bp satellite repeat, CentO. However, several wild Oryza species lack the CentO repeat. We developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based technique to clone DNA fragments derived from chromatin containing the centromeric histone H3 variant CenH3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning was carried out in the CentO-less species Oryza rhizomatis (CC genome) and Oryza brachyantha (FF genome). Three previously uncharacterized genome-specific satellite repeats, CentO-C1, CentO-C2, and CentO-F, were discovered in the centromeres of these two species. An 80-bp DNA region was found to be conserved in CentO-C1, CentO, and centromeric satellite repeats from maize and pearl millet, species which diverged from rice many millions of years ago. In contrast, the CentO-F repeat shows no sequence similarity to other centromeric repeats but has almost completely replaced other centromeric sequences in O. brachyantha, including the CRR-related sequences that normally constitute a significant fraction of the centromeric DNA in grass species. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

24944497900	A tiling microarray expression analysis of rice chromosome 4 suggests a chromosome-level regulation of transcription	The complete genome sequence of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the biology of this model cereal. An essential and necessary step in this effort is the determination of the coding information and expression patterns of each sequenced chromosome. Here, we report an analysis of the transcriptional activity of rice chromosome 4 using a tiling path microarray based on PCR-generated genomic DNA fragments. Six representative rice organ types were examined using this microarray to catalog the transcribed regions of rice chromosome 4 and to reveal organ- and developmental stage-specific transcription patterns. This analysis provided expression support for 82% of the gene models in the chromosome. Transcriptional activities in 1643 nonannotated regions were also detected. Comparison with cytologically defined chromatin features indicated that in juvenile-stage rice the euchromatic region is more actively transcribed than is the transposon-rich heterochromatic portion of the chromosome. Interestingly, increased transcription of transposon-related gene models in certain heterochromatic regions was observed in mature-stage rice organs and in suspension-cultured cells. These results suggest a close correlation between transcriptional activity and chromosome organization and the developmental regulation of transcription activity at the chromosome level. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.

27244458110	Complex organization and evolution of the tomato pericentromeric region at the FER gene locus	Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is a model species for molecular biology research and a candidate for large-scale genome sequencing. Pericentromeric heterochromatin constitutes a large portion of the tomato chromosomes. However, the knowledge of the structure, organization, and evolution of such regions remains very limited. Here, we report the analysis of a 198-kb sequence near the FER gene, located in a distal part of pericentromeric heterochromatin on the long arm of tomato chromosome 6. Nine genes, one pseudogene, and 55 transposable elements (TEs) were identified, showing a low gene density (19.8 kb/gene) and a high content of transposable elements (>45% of the sequence). Six genes (56B23_g3, g5, g7, g8, g9, and g10) have perfect matches (>98% identity) with tomato expressed sequence tags. Two genes (56B23_g1 and g6), which share <98% sequence identity with expressed sequence tags, were confirmed for transcriptional activity by reverse transcription-PCR. The genes were not uniformly distributed along the sequence and grouped into gene islands separated by stretches of retrotransposons, forming a pattern similar to that found in the gene-rich regions of the large genomes of maize (Zea mays) and Triticeae. Long terminal repeat retrotransposons account for 60% of the TE sequence length. Sixteen of 55 TEs were completely new and remain unclassified. Surprisingly, five of the seven identified DNA transposons were closely associated with coding regions. The action of transposable elements and DNA rearrangements form the molecular basis of the dynamic genome evolution at the FER locus. Multiple rounds of genome duplication in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and subsequent gene loss have generated a mosaic pattern of conservation between tomato and Arabidopsis orthologous sequences. Our data show that the distal parts of pericentromeric heterochromatin may contain many valuable genes and that these regions form an evolutionary active part of the tomato genome. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.

28844473568	A study of the number of SAT-chromosome in rice	The number of SAT-chromosome of some species or varieties in rice has been studied. It is found that there are some differences in SAT-chromosome number among different rice genomes, i.e. AA with 1-2 pairs, BB with 3 pairs, CC with 2 pairs, BBCC with 4 pairs and CCDD with 2 pairs. There are also differences among different varieties of O. sativa. Generally speaking, there are two pairs of SAT-chromosomes in indica rice, i.e. chromosome 10 and 12. But there is only one pair of SAT-chromosome in japonica rice, i.e. chromosome 10.

3042513368	Structural features of the rice chromosome 4 centromere	A complete sequence of a chromosome centromere is necessary for fully understanding centromere function. We reported the sequence structures of the first complete rice chromosome centromere through sequencing a large insert bacterial artificial chromosome clone-based contig, which covered the rice chromosome 4 centromere. Complete sequencing of the 124-kb rice chromosome 4 centromere revealed that it consisted of 18 tracts of 379 tandemly arrayed repeats known as CentO and a total of 19 centromeric retroelements (CRs) but no unique sequences were detected. Four tracts, composed of 65 CentO repeats, were located in the opposite orientation, and 18 CentO tracts were flanked by 19 retroelements. The CRs were classified into four types, and the type I retroelements appeared to be more specific to rice centromeres. The preferential insert of the CRs among CentO repeats indicated that the centromere-specific retroelements may contribute to centromere expansion during evolution. The presence of three intact retrotransposons in the centromere suggests that they may be responsible for functional centromere initiation through a transcription-mediated mechanism. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.

33644791631	The transcribed 165-bp CentO satellite is the major functional centromeric element in the wild rice species Oryza punctata	Centromeres are required for faithful segregation of chromosomes in cell division. It is not clear what kind of sequences act as functional centromeres and how centromere sequences are organized in Oryza punctata, a BB genome species. In this study, we found that the CentO centromeric satellites in O. punctata share high homology with the CentO satellites in O. sativa. The O. punctata centromeres are characterized by megabase tandem arrays that are flanked by centromere-specific retrotransposons. Immunostaining with an antibody specific to CENH3 indicates that the 165-bp CentO satellites are the major component for functional centromeres. Moreover, both strands of CentO satellites are highly methylated and transcribed and produce small interfering RNA, which may be important for the maintenance of centromeric heterochromatin and centromere function. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.

33646170036	Euchromatin and pericentromeric heterochromatin: Comparative composition in the tomato genome	Eleven sequenced BACs were annotated and localized via FISH to tomato pachytene chromosomes providing the first global insights into the compositional differences of euchromatin and pericentromeric heterochromatin in this model dicot species. The results indicate that tomato euchromatin has a gene density (6.7 kb/gene) similar to that of Arabidopsis and rice. Thus, while the euchromatin comprises only 25% of the tomato nuclear DNA, it is sufficient to account for ∼90% of the estimated 38,000 non-transposon genes that compose the tomato genome. Moreover, euchromatic BACs were largely devoid of transposons or other repetitive elements. In contrast, BACs assigned to the pericentromeric heterochromatin had a gene density 10-100 times lower than that of the euchromatin and are heavily populated by retrotransposons preferential to the heterochromatin - the most abundant transposons belonging to the Jinling Ty3/gypsy -like retrotransposon family. Jinling elements are highly methylated and rarely transcribed. Nonetheless, they have spread throughout the pericentromeric heterochromatin in tomato and wild tomato species fairly recently - well after tomato diverged from potato and other related solanaceous species. The implications of these findings on evolution and on sequencing the genomes of tomato and other solanaceous species are discussed. Copyright © 2006 by the Genetics Society of America.

33646938757	GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice	Lignin content and composition are two important agronomic traits for the utilization of agricultural residues. Rice (Oryza sativa) gold hull and internode phenotype is a classical morphological marker trait that has long been applied to breeding and genetics study. In this study, we have cloned the GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 (GH2) gene in rice using a map-based cloning approach. The result shows that the gh2 mutant is a lignin-deficient mutant, and GH2 encodes a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity. When expressed in Escherichia coli, purified recombinant GH2 was found to exhibit strong catalytic ability toward coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde, while the mutant protein gh2 completely lost the corresponding CAD and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities. Further phenotypic analysis of the gh2 mutant plants revealed that the p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and sinapyl monomers were reduced in almost the same ratio compared to the wild type. Our results suggest GH2 acts as a primarily multifunctional CAD to synthesize coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol precursors in rice lignin biosynthesis. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.

33646559573	Diversity of centromeric repeats in two closely related wild rice species, Oryza officinalis and Oryzarhizomatis	Oryza officinalis (CC, 2n = 24) and Oryza rhizomatis (CC, 2n = 24) belong to the Oryza genus, which contains more than 20 identified wild rice species. Although much has been known about the molecular composition and organization of centromeres in Oryza sativa, relatively little is known of its wild relatives. In the present study, we isolated and characterized a 126-bp centromeric satellite (CentO-C) from three bacterial artificial chromosomes of O. officinalis. In addition to CentO-C, low abundance of CentO satellites is also present in O. officinalis. In order to determine the chromosomal locations and distributions of CentO-C (126-bp), CentO (155 bp) and TrsC (366 bp) satellite within O. officinalis, fluorescence in situ hybridization examination was done on pachytene or metaphase I chromosomes. We found that only ten centromeres (excluding centromere 7 and 2) contain CentO-C arrays in O. officinalis, while centromere 7 comprises CentO satellites, and centromere 2 is devoid of any detectable satellites. For TrsC satellites, it was detected at multiple subtelomeric regions in O. officinalis, however, in O. rhizomatis, TrsC sequences were detected both in the four centromeric regions (CEN 3, 4, 10, 11) and the multiple subtelomeric regions. Therefore, these data reveal the evolutionary diversification pattern of centromere DNA within/or between close related species, and could provide an insight into the dynamic evolutionary processes of rice centromere. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33745618997	BUD2, encoding an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, is required for Arabidopsis growth and development	Polyamines are implicated in regulating various developmental processes in plants, but their exact roles and how they govern these processes still remain elusive. We report here an Arabidopsis bushy and dwarf mutant, bud2, which results from the complete deletion of one member of the small gene family that encodes S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases (SAMDCs) necessary for the formation of the indispensable intermediate in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. The bud2 plant has enlarged vascular systems in inflorescences, roots, and petioles, and an altered homeostasis of polyamines. The double mutant of bud2 and samdc1, a knockdown mutant of another SAMDC member, is embryo lethal, demonstrating that SAMDCs are essential for plant embryogenesis. Our results suggest that polyamines are required for the normal growth and development of higher plants. © 2006 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

33749821263	Adapting rice anther culture to gene transformation and RNA interference	Anther culture offers a rapid method of generating homozygous lines for breeding program and genetic analysis. To produce homozygous transgenic lines of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in one step, we developed an efficient protocol of anther-callus-based transformation mediated by Agrobacterium after optimizing several factors influencing efficient transformation, including callus induction and Agrobacterium density for co-cultivation. Using this protocol, we obtained 145 independent green transformants from five cultivars of japonica rice by transformation with a binary vector pCXK1301 bearing the rice gene, Xa21 for resistance to bacterial blight, of which 140 were further confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization analysis, including haploids (32.1%), diploids (62.1%) and mixoploids (7.5%). Fifteen diploids were found to be doubled haploids, which accounted for 10.7% of the total positive lines. Finally, by including 28 from colchicine induced or spontaneous diploidization of haploids later after transformation, a total of 43 doubled haploids (30.7%) of Xa21 transgenic lines were obtained. We also generated two RNAi transgenic haploids of the rice OsMADS2 gene, a putative redundant gene of OsMADS4 based on their sequence similarity, to investigate its possible roles in rice flower development by this method. Flowers from the two OsMADS2 RNAi transgenic haploids displayed obvious homeotic alternations, in which lodicules were transformed into palea/lemma-like tissues, whereas identities of other floral organs were maintained. The phenotypic alternations were proved to result from specific transcriptional suppression of OsMADS2 gene by the introduced RNAi transgene. The results confirmed that OsMADS2 is involved in lodicule development of rice flower and functionally redundant with OsMADS4 gene. Our results demonstrated that rice anther culture could be adapted to gene transformation and RNAi analysis in rice. © 2006 Science in China Press.

34347211813	Heterochromatic and genetic features are consistent with recombination suppression of the self-incompatibility locus in Antirrhinum	Self-incompatibility (SI) is a genetic mechanism to prevent self-fertilization that is found in many species of flowering plants. Molecular studies have demonstrated that the S-RNase and SLF/SFB genes encoded by the single polymorphic S locus, which control the pollen and pistil functions of SI in three distantly related families, the Solanaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Rosaceae, are organized in a haplotype-specific manner. Previous work suggested that the haplotype structure of the two genes is probably maintained by recombination suppression at the S locus. To examine features associated with this suppression, we first mapped the S locus of Antirrhinum hispanicum, a member of the Scrophulariaceae, to a highly heterochromatic region close to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 8. Both leptotene chromosome and DNA fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses showed an obvious haplotype specificity of the Antirrhinum S locus that is consistent with its haplotype structure. A chromosome inversion was also detected around this region between A. majus and A. hispanicum. These results revealed that DNA sequence polymorphism and a heterochromatic location are associated with the S locus. Possible roles of these features in maintenance of the haplotype specificity involved in both self and non-self recognition are discussed. © 2007 The Authors.

34347237838	Identification of chromosomes from multiple rice genomes using a universal molecular cytogenetic marker system	To develop reliable techniques for chromosome identification is critical for cytogenetic research, especially for genomes with a large number and smaller-sized chromosomes. An efficient approach using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones as molecular cytological markers has been developed for many organisms. Herein, we present a set of chromosomal arm-specific molecular cytological markers derived from the gene-enriched regions of the sequenced rice genome. All these markers are able to generate very strong signals on the pachytene chromosomes of Oryza sativa L. (AA genome) when used as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. We further probed those markers to the pachytene chromosomes of O. punctata (BB genome) and O. officinalis (CC genome) and also got very strong signals on the relevant pachytene chromosomes. The signal position of each marker on the related chromosomes from the three different rice genomes was pretty much stable, which enabled us to identify different chromosomes among various rice genomes. We also constructed the karyotype for both O. punctata and O. officinalis with the BB and CC genomes, respectively, by analysis of 10 pachytene cells anchored by these chromosomal arm-specific markers. © 2007 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

0033805678	B chromosome in a rice aneuploid variation	An awned rice plant was discovered among the progeny of the triploid Zhongxian 3037. Cytological investigation showed that this awned plant was a variation with extra chromosomes. Based on the properties of the extra chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis - e.g., short stature, darkly staining, instability in chromosome number, and lack of synapsis with A chromosomes - they could be considered to be B chromosomes in rice. The B chromosome(s) in both asexual and sexual progenies exhibited a unique segregation that is different from that of telotrisomics and other aneuploids. Moreover molecular marker analysis detected no dosage effects between the B-chromosome plant and the normal diploid of Zhongxian 3037, indicating that the B chromosomes might not be directly derived from any A-chromosome fragments in rice.

34247630796	SDG714, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, is involved in Tos17 DNA methylation and transposition in rice	Although the role of H3K9 methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) is unclear, in Arabidopsis thaliana the loss of histone H3K9 methylation by mutation of Kryptonite [also known as SU(VAR)3-9 homolog] reduces genome-wide DNA methylation and increases the transcription of transposable elements. Here, we report that rice SDG714 (for SET Domain Group Protein714) encodes a histone H3K9-specific methyltransferase. The C terminus of SDG714 confers enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, whereas the N terminus localizes it in the nucleus. Loss-of-function mutants of SDG714 (SDG714IR transformants) generated by RNA interference display a mostly glabrous phenotype as a result of the lack of macro trichomes in glumes, leaves, and culms compared with control plants. These mutants also show decreased levels of CpG and CNG cytosine methylation as well as H3K9 methylation at the Tos17 locus, a copia-like retrotransposon widely used for the generation of rice mutants. Most interestingly, loss of function of SDG714 can enhance transcription and cause the transposition of Tos17. Together, these results suggest that histone H3K9 methylation mediated by SDG714 is involved in DNA methylation, the transposition of transposable elements, and genome stability in rice. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.

34249101182	Characterization and fine mapping of the ibf mutant in rice	The pigment is an important character in plant development. In the present study, we characterized and fine mapped one inhibitor for brown furrows gene (ibf) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In the ibf mutant, brown pigments specifically accumulate in the furrows of hulls as seeds mature and reach a maximum level in dry seeds. Genetic analysis showed that the mutant phenotype is controlled by one recessive nuclear gene, which was finally mapped in a 90-kb region on the long arm of chromosome 9. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting analysis revealed that there was a 26 kb deletion in the 90-kb region in the mutant. Since all the open reading frames outside the gap in the delimited region had no detectable difference in DNA sequence with the wild-type, we postulated that the ibf locus should be located in the gap. Through gene annotation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, we selected OsKF1 encoding a kelch repeat-containing F-box family protein as the candidate gene of ibf. © 2007 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

60549104200	Comparative sequence analysis of MONOCULM1-orthologous regions in 14 Oryza genomes	Comparative genomics is a powerful tool to decipher gene and genome evolution. Placing multiple genome comparisons in a phylogenetic context improves the sensitivity of evolutionary inferences. In the genus Oryza, this comparative approach can be used to investigate gene function, genome evolution, domestication, polyploidy, and ecological adaptation. A large genomic region surrounding the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) locus was chosen for study in 14 Oryza species, including 10 diploids and 4 allotetraploids. Sequencing and annotation of 18 bacterial artificial chromosome clones for these species revealed highly conserved gene colinearity and structure in the MOC1 region. Since the Oryza radiation about 14 Mya, differences in transposon amplification appear to be responsible for the different current sizes of the Oryza genomes. In the MOC1 region, transposons were only conserved between genomes of the same type (e.g., AA or BB). In addition to the conserved gene content, several apparent genes have been generated de novo or uniquely retained in the AA lineage. Two different 3-gene segments have been inserted into the MOC1 region of O. coarctata (KK) or O. sativa by unknown mechanism(s). Large and apparently noncoding sequences flanking the MOC1 gene were observed to be under strong purifying selection. The allotetraploids Oryza alta and Oryza minuta were found to be products of recent polyploidization, less than 1.6 and 0.4 Mya, respectively. In allotetraploids, pseudogenization of duplicated genes was common, caused by large deletions, small frame-shifting insertions/deletions, or nonsense mutations. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

41849120789	Mutations of genes in synthesis of the carotenoid precursors of ABA lead to pre-harvest sprouting and photo-oxidation in rice	Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) or vivipary in cereals is an important agronomic trait that results in significant economic loss. A considerable number of mutations that cause PHS have been identified in several species. However, relatively few viviparous mutants in rice (Oryza sativa L.) have been reported. To explore the mechanism of PHS in rice, we carried out an extensive genetic screening and identified 12 PHS mutants (phs). Based on their phenotypes, these phs mutants were classified into three groups. Here we characterize in detail one of these groups, which contains mutations in genes encoding major enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, including phytoene desaturase (OsPDS), ζ-carotene desaturase (OsZDS), carotenoid isomerase (OsCRTISO) and lycopene β-cyclase (β-OsLCY), which are essential for the biosynthesis of carotenoid precursors of ABA. As expected, the amount of ABA was reduced in all four phs mutants compared with that in the wild type. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis revealed the occurrence of photoinhibition in the photosystem and decreased capacity for eliminating excess energy by thermal dissipation. The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the Oscrtiso/phs3-1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo-oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants. These results suggest that the impairment of carotenoid biosynthesis causes photo-oxidation and ABA-deficiency phenotypes, of which the latter is a major factor controlling the PHS trait in rice. © 2008 The Authors.

46749108756	Cytological characterization of the tandem repetitive sequences and their methylation status in the Antirrhinum majus genome	Tandem repetitive sequences are DNA motifs common in the genomes of eukaryotic species and are often embedded in heterochromatic regions. In most eukaryotes, ribosomal genes, as well as centromeres and telomeres or subtelomeres, are associated with abundant tandem arrays of repetitive sequences and typically represent the final barriers to completion of whole-genome sequencing. The nature of these repeats makes it difficult to estimate their actual sizes. In this study, combining the two cytological techniques DNA fiber-FISH and pachytene chromosome FISH allowed us to characterize the tandem repeats distributed genome wide in Antirrhinum majus and identify four types of tandem repeats, 45S rDNA, 5S rDNA, CentA1, and CentA2, representing the major tandem repetitive components, which were estimated to have a total length of 18.50 Mb and account for 3.59% of the A. majus genome. FISH examination revealed that all the tandem repeats correspond to heterochromatic knobs along the pachytene chromosomes. Moreover, the methylation status of the tandem repeats was investigated in both somatic cells and pollen mother cells from anther tissues using an antibody against 5-methylcytosine combined with sequential FISH analyses. Our results showed that these repeats were hypomethylated in anther tissues, especially in the pollen mother cells at pachytene stage. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we characterized two rice (Oryza sativa) allelic rolled-leaf mutants, rolled leaf 9-1 (rl9-1) and rl9-2, which display very similar phenotypes with completely adaxialized leaves and malformed spikelets. We cloned the RL9 gene by way of a map-based cloning strategy. Molecular studies have revealed that RL9 encodes a GARP protein, an orthologue of Arabidopsis KANADIs. RL9 is mainly expressed in roots, leaves, and flowers. The transient expression of a RL9-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein has indicated that RL9 protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that RL9 acts as a putative transcription factor. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

57049179766	Badh2, encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, inhibits the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, a major component in rice fragrance	In rice (Oryza sativa), the presence of a dominant Badh2 allele encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) inhibits the synthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), a potent flavor component in rice fragrance. By contrast, its two recessive alleles, badh2-E2 and badh2-E7, induce 2AP formation. Badh2 was found to be transcribed in all tissues tested except for roots, and the transcript was detected at higher abundance in young, healthy leaves than in other tissues. Multiple Badh2 transcript lengths were detected, and the complete, full-length Badh2 transcript was much less abundant than partial Badh2 transcripts. 2AP levels were significantly reduced in cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-driven transgenic lines expressing the complete, but not the partial, Badh2 coding sequences. In accordance, the intact, full-length BADH2 protein (503 residues) appeared exclusively in nonfragrant transgenic lines and rice varieties. These results indicate that the full-length BADH2 protein encoded by Badh2 renders rice nonfragrant by inhibiting 2AP biosynthesis. The BADH2 enzyme was predicted to contain three domains: NAD binding, substrate binding, and oligomerization domains. BADH2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, where it is predicted to catalyze the oxidization of betaine aldehyde, 4-aminobutyraldehyde (AB-ald), and 3-aminopropionaldehyde. The presence of null badh2 alleles resulted in AB-ald accumulation and enhanced 2AP biosynthesis. In summary, these data support the hypothesis that BADH2 inhibits 2AP biosynthesis by exhausting AB-ald, a presumed 2AP precursor. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.

59749106750	Identification of a high frequency transposon induced by tissue culture, nDaiZ, a member of the hAT family in rice	Recent completion of rice genome sequencing has revealed that more than 40% of its genome consists of repetitive sequences, and most of them are related to inactive transposable elements. In the present study, a transposable element, nDaiZ0, which is induced by tissue culture with high frequency, was identified by sequence analysis of an allelic line of the golden hull and internode 2 (gh2) mutant, which was integrated into the forth exon of GH2. The 528-bp nDaiZ0 has 14-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and generates an 8-bp duplication of its target sites (TSD) during its mobilization. nDaiZs are non-autonomous transposons and have no coding capacity. Bioinformatics analysis and southern blot hybridization showed that at least 16 copies of nDaiZ elements exist in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare genome and 11 copies in the indica cultivar 93-11 genome. During tissue culture, only one copy, nDaiZ9, located on chromosome 5 in the genome of Nipponbare can be activated with its transposable frequency reaching 30%. However, nDaiZ9 was not present in the 93-11 genome. The larger elements, DaiZs, were further identified by database searching using nDaiZ0 as a query because they share similar TIRs and subterminal sequences. DaiZ can also generate an 8-bp TSD. DaiZ elements contain a conserved region with a high similarity to the hAT dimerization motif, suggesting that the nDaiZ-DaiZ transposon system probably belongs to the hAT superfamily of class II transposons. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that it is a new type of plant hAT-like transposon. Although nDaiZ is activated by tissue culture, the high transposable frequency indicates that it could become a useful gene tagging system for rice functional genomic studies. In addition, the mechanism of the high transposable ability of nDaiZ9 is discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

67649170943	Genetic features of a pollen-part mutation suggest an inhibitory role for the Antirrhinum pollen self-incompatibility determinant	Self-incompatibility (SI), an important barrier to inbreeding in flowering plants, is controlled in many species by a single polymorphic S-locus. In the Solanaceae, two tightly linked S-locus genes, S-RNase and SLF (S-locus F-box)/SFB (S-haplotype-specific F-box), control SI expression in pistil and pollen, respectively. The pollen S-determinant appears to function to inhibit all but self S-RNase in the Solanaceae, but its genetic function in the closely-related Plantaginaceae remains equivocal. We have employed transposon mutagenesis in a member of the Plantaginaceae (Antirrhinum) to generate a pollen-part SI-breakdown mutant Pma1 (Pollen-part mutation in Antirrhinum1).

67650321229	A new family of Ty1-copia-like retrotransposons originated in the tomato genome by a recent horizontal transfer event	Rider is a novel and recently active Ty1-copia-like retrotransposon isolated from the T3238fer mutant of tomato. Structurally, it is delimited by a duplication of target sites and contains two long terminal direct repeats and an internal open reading frame, which encodes a Ty1-copia-type polyprotein with characteristic protein domains required for retrotransposition. The family of Rider elements has an intermediate copy number and is scattered in the chromosomes of tomato. Rider family members in the tomato genome share high sequence similarity, but different structural groups were identified (full-size elements, deletion derivatives, and solo LTRs). Southern blot analysis in Solanaceae species showed that Rider was a Lycopersicon-specific element. Sequence analysis revealed that among other plants, two Arabidopsis elements (named as Rider-like 1 and Rider-like 2) are most similar to Rider in both the coding and noncoding regions. RT-PCR analysis indicates that Rider is constitutively expressed in tomato plants. The phylogeny-based parsimony analysis and the sequence substitution analyses of these data suggest that these Rider-like elements originated from a recent introgression of Rider into the tomato genome by horizontal transfer 1-6 million years ago. Considering its transcriptional activity and the recent insertion of the element into at least two genes, Rider is a recently active retrotransposon in the tomato genome.

68949166065	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice	MER3, a ZMM protein, is required for the formation of crossovers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis. Here, MER3, the first identified ZMM gene in a monocot, is characterized by map-based cloning in rice (Oryza sativa). The null mutation of MER3 results in complete sterility without any vegetative defects. Cytological analyses show that chiasma frequency is reduced dramatically in mer3 mutants and the remaining chiasmata distribute randomly among different pollen mother cells, implying possible coexistence of two kinds of crossover in rice. Immunocytological analyses reveal that MER3 only exists as foci in prophase I meiocytes. In addition, MER3 does not colocalize with PAIR2 at the beginning of prophase I, but locates on one end of PAIR2 fragments at later stages, whereas MER3 foci merely locate on one end of REC8 fragments when signals start to be seen in early prophase I. The normal loading of PAIR2 and REC8 in mer3 implies that their loading is independent of MER3. On the contrary, the absence of MER3 signal in pair2 mutants indicates that PAIR2 is essential for the loading and further function of MER3.

70350166691	Identification of a new rice blast resistance gene, Pid3, by genomewide comparison of paired nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat genes and their pseudogene alleles between the two sequenced rice genomes	Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases. The two major subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), indica and japonica, have shown obvious differences in rice blast resistance, but the genomic basis that underlies the difference is not clear. We performed a genomewide comparison of the major class of resistant gene family, the nucleotide-binding site-leucinerich repeat (NBS-LRR) gene family, between 93-11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica) with a focus on their pseudogene members. We found great differences in either constitution or distribution of pseudogenes between the two genomes. According to this comparison, we designed the PCR-based molecular markers specific to the Nipponbare NBS-LRR pseudogene alleles and used them as cosegregation markers for blast susceptibility in a segregation population from a cross between a rice blast-resistant indica variety and a susceptible japonica variety. Through this approach, we identified a new blast resistance gene, Pid3, in the indica variety, Digu. The allelic Pid3 loci in most of the tested japonica varieties were identified as pseudogenes due to a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2208 starting from the translation initiation site. However, this mutation was not found in any of the tested indica varieties, African cultivated rice varieties, or AA genome-containing wild rice species. These results suggest that the pseudogenization of Pid3 in japonica occurred after the divergence of indica and japonica. Copyright © 2009 by the Genetics Society of America.

0035026254	A tandemly repeated DNA sequence is associated with both knob-like heterochromatin and a highly decondensed structure in the meiotic pachytene chromosomes of rice	Highly repetitive tandem DNA sequence repeats are often associated with centromeric and telomeric regions of eukaryotic chromosomes. The rice tandem repeat Os48 is organized as long arrays of a 355 bp monomer and is mainly located in the telomeric regions. The chromosomal locations of the Os48 sequence were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on rice pachytene chromosomes. The majority of the Os48 loci are associated with brightly 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained and knob-like heterochromatin in rice pachytene chromosomes. As with other DNA sequences located in the heterochromatic regions, the cytosines of the CG and C(A/T)G sites within the Os48 repeat are heavily methylated. Surprisingly, a proportion of the FISH signals are highly decondensed and deviate significantly from the DAPI-stained periphery of the pachytene chromosomes. This highly decondensed chromatin structure has not been reported in pachytene chromosomes prepared from alcohol/acid-fixed meiotic samples in any other eukaryotic species. The condensation of the Os48 sequences is dynamic during prophase I of meiosis. The FISH signals derived from the Os48 repeat progress from a condensed configuration between leptonema and early pachynema into a decondensed structure from middle pachynema to diakinesis, and then return to a condensed form at metaphase I.

0035157212	Development and applications of a complete set of rice telotrisomics	We previously isolated a complete set of primary trisomics along with many other aneuploids from triploid plants derived from an indica rice variety "Zhongxian 3037." About 30,000 progeny from these trisomic and aneuploid plants were grown each year from 1994 to 1999. The variants that differed morphologically from both the diploids and the original primary trisomics were collected for cytological identification. From these variants, a complete set of telotrisomics covering all 24 rice chromosome arms was obtained. The identities of the extra chromosomes were further confirmed by dosage analysis of the RFLP markers on extra chromosome arms. The telocentric nature of the extra chromosomes in these stocks was verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a rice centromeric BAC clone as a marker probe. In general, the shorter the extra chromosome arm of a telotrisomic, the stronger the resemblance it bears to the diploid; the longer the extra chromosome arm, the stronger the resemblance to the corresponding primary trisomic. We demonstrated that DNA clones can be rapidly assigned to specific chromosome arms by dosage analysis with the telotrisomics. We also showed that telotrisomics are valuable tools for chromosome microdissection and for developing chromosome-specific DNA markers.

0035211340	Toward a cytological characterization of the rice genome	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) will be the first major crop, as well as the first monocot plant species, to be completely sequenced. Integration of DNA sequence-based maps with cytological maps will be essential to fully characterize the rice genome. We have isolated a set of 24 chromosomal arm-specific bacterial artificial chromosomes to facilitate rice chromosome identification. A standardized rice karyotype was constructed using meiotic pachytene chromosomes of O. sativa spp. japonica rice var. Nipponbare. This karyotype is anchored by centromere-specific and chromosomal arm-specific cytological landmarks and is fully integrated with the most saturated rice genetic linkage maps in which Nipponbare was used as one of the mapping parents. An ideogram depicting the distribution of heterochromatin in the rice genome was developed based on the patterns of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of the Nipponbare pachytene chromosomes. The majority of the heterochromatin is distributed in the pericentric regions with some rice chromosomes containing a significantly higher proportion of heterochromatin than other chromosomes. We showed that pachytene chromosome-based fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis is the most effective approach to integrate DNA sequences with euchromatic and heterochromatic features.

71649083943	Rice cellulose synthase-like D4 is essential for normal cell-wall biosynthesis and plant growth	Cellulose synthase-like (CSL) proteins of glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT2) are believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of cell-wall polymers. The CSL D sub-family (CSLD) is common to all plants, but the functions of CSLDs remain to be elucidated. We report here an in-depth characterization of a narrow leaf and dwarf1 (nd1) rice mutant that shows significant reduction in plant growth due to retarded cell division. Map-based cloning revealed that ND1 encodes OsCSLD4, one of five members of the CSLD sub-family in rice. OsCSLD4 is mainly expressed in tissues undergoing rapid growth. Expression of OsCSLD4 fluorescently tagged at the C-or N-terminus in rice protoplast cells or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves showed that the protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi vesicles. Golgi localization was verified using phenotype-rescued transgenic plants expressing OsCSLD4-GUS under the control of its own promoter. Two phenotype-altered tissues, culms and root tips, were used to investigate the specific wall defects. Immunological studies and monosaccharide compositional and glycosyl linkage analyses explored several wall compositional effects caused by disruption of OsCSLD4, including alterations in the structure of arabinoxylan and the content of cellulose and homogalacturonan, which are distinct in the monocot grass species Oryza sativa (rice). The inconsistent alterations in the two tissues and the observable structural defects in primary walls indicate that OsCSLD4 plays important roles in cell-wall formation and plant growth. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

71949115338	A lineage-specific centromere retrotransposon in Oryza brachyantha	Most eukaryotic centromeres contain large quantities of repetitive DNA, such as satellite repeats and retrotransposons. Unlike most transposons in plant genomes, the centromeric retrotransposon (CR) family is conserved over long evolutionary periods among a majority of the grass species. CR elements are highly concentrated in centromeres, and are likely to play a role in centromere function. In order to study centromere evolution in the Oryza (rice) genus, we sequenced the orthologous region to centromere 8 of Oryza sativa from a related species, Oryza brachyantha. We found that O. brachyantha does not have the canonical CRR (CR of rice) found in the centromeres of all other Oryza species. Instead, a new Ty3-gypsy (Metaviridae) retroelement (FRetro3) was found to colonize the centromeres of this species. This retroelement is found in high copy numbers in the O. brachyantha genome, but not in other Oryza genomes, and based on the dating of long terminal repeats (LTRs) of FRetro3 it was amplified in the genome in the last few million years. Interestingly, there is a high level of removal of FRetro3 based on solo-LTRs to full-length elements, and this rapid turnover may have played a role in the replacement of the canonical CRR with the new element by active deletion. Comparison with previously described ChIP cloning data revealed that FRetro3 is found in CENH3-associated chromatin sequences. Thus, within a single lineage of the Oryza genus, the canonical component of grass centromeres has been replaced with a new retrotransposon that has all the hallmarks of a centromeric retroelement. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

74949118825	Integration of cytological features with molecular and epigenetic properties of rice chromosome 4	It has been reported that rice chromosome 4 has eight major heterochromatic knobs within the heterochromatic half and that this organization correlates with chromosomal-level transcriptional activity. To better understand this chromosomal organization, we created a model based on the statistical distribution of various types of gene models to divide chromosome 4 into 17 euchromatic and heterochromatic regions that correspond with the cytological staining. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) experiments using a set of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones fromchromosome 4 placed all 18 clones in the region predicted by the model. Elevated levels of H3K4 di- and tri-methylation detected by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip were correlated with euchromatic regions whereas lower levels of these two modifications were detected in heterochromatic regions. Small RNAs were more abundant in the heterochromatic regions. To validate these findings, H3K4 trimethylation, H3K9 acetylation, H4K12 acetylation, and H3K9 di- and tri-methylation of 19 individual genes were measured by ChIP-PCR. Genes in heterochromatic regions had elevated H3K9 di- and tri-methylation while genes in euchromatic regions had elevated levels of the other three modifications. We also assayed cytosine methylation of these genes using the restriction enzymes McrBC, HapII, and Msp I. This analysis indicated that cytosines of transposable elements and some genes located in heterochromatic regions were methylated while cytosines of the other genes were unmethylated. These results suggest that local transcriptional activity may reflect the organization of the corresponding part of the chromosome. They also indicate that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in correlating chromosomal organization with transcriptional activity. © The Author 2008.

76749150501	DEP and AFO regulate reproductive habit in rice	Sexual reproduction is essential for the life cycle of most angiosperms. However, pseudovivipary is an important reproductive strategy in some grasses. In this mode of reproduction, asexual propagules are produced in place of sexual reproductive structures. However, the molecular mechanism of pseudovivipary still remains a mystery. In this work, we found three naturally occurring mutants in rice, namely, phoenix (pho), degenerative palea (dep), and abnormal floral organs (afo). Genetic analysis of them indicated that the stable pseudovivipary mutant pho was a double mutant containing both a Mendelian mutation in DEP and a non-Mendelian mutation in AFO. Further map-based cloning and microarray analysis revealed that dep mutant was caused by a genetic alteration in OsMADS15 while afo was caused by an epigenetic mutation in OsMADS1. Thus, OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 are both required to ensure sexual reproduction in rice and mutations of them lead to the switch of reproductive habit from sexual to asexual in rice. For the first time, our results reveal two regulators for sexual and asexual reproduction modes in flowering plants. In addition, our findings also make it possible to manipulate the reproductive strategy of plants, at least in rice. © 2010 Wang et al.

77649300194	ELE restrains empty glumes from developing into lemmas	Although there is evident homology among reproductive organs when comparing Poaceae (grass) and eudicots, the identity of grass specific organs, such as lodicules, palea, lemma, and glumes has been the subject of a vast and largely inconclusive discussion. Here we provide some direct evidence to support the idea that the empty glumes of rice (Oryza sativa) are counterparts of lemmas. We show that the development of empty glumes is regulated by ELE (elongated empty glume), which belongs to a plant specific novel gene family. Mutations at the ELE locus cause elongated empty glumes, which mimic the lemmas and have the epidermal morphology of lemmas with four or five vascular bundles. As a nuclear-localized gene, ELE is specifically expressed at the empty glumes of immature spikelets, and its ectopic expression causes many floral development defects, including lemma-like palea, extra palea-like structures, elongated lodicules, extra stamens and stigmas. Our result suggests that empty glumes are lemmas of the sterile florets located at the lateral side of the rice spikelet, and ELE acts as a regulator restraining its growth to maintain its small size in wild-type plants. © 2010 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

77749271398	ERECT PANICLE2 encodes a novel protein that regulates panicle erectness in Indica rice	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence (panicle) architecture is an important agronomic trait for rice breeding. A number of high-yielding japonica rice strains, characterized by an erect panicle (EP) of their architecture, have been released as commercial varieties in China. But no EP-type indica varieties are released so far. Here, we identified two allelic erect-panicle mutants in indica rice, erect panicle2-1 (ep2-1) and erect panicle2-2 (ep2-2), exhibiting the characteristic erect panicle phenotype. Both mutants were derived from spontaneous mutation. We cloned the EP2 gene by way of a map-based cloning strategy, and a transgenic complementation test rescued the phenotype of ep2-1. Anatomical investigations revealed that the ep2 mutants have more vascular bundles and a thicker stem than that of wild-type plants, explaining the panicle erectness phenotype in ep2 mutants. It was shown that EP2 was specifically expressed in the vascular bundles of internodes by GUS staining and RT-PCR. EP2 encodes a novel plantspecific protein, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum with unknown biochemical function. In addition, EP2 also regulates other panicle characteristics, such as panicle length and grain size, but grain number per panicle shows little change, indicating that the mutation of the ep2 gene could be applied in EP-type indica rice breeding.

77950363405	The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice	ZEP1, a transverse filament (TF) protein, is the rice (Oryza sativa) homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana ZYP1. In the Tos17- insertional zep1 mutants, homologous chromosomes align along the entire length of the chromosome, but the synapto- nemal complex is not assembled in early prophase I. Crossovers are well formed, and 12 bivalents could be detected from diakinesis to metaphase I, which leads to equal chromosomal segregation in anaphase I. Moreover, the number of crossovers has a tendency to be increased compared with that in the wild type. These phenomena are different from the TF mutants identified so far in other organisms. Chiasma terminalization of the bivalent, which occurs frequently in the wild type, seldom occurred in zep1. Transmission electron micrographs and immunodetection using an antibody against ZEP1 showed that ZEP1 is the central element of the synaptonemal complex. Although PAIR2 and MER3 were loaded normally in zep1, their dissociation was delayed severely compared with the wild type. In addition, ZEP1 is reloaded onto chromosomes in early microspores as the chromosome decondense, suggesting that ZEP1 might have other biological functions during this process. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.

78649329008	OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice	Spo11 is a homolog of a subunit of archaebacterial topoisomerase, which catalyzes DNA double-strand breaks and initiates homologous chromosome recombination. In the present study, we silenced the SPO11-1 gene in rice (Oryza sativa) using RNAi. Rice plants with loss-of-function of OsSPO11-1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed. Telomeres can be assembled as bouquet during the zygotene stage of the OsSPO11-1-deficient plants, just as that in wild type. Although the two axial-associated proteins, REC8 and PAIR2, are loaded onto the chromosomes, the depletion of PAIR2 from the chromosomes is much later than in wild type. The central element of the synaptonemal complex (SC), ZEP1, does not load onto the chromosomes normally, implying that SC formation is disturbed severely. The crossover protein, MER3, isn't efficiently assembled onto chromosomes and the lack of bivalent suggests that crossovers are also affected in the absence of OsSPO11-1. Thus, OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosomes pairing and crossover formation during meiosis in rice. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78651074717	PAIR3, an axis-associated protein, is essential for the recruitment of recombination elements onto meiotic chromosomes in rice	During meiosis, the paired homologous chromosomes are tightly held together by the synaptonemal complex (SC). This complex consists of two parallel axial/lateral elements (AEs/LEs) and one central element. Here, we observed that PAIR3 localized to the chromosome core during prophase I and associated with both unsynapsed AEs and synapsed LEs. Analyses of the severe pair3 mutant demonstrated that PAIR3 was essential for bouquet formation, homologous pairing and normal recombination, and SC assembly. In addition, we showed that although PAIR3 was not required for the initial recruitment of PAIR2, it was required for the proper association of PAIR2 with chromosomes. Dual immunostaining revealed that PAIR3 highly colocalized with REC8. Moreover, studies using a rec8 mutant indicated that PAIR3 localized to chromosomes in a REC8-dependent manner. © 2011 Wang et al.

79151479601	ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice	"zebra" mutants have alternating green and chlorotic crossbands on leaf blades and are widely distributed in monocotyledonous crops. Most recently, we cloned the first responsible gene from rice, ZEBRA2, which also leads to the phenotype of rice preharvest sprouting. ZEBRA2, a single-copy gene in the rice genome, encodes a carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of cis-lycopene to all-trans lycopene. ZEBRA2 shares high identity with known CRTISOs from other species. Expression analysis via both RT-PCR and ZEBRA2-promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice indicates that ZEBRA2 is predominantly expressed in mesophyll cells of mature leaves where active photosynthesis occurs. Consistent with the alteration in agronomic traits, the zebra2 mutant exhibits decreased photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content. Mutation of the ZEBRA2 gene results in the accumulation of all-trans-lycopene precursor, prolycopene (7Z,9Z,7′Z,9′Z tetra cis-lycopene), in dark-grown zebra2 tissues. Light-grown zebra2 mutant exhibits the characteristic "zebra" phenotype and decreased level of lutein, the xanthophyll that is essential for efficient chl triplet quenching. More severe phenotype of the zebra2 mutant under high light intensity indicates that "zebra" phenotype might be caused by photooxidative damages. We conclude that ZEBRA2 is involved in photoprotection in rice. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79952453679	Non-homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in haploid rice meiosis	While many studies have provided significant insight into homolog pairing during meiosis, information on non-homologous pairing is much less abundant. In the present study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate non-homologous pairing in haploid rice during meiosis. At pachytene, non-homologous chromosomes paired and formed synaptonemal complexes. FISH analysis data indicated that chromosome pairing could be grouped into three major types: (1) single chromosome paired fold-back as the univalent structure, (2) two non-homologous chromosomes paired as the bivalent structure, and (3) three or more non-homologous chromosomes paired as the multivalent structure. In the survey of 70 cells, 65 contained univalents, 45 contained bivalents, and 49 contained multivalent. Moreover, chromosomes 9 and 10 as well as chromosomes 11 and 12 formed non-homologous bivalents at a higher frequency than the other chromosomes. However, chiasma was always detected in the bivalent only between chromosomes 11 and 12 at diakinesis or metaphase I, indicating the pairing between these two chromosomes leads non-homologous recombination during meiosis. The synaptonemal complex formation between non-homologs was further proved by immunodetection of RCE8, PAIR2, and ZEP1. Especially, ZEP1 only loaded onto the paired chromosomes other than the un-paired chromosomes at pachytene in haploid. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79954425485	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	The events occurring at the onset of meiosis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, OsAM1 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by map-based cloning. OsAM1, a homolog of Arabidopsis SWI1 and maize AM1, encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain in its central region. In the Osam1 mutant, pollen mother cells are arrested at leptotene, showing that OsAM1 is required for the leptotene-zygotene transition. Immunocytological analysis revealed that OsAM1 exists as foci in early prophase I meiocytes. Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8. In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes. In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis. © 2011 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

0036112441	A fine physical map of the rice chromosome 4	As part of an international effort to completely sequence the rice genome, we have produced a fine bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map of the Oryza sativa japonica Nipponbare chromosome 4 through an integration of 114 sequenced BAC clones from a taxonomically related subspecies O. sativa indica Guangluai 4 and 182 RFLP and 407 expressed sequence tag (EST) markers with the fingerprinted data of the Nipponbare genome. The map consists of II contigs with a total length of 34.5 Mb covering 94% of the estimated chromosome size (36.8 Mb). BAC clones corresponding to telomeres, as well as to the centromere position, were determined by BAC-pachytene chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This gave rise to an estimated length ratio of 5.13 for the long arm and 2.9 for the short arm (on the basis of the physical map), which indicates that the short arm is a highly condensed one. The FISH analysis and physical mapping also showed that the short arm and the pericentromeric region of the long arm are rich in heterochromatin, which occupied 45% of the chromosome, indicating that this chromosome is likely very difficult to sequence. To our knowledge, this map provides the first example of a rapid and reliable physical mapping on the basis of the integration of the data from two taxonomically related subspecies.

79960074842	Osrec8 is essential for chromatid cohesion and metaphase i monopolar orientation in rice meiosis	The successful transmission of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis relies on the establishment and subsequent release of cohesion between replicated chromatids. Cohesion is mediated by a four-subunit structural maintenance of chromosome complex, called cohesins. REC8 is a key component of this meiotic cohesion complex in most model organisms studied to date. Here, we isolated and dissected the functions of OsREC8, a rice (Oryza sativa) REC8 homolog, using two null Osrec8 mutants. We showed that OsREC8 encodes a protein that localized to meiotic chromosomes from approximately meiotic interphase to metaphase I. Homologous pairing and telomere bouquet formation were abnormal in Osrec8 meiocytes. Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments on Osrec8 meiocytes demonstrated that the mutation eliminated meiotic centromeric cohesion completely during prophase I and also led to the bipolar orientation of the kinetochores during the first meiotic division and accordingly resulted in premature separation of sister chromatid during meiosis I. Immunolocalization analyses revealed that the loading of PAIR2, PAIR3, OsMER3, and ZEP1 all depended on OsREC8. By contrast, the presence of the OsREC8 signal in pair2, pair3, Osmer3, and zep1 mutants indicated that the loading of OsREC8 did not rely on these four proteins. These results suggest that OsREC8 has several essential roles in the meiotic processes. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.

79960074899	OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis	Shugoshin is a conserved protein in eukaryotes that protects the centromeric cohesin of sister chromatids from cleavage by separase during meiosis. In this study, we identify the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n = 2x = 24) homolog of ZmSGO1 in maize (Zea mays), named OsSGO1. During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase. In the Tos17-insertional Ossgo1-1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II. Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis. Furthermore, the timely assembly and maintenance of synaptonemal complexes during early prophase I are affected in Ossgo1 mutants. Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

80054709250	Characterization of CENH3 proteins and centromere-associated DNA sequences in diploid and allotetraploid Brassica species	CENH3 is a centromere-specific histone H3 variant and has been used as a marker to identify active centromeres and DNA sequences associated with functional centromere/kinetochore complexes. In this study, up to four distinct CENH3 (BrCENH3) cDNAs were identified in individuals of each of three diploid species of Brassica. Comparison of the BrCENH3 cDNAs implied three related gene families: BrCENH3-A in Brassica rapa (AA), BrCENH3-B in B. nigra (BB), and BrCENH3-C in B. oleracea (CC). Each family encoded a histone fold domain and N-terminal histone tails that vary in length in all three families. The BrCENH3-B cDNAs have a deletion of two exons relative to BrCENH3-A and BrCENH3-C, consistent with the more ancient divergence of the BB genome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunolabeling tests with anti-BrCENH3 antibodies indicated that both centromeric tandem repeats and the centromere-specific retrotransposons of Brassica are directly associated with BrCENH3 proteins. In three allotetraploid species, we find either co-transcription of the BrCENH3 genes of the ancestral diploid species or gene suppression of the BrCENH3 from one ancestor. Although B genome centromeres are occupied by BrCENH3-B in the ancestral species B. nigra, in allotetraploids both BrCENH3-A and BrCENH3-C proteins appear to assemble at these centromeres. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

80955166184	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	Panicle architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits that directly contribute to grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture. Morphological analyses reveal that panicles of two mutants produced more inflorescence branches, especially the primary branches, and contained more grains. Moreover, mutant plants also display more lodging resistance than the wild type. The grain yield per plant in mutants is also increased, suggesting that mutant plants have useful potential for high grain yield in rice breeding. Map-based cloning reveals that LARGER PANICLE (LP) encodes a Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein. RNA in situ hybridization studies display that LP expression was enriched in the branch primordial region. Subcellular localization analyses demonstrate that LP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, suggesting that LP might be involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Using yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, we confirm that LP is an F-box protein and could interact with rice SKP1-like protein in an F-box domain-dependent manner. Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues. These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants. © 2011 The Authors.

82255181320	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane	Cuticular wax forms a hydrophobic barrier on aerial plant organs; it plays an important role in protecting a plant from damage caused by many forms of environmental stress. In the present study, we characterized a rice leaf wax-deficient mutant osgl1-1 derived from a spontaneous mutation, which exhibited a wax-deficient and highly hydrophilic leaf phenotype. We cloned the OsGL1-1 gene by the map-based cloning method and performed a complementation test to confirm the function of the candidate gene. Molecular studies revealed that OsGL1-1 was a member of the OsGL1 family, and contained regions that were homologous to some regions in sterol desaturases and short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. Compared to the wild-type, the osgl1-1 mutant showed decreased cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticular membrane, decreased chlorophyll leaching, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced sensitivity to drought. OsGL1-1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice. The transient expression of OsGL1-1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein indicated that OsGL1-1 is localized in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and nucleus. © The Author 2011.

84859053740	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin	The switch from mitosis to meiosis is one of the most pivotal events in eukaryotes undergoing sexual reproduction. However, the mechanisms orchestrating meiosis initiation remain elusive, particularly in plants. Flowering plants are heterosporous, with male and female spore genesis adopting different developmental courses. We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, MICROSPORELESS1 (MIL1). The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility. Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that mil1 anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores. Furthermore, analysis of mil1 msp1 double mutants reveals that due to the absence of MIL1, the cells in their anther locule center do not activate meiotic cell cycle either, generating a similar anther phenotype to mil1. MIL1 encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin, which could interact with TGA transcription factors. These results suggest meiotic entry in microsporocytes is directed by an anther-specific mechanism, which requires MIL1 activity, and redox regulation might play important roles in this process. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84862001067	MRG-1 is required for genomic integrity in Caenorhabditis elegans germ cells	During meiotic cell division, proper chromosome synapsis and accurate repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are required to maintain genomic integrity, loss of which leads to apoptosis or meiotic defects. The mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosome synapsis, DSB repair and apoptosis are not fully understood. Here, we report that the chromodomain-containing protein MRG-1 is an important factor for genomic integrity in meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of mrg-1 function resulted in a significant increase in germ cell apoptosis that was partially inhibited by mutations affecting DNA damage checkpoint genes. Consistently, mrg-1 mutant germ lines exhibited SPO-11-generated DSBs and elevated exogenous DNA damage-induced chromosome fragmentation at diakinesis. In addition, the excessive apoptosis in mrg-1 mutants was partially suppressed by loss of the synapsis checkpoint gene pch-2, and a significant number of meiotic nuclei accumulated at the leptotene/zygotene stages with an elevated level of H3K9me2 on the chromatin, which was similarly observed in mutants deficient in the synaptonemal complex, suggesting that the proper progression of chromosome synapsis is likely impaired in the absence of mrg-1. Altogether, these findings suggest that MRG-1 is critical for genomic integrity by promoting meiotic DSB repair and synapsis progression in meiosis. © 2012 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

84862861419	A mutation in the rice chalcone isomerase gene causes the golden hull and internode 1 phenotype	The biosynthesis of flavonoids, important secondary plant metabolites, has been investigated extensively, but few mutants of genes in this pathway have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa). The rice gold hull and internode (gh) mutants exhibit a reddish-brown pigmentation in the hull and internode and their phenotype has long been used as a morphological marker trait for breeding and genetic study. Here, we characterized that the gh1 mutant was a mutant of the rice chalcone isomerase gene (OsCHI). The result showed that gh1 had a Dasheng retrotransposon inserted in the 5′ UTR of the OsCHI gene, which resulted in the complete loss of OsCHI expression. gh1 exhibited golden pigmentation in hulls and internodes once the panicles were exposed to light. The total flavonoid content in gh1 hulls was increased threefold compared to wild type. Consistent with the gh1 phenotype, OsCHI transcripts were expressed in most tissues of rice and most abundantly in internodes. It was also expressed at high levels in panicles before heading, distributed mainly in lemmas and paleae, but its expression decreased substantially after the panicles emerged from the sheath. OsCHI encodes a protein functionally and structurally conserved to chalcone isomerases in other species. Our findings demonstrated that the OsCHI gene was indispensable for flux of the flavonoid pathway in rice. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84862213492	Construction of rice mini-chromosomes by telomere-mediated chromosomal truncation	Telomere truncation has been shown to be an efficient technology for the creation of mini-chromosomes that can be used as artificial chromosome platforms for genetic engineering. Artificial chromosome-based genetic engineering is considered to be superior to the existing techniques of randomized gene integration by Agrobacterium or biolistic-mediated genetic transformation. It organizes multiple transgenes as a unique genetic linkage block for subsequent manipulations in breeding. Telomere truncation technology relies on three components: the telomere sequence that mediates chromosomal truncation, a selection marker that allows the selection of transgenic events, and a site-specific recombination system that can be used to accept future genes into the mini-chromosome by gene targeting. These elements are usually pre-assembled before transformation, a process that is both time and labor consuming. We found in this research that the three elements could be mixed to transform plant cells in a biolistic transformation, and produced efficient chromosomal truncations and mini-chromosomes in rice. This system will allow rapid construction of mini-chromosomes with a flexible selection of resistant markers, site-specific recombination systems and other desirable elements. In addition, a rice telotrisomic line was used as the starting material for chromosomal truncations. Mini-chromosomes from the truncations of both the telocentric chromosome and other chromosomes were recovered. The mini-chromosomes remained stable during 2 years of subculture. The construction of mini-chromosomes in rice, an economically important crop, will provide a platform for future artificial chromosome-based genetic engineering of rice for stacking multiple genes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84863693752	The tomato genome sequence provides insights into fleshy fruit evolution	Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a major crop plant and a model system for fruit development. Solanum is one of the largest angiosperm genera and includes annual and perennial plants from diverse habitats. Here we present a high-quality genome sequence of domesticated tomato, a draft sequence of its closest wild relative, Solanum pimpinellifolium, and compare them to each other and to the potato genome (Solanum tuberosum). The two tomato genomes show only 0.6% nucleotide divergence and signs of recent admixture, but show more than 8% divergence from potato, with nine large and several smaller inversions. In contrast to Arabidopsis, but similar to soybean, tomato and potato small RNAs map predominantly to gene-rich chromosomal regions, including gene promoters. The Solanum lineage has experienced two consecutive genome triplications: one that is ancient and shared with rosids, and a more recent one. These triplications set the stage for the neofunctionalization of genes controlling fruit characteristics, such as colour and fleshiness. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84863544776	A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows	The role of flavonoids as the major red, blue, purple and brown pigments in plants has gained these secondary products a great deal of attention over the years. In this study, we characterized a rice inhibitor for brown furrows1 (ibf1) mutant. In the ibf1 mutant, brown pigments specifically accumulate in hull furrows during seed maturation and reach a maximum level in dry seeds. Higher amounts of total flavonoids and anthocyanin in hull may be responsible for the brown pigmentation of ibf1. The IBF1 gene, which encodes a similar kelch repeat-containing F-box protein, was isolated by map-based cloning approach. Real-time RT-PCR and GUS activity assays revealed that IBF1 specifically expressed in reproductive tissues. GFP-IBF1 fusion protein mainly localized in cytoplasm. The expression of some major structural enzymatic genes involved in flavonoids biosynthesis could be up- or down-regulated to some different extent in ibf1 mutant. Our data suggested that IBF1 as a suppressor could inhibit the brown pigmentation of rice hull furrows. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84864589096	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis	In budding yeast, the ZMM complex is closely associated with class I crossovers and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. However, the relationship between the ZMM genes remains unclear in most higher eukaryotes. Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1. Our results show that in the rice zip4 mutant, the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced, although synapsis proceeds with only mild defects. Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes. Additionally, ZIP4 is essential for the loading of MER3 onto chromosomes, but not vice versa. Double-mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but their individual contributions are not completely identical in rice. Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants. These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1.© 2012.

0036939392	A genome-specific repetitive DNA sequence from Oryza eichingeri: Characterization, localization, and introgression to O. sativa	In the course of transferring the brown planthopper resistance from a diploid, CC-genome wild rice species, Oryza eichingeri (IRGC acc. 105159 and 105163), to the cultivated rice variety 02428, we have isolated many alien addition and introgression lines. The O. eichingeri chromatin in some of these lines has previously been identified using genomic in situ hybridization and molecular-marker analysis. Here we cloned a tandemly repetitive DNA sequence from O. eichingeri IRGC acc105163, and detected it in 25 introgression lines. This repetitive DNA sequence showed high specificity to the rice CC genome, but was absent from all the four tetraploid species with BBCC or CCDD genomes. The monomer in this repetitive DNA sequence is 325-366-bp long, with a copy number of about 5,000 per 1 C of the O. eichingeri genome, showing 88% homology to a repetitive DNA sequence isolated from Oryza officinalis (2n=2x=24, CC). Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed 11 signals distributed over eight O. eichingeri chromosomes, mostly in terminal or subterminal regions.

84866742138	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	COM1/SAE2 is a highly conserved gene from yeast to higher eukaryotes. Its orthologs, known to cooperate with the MRX complex (Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2), are required for meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends resection and specific mitotic DSB repair events. Here, the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n = 2x = 24) COM1/SAE2 homolog was identified through positional cloning, termed OsCOM1. Four independent mutants of OsCOM1 were isolated and characterized. In Oscom1 mutants, synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, homologous pairing and recombination were severely inhibited, whereas aberrant non-homologous chromosome entanglements occurred constantly. Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal. Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1

84866415999	MIL2 (microsporeless2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther	The formation of diverse, appropriately patterned cell types is critical in the development of all complex multicellular organisms. In flowering plants, anther patterning is a complex process essential for successful sexual reproduction. However, few genes regulating this process have been characterized to date. We report here that the gene MICROSPORELESS2 (MIL2) regulates early anther cell differentiation in rice (Oryza sativa). The anthers of mil2 mutants were characterized using molecular markers and cytological examination. The MIL2 gene was cloned and its expression pattern was analyzed through RNA in situ hybridization. The localization of the MIL2 protein was observed by immunostaining. MIL2 encodes the rice homolog of the Arabidopsis TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1) protein. However, mil2 anthers display phenotypes different from those of tpd1 mutants, with only two layers of anther wall cells formed. MIL2 has an expression pattern distinct from that of TPD1. Its transcripts and proteins predominate in inner parietal cells, but show little accumulation in reproductive cells. Our results demonstrate that MIL2 is responsible for the differentiation of primary parietal cells into secondary parietal cells in rice anthers, and suggest that rice and Arabidopsis anthers might share similar regulators in anther patterning, but divergent mechanisms are employed in these processes. © 2012 New Phytologist Trust.

84871777802	Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in SHOOT GRAVITROPISM, regulates plant architecture in rice	Tiller angle and leaf angle are two important components of rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture that play a crucial role in determining grain yield. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of the AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM5 (SGR5) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint. LPA1 was also found to affect shoot gravitropism. Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint. However, LPA1 only influences gravity perception or signal transduction in coleoptile gravitropism by regulating the sedimentation rate of amyloplasts, distinct from the actions of LAZY1. LPA1 encodes a plant-specific INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein and defines a novel subfamily of 28 INDETERMINATE DOMAIN proteins with several unique conserved features. LPA1 is localized in the nucleus and functions as an active transcriptional repressor, an activity mainly conferred by a conserved ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression-like motif. Further analysis suggests that LPA1 participates in a complicated transcriptional and protein interaction network and has evolved novel functions distinct from SGR5. This study not only facilitates the understanding of gravitropism mechanisms but also generates a useful genetic material for rice breeding. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84873051496	BRK1, a Bub1-related kinase, is essential for generating proper tension between homologous kinetochores at metaphase i of rice meiosis	Bub1 (for budding uninhibited by benzimidazole 1), one of the main spindle checkpoint kinases, acts as a kinetochore scaffold for assembling other checkpoint proteins. Here, we identify a plant Bub1-related kinase 1 (BRK1) in rice (Oryza sativa). The brk1 mutants are sterile due to the precocious separation of sister chromatids at the onset of anaphase I. The centromeric recruitment of SHUGOSHIN1 and phosphorylation of histone H2A at Thr-134 (H2A-pT134) depend on BRK1. Although the homologs can faithfully separate from each other at the end of meiosis I, the uncorrected merotelic attachment of paired sister kinetochores at the early stage of metaphase I in brk1 reduces the tension across homologous kinetochores, causes the metaphase I spindle to be aberrantly shaped, and subsequently affects the synchronicity of homolog separation at the onset of anaphase I. In addition, the phosphorylation of inner centromeric histone H3 at Ser-10 (H3-pS10) during diakinesis depends on BRK1. Therefore, we speculate that BRK1 may be required for normal localization of Aurora kinase before the onset of metaphase I, which is responsible for correcting the merotelic attachment. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84877978077	Functional analysis of Pid3-A4, an ortholog of rice blast resistance gene Pid3 revealed by allele mining in common wild rice	The rice blast resistance gene Pid3 encodes a nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) protein. This gene was cloned from the rice 'Digu' (indica) by performing a genome-wide comparison of the NBS-LRR gene family between two genome-sequenced varieties, '9311' (indica) and 'Nipponbare' (japonica). In this study, we performed functional analysis of Pid3-A4, an ortholog of Pid3 revealed by allele mining in the common wild rice A4 (Oryza rufipogon). The predicted protein encoded by Pid3-A4 shares 99.03% sequence identity with Pid3, with only nine amino-acid substitutions. In wild rice plants, Pid3-A4 is constitutively expressed, and its expression is not induced by Magnaporthe oryzae isolate Zhong-10-8-14 infection. Importantly, in transgenic plants, Pid3-A4, as compared with Pid3, displays a distinct resistance spectrum to a set of M. oryzae isolates, including those that prevail in the rice fields of Sichuan Province. Therefore, Pid3-A4 should be quite useful for the breeding of rice blast resistance, especially in southwestern China. © 2013 The American Phytopathological Society.

84878318744	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	MSH5, a meiosis-specific member of the MutS-homolog family, is required for normal level of recombination in budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis. Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis. Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility. The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous nondisjunction and complete sterile phenotype. OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I. OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10. However, those ZMM proteins cannot be localized normally in the absence of OsMSH5. Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5. Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation.© 2012 The Author.

84880831116	A novel translocation event leads to a recombinant stable chromosome with interrupted centromeric domains in rice	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) centromeres are composed of 155-bp satellite repeats (CentO), centromere-specific retrotransposon (CRR), and a variety of other repeats. Previous studies have shown that CentO and CRR elements are both parts of the functional centromere/kinetochore complex. In this study, a naturally occurring karyotype rearrangement involving a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 11 in an indica rice Zhongxian 3037 has been identified. The recombinant centromere in Chr11L·9L has two CentO tandem arrays, separated by a long array of 5S rDNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunostaining showed that centromere-specific histone H3 (cenH3) variant was bound to the two flanking CentO arrays, but not to the 5S rDNAs residing between the CentO repeats. No obvious difference was detected in H3K4me2 and H3K9ac modification of the 5S rDNAs between the wild type and the mutant. Therefore, the translocation results in a recombinant stable chromosome with interrupted centromeric domains. A lack of cenH3 binding in 5S rDNA sequences residing within the centromeric core suggests that not all centromeric sequences confer centromere identity in rice. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84884680679	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, Is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in RiceC	In meiosis, homologous recombination entails programmed DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly coupled with the DSB repair. Although SCs display extensive structural conservation among species, their components identified are poorly conserved at the sequence level. Here, we identified a novel SC component, designated CENTRAL REGION COMPONENT1 (CRC1), in rice (Oryza sativa). CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion. Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. CRC1 is orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae pachytene checkpoint2 (Pch2) and Mus musculus THYROID RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN13 (TRIP13) and may be a conserved SC component. Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation. CRC1 interacts with HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation. PAIR2, the rice ortholog of budding yeast homolog pairing1, is required for homologous chromosome pairing. We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes. The roles of CRC1 identified here have not been reported for Pch2 or TRIP13. © American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.

84885865393	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis	Mre11, a conserved protein found in organisms ranging from yeast to multicellular organisms, is required for normal meiotic recombination. Mre11 interacts with Rad50 and Nbs1/Xrs2 to form a complex (MRN/X) that participates in double-strand break (DSB) ends processing. In this study, we silenced the MRE11 gene in rice and detailed its function using molecular and cytological methods. The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed. Cytological analysis indicated that in the OsMRE11-deficient plants, homologous pairing was totally inhibited, and the chromosomes were completely entangled as a formation of multivalents at metaphase I, leading to the consequence of serious chromosome fragmentation during anaphase I. Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation. We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene. This protein showed normal localization in zep1, Oscom1 and Osmer3, as well as in OsSPO11-1

84886395963	Overexpression of microRNA319 impacts leaf morphogenesis and leads to enhanced cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativaL.)	MicroRNA319 (miR319) family is one of the conserved microRNA (miRNA) families among diverse plant species. It has been reported that miR319 regulates plant development in dicotyledons, but little is known at present about its functions in monocotyledons. In rice (Oryza sativaL.), the MIR319 gene family comprises two members, Osa-MIR319a and Osa-MIR319b. Here, we report an expression pattern analysis and a functional characterization of the two Osa-MIR319 genes in rice. We found that overexpressing Osa-MIR319a and Osa-MIR319b in rice both resulted in wider leaf blades. Leaves of osa-miR319 overexpression transgenic plants showed an increased number of longitudinal small veins, which probably accounted for the increased leaf blade width. In addition, we observed that overexpressing osa-miR319 led to enhanced cold tolerance (4°C) after chilling acclimation (12°C) in transgenic rice seedlings. Notably, under both 4 and 12°C low temperatures, Osa-MIR319a and Osa-MIR319b were down-regulated while the expression of miR319-targeted genes was induced. Furthermore, genetically down-regulating the expression of either of the two miR319-targeted genes, OsPCF5 and OsPCF8, in RNA interference (RNAi) plants also resulted in enhanced cold tolerance after chilling acclimation.

0040029703	An isotetrasomic of short arm of chromosome 10 in rice and its application to centromere mapping	The aneuploid with isochromosome or telochromosome is unique material for exploring the position of centromere in lingkage map. For obtaining the aneuploid in rice, the primary trisomic from triple-1 to triplo-12 and the aneuploid derived from a triploid of indica rice variety Zhongxian 3037 were carefully investigated from 1992 ∼ 1995. From the offsprings of triplo-10, a primary trisomic of chromosome 10 of this variety, an isotetrasomic triplo-10-1 was obtained. Cytological investigation revealed that a pair of extra isochromosomes of triplo-10-1 were derived from the short arm of chromosome 10. In the offspring of this isotetrasomic, a secondary trisomie triplo-10-2 in which the extra-chromosome was an isochromosome derived from the short arm of chromosome 10 was identified. With the isotetrasomic, secondary trisomic, primary trisomie and diploid of variety Zhongxian 3037, different molecular markers were used for exploring the position of centromere of chromosome 10. Based on the dosage effect revealed in the bands, it was verified that the molecular markers G1125, G333 and L169 are located in short arm, G1084 and other 16 molecular markers in long arm of chromosome 10. So the centromere of chromosome 10 is located between G1125 and G1084 consulting the RFLP linkage map given by Kurata et al

0345548556	Genomic characterization of Rim2 / Hipa elements reveals a CACTA-like transposon superfamily with unique features in the rice genome	The availability of huge amounts of rice genome sequence now permits large-scale analysis of the structure and molecular characteristics of the previously identified transposase-encoding Rim2 (also called Hipa) element, which is transcriptionally activated by infection with the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea and by treatment with the corresponding fungal elicitor. Based on genomic cloning and data mining from 230 Mb of rice genome sequence, 347 Rim2 elements, with an average size of 5.8 kb, were identified. This indicates that an estimated total of 600-700 Rim2 elements are present in the whole genome. Rim2 insertions occur non-randomly on the chromosomes, as visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The elements harbor 16-bp terminal inverted repeats with the core sequence CACTG, 16-bp sub-terminal repeats, internal variable regions, 3-bp target sequence duplications in the flanking regions, and genes coding for Rim2 proteins (the putative transposase) and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. High levels of insertion into genic regions are observed for members of this family, and the transposition history of the family can be deduced from the high level of shared sequences and analysis of repeat target sites of the elements. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the putative RIM2 proteins fall into a subgroup distinct from the TNP2-like subgroup of transposases. Southern hybridization with genomic DNA from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants demonstrates that the RIM2-coding sequence is unique to the Oryza genome. Our results demonstrate that the Rim2 elements from rice belong to a distinct superfamily of CACTA-like elements with evolutionary diversity.

84894634755	The rice semi-dwarf mutant sd37, caused by a mutation in CYP96B4, plays an important role in the fine-tuning of plant growth	Plant cytochrome P450 has diverse roles in developmental processes and in the response to environmental cues. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa L ssp. indica cultivar 3037) semi-dwarf mutant sd37, in which the gene CYP96B4 (Cytochrome P450 96B subfamily) was identified and confirmed as the target by map-based cloning and a complementation test. A point mutation in the SRS2 domain of CYP96B4 resulted in a threonine to lysine substitution in the sd37 mutant. Examination of the subcellular localization of the protein revealed that SD37 was ER-localized protein. And SD37 was predominantly expressed in the shoot apical meristem and developing leaf and root maturation zone but not in the root apical meristem. The sd37 leaves, panicles, and seeds were smaller than those of the wild type. Histological analysis further revealed that a decrease in cell number in the mutant, specifically in the shoots, was the main cause of the dwarf phenotype. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of several cell division-related genes was disturbed in the sd37 mutant. In addition, mutation or strongly overexpression of SD37 results in dwarf plants but moderate overexpression increases plant height. These data suggest that CYP96B4 may be an important regulator of plant growth that affects plant height in rice. © 2014 Zhang et al.

84896317708	Ten Years of Gene Discovery for Meiotic Event Control in Rice	Meiosis is the crucial process by which sexually propagating eukaryotes give rise to haploid gametes from diploid cells. Several key processes, like homologous chromosomes pairing, synapsis, recombination, and segregation, sequentially take place in meiosis. Although these widely conserved events are under both genetic and epigenetic control, the accurate details of molecular mechanisms are continuing to investigate. Rice is a good model organism for exploring the molecular mechanisms of meiosis in higher plants. So far, 28 rice meiotic genes have been characterized. In this review, we give an overview of the discovery of rice meiotic genes in the last ten years, with a particular focus on their functions in meiosis. © 2014.

84900989839	OsRAD51C is essential for double-strand break repair in rice meiosis	RAD51C is one of the RAD51 paralogs that plays an important role in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. Here, we identified and characterized OsRAD51C, the rice homolog of human RAD51C. The Osrad51c mutant plant is normal in vegetative growth but exhibits complete male and female sterility. Cytological investigation revealed that homologous pairing and synapsis were severely disrupted. Massive chromosome fragmentation occurred during metaphase I in Osrad51c meiocytes, and was fully suppressed by the CRC1 mutation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that OsRAD51C localized onto the chromosomes from leptotene to early pachytene during prophase I, and that normal loading of OsRAD51C was dependent on OsREC8, PAIR2, and PAIR3. Additionally, ZEP1 did not localize properly in Osrad51c, indicating that OsRAD51C is required for synaptonemal complex assembly. Our study also provided evidence in support of a functional divergence in RAD51C among organisms. © 2014 Tang, Miao, Li, Wang, Liu, Yu and Cheng.

84902543628	OsMYB103L, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, influences leaf rolling and mechanical strength in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Background: The shape of grass leaves possesses great value in both agronomy and developmental biology research. Leaf rolling is one of the important traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding. MYB transcription factors are one of the largest gene families and have important roles in plant development, metabolism and stress responses. However, little is known about their functions in rice.Results: In this study, we report the functional characterization of a rice gene, OsMYB103L, which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor. OsMYB103L was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity. Overexpression of OsMYB103L in rice resulted in a rolled leaf phenotype. Further analyses showed that expression levels of several cellulose synthase genes (CESAs) were significantly increased, as was the cellulose content in OsMYB103L overexpressing lines. Knockdown of OsMYB103L by RNA interference led to a decreased level of cellulose content and reduced mechanical strength in leaves. Meanwhile, the expression levels of several CESA genes were decreased in these knockdown lines.Conclusions: These findings suggest that OsMYB103L may target CESA genes for regulation of cellulose synthesis and could potentially be engineered for desirable leaf shape and mechanical strength in rice. © 2014 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84903445258	OsHUS1 Facilitates Accurate Meiotic Recombination in Rice	Meiotic recombination normally takes place between allelic sequences on homologs. This process can also occur between non-allelic homologous sequences. Such ectopic interaction events can lead to chromosome rearrangements and are normally avoided. However, much remains unknown about how these ectopic interaction events are sensed and eliminated. In this study, using a screen in rice, we characterized a homolog of HUS1 and explored its function in meiotic recombination. In Oshus1 mutants, in conjunction with nearly normal homologous pairing and synapsis, vigorous, aberrant ectopic interactions occurred between nonhomologous chromosomes, leading to multivalent formation and subsequent chromosome fragmentation. These ectopic interactions relied on programed meiotic double strand breaks and were formed in a manner independent of the OsMER3-mediated interference-sensitive crossover pathway. Although early homologous recombination events occurred normally, the number of interference-sensitive crossovers was reduced in the absence of OsHUS1. Together, our results indicate that OsHUS1 might be involved in regulating ectopic interactions during meiosis, probably by forming the canonical RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex. © 2014 Che et al.

84907150192	The map-based sequence of the rice genome	Rice, one of the world's most important food plants, has important syntenic relationships with the other cereal species and is a model plant for the grasses. Here we present a map-based, finished quality sequence that covers 95% of the 389Mb genome, including virtually all of the euchromatin and two complete centromeres. A total of 37,544 nontransposable- element-related protein-coding genes were identified, of which 71% had a putative homologue in Arabidopsis. In a reciprocal analysis, 90% of the Arabidopsis proteins had a putative homologue in the predicted rice proteome. Twenty-nine per cent of the 37,544 predicted genes appear in clustered gene families. The number and classes of transposable elements found in the rice genome are consistent with the expansion of syntenic regions in the maize and sorghum genomes. We find evidence for widespread and recurrent gene transfer from the organelles to the nuclear chromosomes. The map-based sequence has proven useful for the identification of genes underlying agronomic traits. The additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats identified in our study should accelerate improvements in rice production. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

84915764407	Crossover formation during rice meiosis relies on interaction of OsMSH4 and OsMSH5	MSH4 encodes a MutS protein that plays a specialized role in meiosis. In eukaryotic species, such as budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis, msh4 mutants display meiotic defects with a reduced number of chiasmata. Here, we characterized rice MSH4 by map-based cloning. In Osmsh4 mutants, the chiasma frequency was dramatically decreased to ~10% of the wild type, but the synaptonemal complex was normally installed. The double mutant analysis showed that in the Osmsh4 Osmsh5 mutant, the reduction of chiasmata was greater than other zmm mutants. This was consistent with the absence of localization for OsZIP4 and OsMER3 in Osmsh4 and suggests an earlier role for OsMSH4 and OsMSH5 than other ZMM proteins where they may be required to stabilize progenitor Holliday junctions. Using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, we verified the direct physical association between OsMSH4 and OsMSH5 and OsMSH5 and HEI10 in plants for the first time. The MSH4–MSH5 heterodimer has been demonstrated in mammals to stabilize the formation of progenitor and double Holliday junctions that may be resolved as crossovers (COs). We propose that OsMSH4 interacts with OsMSH5 to promote formation of the majority of COs in rice.

0842289255	Sequencing of a rice centromere uncovers active genes	Centromeres are the last frontiers of complex eukaryotic genomes, consisting of highly repetitive sequences that resist mapping, cloning and sequencing. The centromere of rice Chromosome 8 (Cen8) has an unusually low abundance of highly repetitive satellite DNA, which allowed us to determine its sequence. A region of ∼750 kb in Cen8 binds rice CENH3, the centromere-specific H3 histone. CENH3 binding is contained within a larger region that has abundant dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3-Lys9), consistent with Cen8 being embedded in heterochromatin. Fourteen predicted and at least four active genes are interspersed in Cen8, along with CENH3 binding sites. The retrotransposons located in and outside of the CENH3 binding domain have similar ages and structural dynamics. These results suggest that Cen8 may represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of centromeres from genic regions, as in human neocentromeres, to fully mature centromeres that accumulate megabases of homogeneous satellite arrays.

13744252991	Molecular cytogenetic characterization of the Antirrhinum majus genome	As a model system in classical plant genetics, the genus Antirrhinum has been well studied, especially in gametophytic self-incompatibility, flower development biology, and transposon-induced mutation. In contrast to the advances in genetic and molecular studies, little is known about Antirrhinum cytogenetics. In this study, we isolated two tandem repetitive sequences, CentA1 and CentA2, from the centromeric regions of Antirrhinum chromosomes. A standard karyotype has been established by anchoring these centromeric repeats on meiotic pachytene chromosome using FISH. An ideogram based on the DAPI-staining pattern of pachytene chromosomes was developed to depict the distribution of heterochromatin in the Antirrhinum majus genome. To integrate the genetic and chromosomal maps, we selected one or two molecular markers from each linkage group to screen an Antirrhinum transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) library. These genetically anchored TAC clones were labeled as FISH probes to hybridize to pachytene chromosomes of A. majus. As a result, the relationship between chromosomes and the linkage groups (LGs) in Antirrhinum has been established.
