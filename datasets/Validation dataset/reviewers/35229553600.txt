16644392878	Effect of parameters of cold sprayed Cu particles on its impacting behavior	The impacting behavior of Cu particle upon Cu substrate in cold spraying was studied using the finite element analysis, involving the effects of particle velocity and temperature prior to impact on the deformation behavior, temperature increment and contact area at the particle-substrate interface. It was found that with increasing the particle impact velocity the flattening ratio, temperature increment and contact area at the interface increase. It was confirmed that the critical velocity for the onset of shear instability of particle was consistent with that for particle deposition. As the particle velocity is higher than the critical one, the flattening ratio, temperature increment and contact area at the interface increase more significantly, which will benefit the formation of the bond between particle and substrate. With the increase of particle temperature the temperature at the interface increases significantly. The relatively high temperature achieved the melting point of particle material at the localized contact zone may promote the formation of the metallurgical bonding in the coating.

27744482924	Optimal design of a novel cold spray gun nozzle at a limited space	Numerical analysis for the accelerating behavior of spray particles in cold spraying is conducted using a computational fluid dynamics program, FLUENT. The optimal design of the spray gun nozzle is achieved based on simulation results to solve the problem of coating for the limited inner wall of a small cylinder or pipe. It is found that the nozzle expansion ratio, particle size, accelerating gas type, operating pressure, and temperature are main factors influencing the accelerating behavior of spray particles in a limited space. The experimental results using the designed short nozzle with a whole gun length of <70 mm confirmed the feasibility of optimal design for a spray gun nozzle used in a limited space. © ASM International.

33745059525	Examination of the critical velocity for deposition of particles in cold spraying	The critical velocity of copper (Cu) particles for deposition in cold spraying was estimated both experimentally and theoretically. An experimental method is proposed to measure the critical velocity based on the theoretical relationship between deposition efficiency and critical velocity at different spray angles. A numerical simulation of particle impact deformation is used to estimate the critical velocity. The theoretical estimation is based on the critical velocity corresponding to the particle velocity at which impact begins to cause adiabatic shear instability. The experimental deposition was conducted using Cu particles of different particle sizes, velocities, oxygen contents, and temperatures. The dependency of the critical velocity on particle temperature was examined. Results show that the critical velocity can be reasonably measured by the proposed test method, which detects the change of critical velocity with particle temperature and oxygen content. The Cu particles of oxygen content 0.01 wt.% yielded a critical velocity of about 327 m/s. Experiments show that the oxygen content of powder significantly influences the critical velocity. Variations in oxygen content can explain the large discrepancies in critical velocity that have been reported by different investigators. Critical velocity is also found to be influenced by particle temperature as well as types of materials. High particle temperature causes a decrease in critical velocity. This effect is attributed to the thermal softening at elevated temperatures. © ASM International.

33745067714	Effect of annealing treatment on the microstructure and properties of cold-sprayed Cu coating	Copper (Cu) coating was deposited by cold spraying, and the electrical resistivity of the coating in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the coating surface was measured to investigate the anisotropy of the coating. Annealing treatment was applied to the coating to examine its effect on the microstructure and properties of the cold-sprayed Cu coating. The examination of coating microstructure evidently revealed that the coating was constituted by the flattened particles, and the interfaces were clearly observed between the deposited particles. The anisotropy in microstructure and electrical resistivity was present in cold-sprayed Cu coating. The electrical resistivity of the as-sprayed coating was higher than that of Cu bulk. Moreover, the electrical resistivity along the direction parallel to the coating surface was lower than that along the perpendicular direction. It was found that annealing treatment led to the enhancement of particle interface bonding and evident recrystallization of the elongated grains and remarkable grain growth as well. The annealed coating presented equiaxed grain structures similar to the annealed Cu bulk with particle interfaces almost disappearing under certain annealing conditions The coalescence of voids or pores in the coating was clearly observed at high annealing temperatures. Moreover, the annealed coating yielded an electrical resistivity and microhardness comparable to Cu bulk. © ASM International.

It was found that the main factors influencing significantly particle velocity and temperature include the length and diameter of the barrel section, the nature of the accelerating gas and its pressure and temperature, and the particle size. Particles can achieve a relatively low velocity but a high temperature under the same gas pressure using a CB nozzle compared to a convergent-divergent (CD) nozzle.

33751434659	On high velocity impact of micro-sized metallic particles in cold spraying	In this study, a systematic examination of particle deformation behaviour in cold spraying was conducted for Cu particle using both the Lagrangian and Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) methods. It is found that the meshing size in modelling by Largrangian method influences significantly the localized shear instability at interface areas. With refining the meshing size the onset velocity for interface shear instability decreases. The extrapolation of these results yields a reasonable critical velocity comparable to the actual one in cold spray practice. The results indicate that both the flattening ratio and compression ratio of the deformed particles increase with the increase in particle velocity, which are in good agreement with the experiment results. The ALE method provides a suitable way to examine the particle deformation in cold spraying. Moreover, the numerical results also show that there exists the similarity for the deformation of particles of different diameters. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33846275856	Significant influences of metal reactivity and oxide films at particle surfaces on coating microstructure in cold spraying	Based on large amount of experimental observations, the effects of metal reactivity and oxide films at particle surfaces on coating deposition behavior in cold spraying were presented and discussed. The oxygen contents in as-sprayed Ti, Ti-6Al-4V and Al coatings were higher than those in the corresponding starting powders. The obvious flashing jets outside nozzle exit during deposition of Ti and Ti-6Al-4V were caused by the reaction of the particles with oxygen in the entrained or the adopted air. For Ti and Ti-6Al-4V coatings, their porous structures are predominantly attributed to the surface reactivity (defined as reactivity with oxygen). This surface reaction could be helpful for formation of a metallurgical bonding between the deposited particles. For Al, even though it is more reactive than Ti, the oxide films at Al particle surfaces suppress the surface activity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The acceleration behavior of Ti particle in cold spraying was investigated by numerical simulation. The microstructure and corrosion performance of cold sprayed Ti coating were examined. It is found that particle velocity increases when increasing both the accelerating gas pressure and temperature. The smaller particle yields a higher velocity. The experimental results show that a dense Ti coating could be formed with a porous surface layer. The as-sprayed Ti coating presents a more negative open circuit potential and larger corrosion current than that of TA2 (pure Ti metal) owing to its porous surface structure and high surface activity compared with TA2. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33847278971	Numerical simulation of deformation behavior of Al particles impacting on Al substrate and effect of surface oxide films on interfacial bonding in cold spraying	In this study, a comprehensive examination of the deformation behavior of Al particles impacting on Al substrate was conducted by using the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method to clarify the deposition characteristics of Al powder and the effect of surface oxide films in cold spraying. It was found that the deformation behavior of Al particles is different from that of Cu particles under the same impact conditions owing to its lower density and thus less kinetic energy upon impact. The results indicated that a higher velocity was required for Al particles to reach the same compression ratio as that of Cu particles. On the other hand, the numerical results showed that the oxide films at particle surfaces influenced the deformation and bonding condition between the particle and substrate. The inclusions of the crushed oxide films at the interfaces between the depostied particles inhibit the deformation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34247160852	Effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and microhardness of cold-sprayed tin bronze coating	Tin bronze (TB) powder was deposited on a stainless steel substrate by cold spraying. Post-deposition heat treatment was conducted in an electrical resistance furnace under nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 850 °C for 3 h. The effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and microhardness of cold-sprayed TB coating was investigated. It was found that the as-sprayed TB coating presented a dense microstructure. Heat treatment significantly influenced the microstructure and microhardness of cold-sprayed TB coating. A distinguishable diffusion layer of about 150 μm was formed in the coating near the coating/substrate interface. A compound was precipitated in the diffusion layer. The microhardness in the coating was changed gradually along the coating from the interface to the coating surface after heat treatment. The microhardness in the diffusion layer was high owing to the precipitation of hard phase, while it was much low in other area due to the obvious grain growth during annealing. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

34250356466	Ti and Ti-6Al-4V coatings by cold spraying and microstructure modification by heat treatment	The mictrostructure of cold sprayed Ti and Ti-6Al-4V coatings and the effect of heat treatment on coating microstructure modification was investigated. The results show that the cold sprayed Ti and Ti-6Al-4V coatings have porous structure with a high deposition efficiency. The porosities of cold sprayed Ti and Ti-6Al-4V coatings are found to be 5.4∓2.4% and 22.3∓4.7% under spray conditions. The results show that the reactions of spray particles with oxygen and the poor thermal conductivity of these materials result in a high particle interface temperature, resulting in localized melting and metallurgical bonding. Annealing at 859°C for 4 hours results in an increase in porosities of Ti and Ti-6Al-4V to coatings to 21.6∓4.6% and 29.7∓5.1% respectively, due to coalescence of incomplete interfaces and submicron pores.

It is found that the contact area between the deformed particle and substrate decreases and the crater depth in the substrate reduces with increasing the tilting angle at the same impact velocity.

35348894360	Study on impact fusion at particle interfaces and its effect on coating microstructure in cold spraying	This paper deals with the impact melting phenomenon at the interfaces between the deposited particles in cold-sprayed coatings and its effect on coating microstructure and particle bonding mechanism. Al-12Si, Al2319, Ti, Ti-6Al-4V, Ni and NiCoCrAlTaY powders were selected as feedstocks, which have various thermal and mechanical properties. The analytical results showed that most of the used materials possibly experienced the local melting at the contact interfaces of particles under certain impact conditions. Low melting point, relatively high gas temperature and chemical reaction with the atmosphere are the main factors contributing to the impact fusion during cold spraying. The results also indicated that the local melting would benefit the formation of a metallurgical bonding between the deposited particles and enhance the coating cohesion. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

35348964792	Effect of standoff distance on coating deposition characteristics in cold spraying	In this study, the effect of standoff distance on coating deposition characteristics in cold spraying in cold spraying was investigated by the experiment and numerical simulation of particle acceleration. Al, Ti and Cu powders of different sizes were used as feedstocks. It was found that the deposition efficiency was decreased with the increase of standoff distance from 10 mm to 110 mm for both Al and Ti powders used in this study. However, for Cu powders, the maximum deposition efficiency was obtained at the standoff distance of 30 mm, and then the deposition efficiency decreased with further increasing the standoff distance to 110 mm. The standoff distance had a little effect on coating microstructure and microhardness for these three powders. Both the stain-hardening effect of the deposited particles and the shot-peening effect of the rebounded particles take the roles in coating hardness. It was also found that the surface of substrate or previously deposited coating could be exposed to a relatively high gas temperature at a short standoff distance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

36248959292	Microstructure, microhardness and dry friction behavior of cold-sprayed tin bronze coatings	In this paper, two types of tin bronze coatings (Cu-6 wt.% Sn and Cu-8 wt.% Sn) were prepared by cold spray process. The as-sprayed coatings were subjected to a vacuum heat treatment at 600 °C for 3 h. The coating microstructure, microhardness and tribological performance were characterized. The effects of the tin content and the vacuum heat treatment on the microstructure, microhardness and tribological behavior of the coatings were investigated. It is found that the as-sprayed CuSn6 (As6) and CuSn8 (As8) coatings exhibit practically an identical porosity. Meanwhile, As8 presents a higher microhardness than As6. In addition, the increase of the tin content in the powder feedstock leads to a lower wear rate. After a heat treatment, coating porosities are significantly reduced. However, the coating hardness is significantly decreased and the coating presents a much decreased wear resistance. For the as-sprayed coatings, such factors as ploughing and particle delamination could determine the sliding process. The heat treatment results in a distinct modification of the tribological behavior. For the annealed coatings, the adhesion, between the coating and the counterpart, could play a dominant role in the sliding process. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

36249002798	Effect of friction time on flash shape and axial shortening of linear friction welded 45 steel	The influence of friction time on the flash (upset metal) shape and axial shortening during linear friction welding of 45 steel under an appropriate welding condition was examined. It was found that a sound weld with the fine structures could be formed as the friction time not less than 3 s. The axial shortening was exponentially increased with increasing the friction time. The periodical ridges presented in the flash were formed through the reciprocating motion and expelling of the plasticized materials. The flash in the friction direction presents an undulating-ribbon structure, while that in the vertical direction looks like a little curly swirl. The curved ridges were caused by the non-uniform extrusion rates of materials in the middle and edge resulting from the non-uniform temperatures. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Typical microstructure of the Ti-6Al-4V consisted of a bimodal structure in the form of elongated grains and intergranular mixture of lamellar grains. It was observed that a sound weld could be obtained under specific processing parameters. An obvious flash consisting of many small ridge was observed as a result of the oscillating extrusion process during LFW. A very thin weld of around 65-115 μm was formed with a superfine bimodal microstructure and much limited thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ), which is associated with the quick heating and cooling processes involved in LFW. It was also observed that the tensile properties of LFW processes Ti-6Al-4V alloy were comparable to or higher than those of the parent Ti-6Al-4V alloy because the fracture occurred in the parent material.

84861890827	Numerical study on the effect of substrate size on the supersonic jet flow and temperature distribution within the substrate in cold spraying	This study investigates the effect of substrate size on the supersonic jet flow regime, particle acceleration and temperature distribution within the substrate in cold spraying. A computational fluid dynamics approach is employed in the present work to achieve this objective. The simulated results show that substrate diameter has some effect on the gas flow regime and the consequent particle motion. When the substrate diameter is smaller than the nozzle exit diameter, the thickness of the bow shock formed in front of the substrate is rather small, which contributes to increase the particle impact velocity. With increasing the substrate diameter, the bow shock thickness increases gradually up to the point at which the substrate diameter is beyond the nozzle exit diameter. A further increase beyond this has almost no effect on the flow regime and the bow shock thickness. Besides, the current numerical work also reveals that the temperature distribution within the substrate can be significantly influenced by substrate thickness. With an increase in substrate thickness, the substrate temperature presents a downward trend, which means that higher inlet temperature may be required for thick substrate to achieve the same preheating effect. © ASM International.

The results show that two distinguishable regions exist in the deposited composite coating: the outer region and the inner region. The outer region presents a porous microstructure, while the inner region has a dense microstructure. The porosity of the coating becomes smaller with the increasing of the depth from the surface towards the boundary. The volume fraction of SiC particles in the deposited coating is 10% compared to that of 30% in the feedstock.

The average particle sizes of the used SiC feedstock varied from 66.94μm to 1.64μm. The calculated results by the FLUENT software show that the velocity of SiC particle decreases with the increase of the particle size, while the kinetic energy is greatly increased with increasing the particle size. The addition of SiC particles effectively reduces the porosity of the composite coatings. Furthermore, the porosity of the composite coatings increases with the decrease of SiC particle size, while the content of SiC in the coatings decreases with the decrease of SiC size. In addition, two effects of SiC particles determine the coating properties, i.e., the advantageous peening effect and the disadvantageous effect that reduces the effective contact between the coating and substrate.

Based on developed numerical simulation method, the non-vertical impacting behavior of copper particles colliding copper substrate in process of transforming material property was investigated. The join strength, penetration depth and condition of emerging adiabatic shear instability were discussed with single particle of uniform speed and different angles. It is revealed that the deposit effect of cold spray is deteriorating in certain angle collision comparing with the ideal vertical collision; with the increasing incidence angle, the penetration depth of particles is decreased and the join strength is weakened, even can't be embeded into the substrate and leads to the disengagement.

The microhardness of the composite deposited with the BM blend was three times higher than that of pure Al5356 coating. Compared to the coating deposited with the MM powder (MM composite), the hardness of the coating deposited with the BM powder (BM composite) was significantly increased owing to the increase of TiN volume fraction, which is comparable to that of the MM composite deposited with the 75 wt.% TiN feedstock. The adhesive strength of the composites was remarkably improved in comparison with the pure Al5356 coating because of the pinning effect of TiN particles. The coefficient of frication (COF) and wear rate (WR) were measured using a ball-on-disc tribometer. It was found that the COFs and WRs of the composites were much lower than those of pure Al5356 coating. Especially, the WRs of the MM and BM composites were, respectively, decreased by about 14 and 50 times than that of pure Al5356 deposit. This phenomenon could be ascribed that TiN particles contribute to a third-body abrasion in the following sliding process, which benefits the decrease of COF by rolling action partially instead of sliding action. For the BM composite, more and finer TiN particles present in the worn surface compared to the MM composite, which will be helpful to the further decrease of the COF and WR. © ASM International 2008.

57449084867	Effect of process conditions on microstructure and corrosion resistance of cold-sprayed Ti coatings	Ti and Ti alloys can be applied to steels as a protective coating in view of its excellent resistance to corrosive environment. Cold spraying, as a new coating technique, has potential advantages in fabrication of Ti coating in comparison with conventional thermal spraying techniques. In this study, Ti coatings were prepared on carbon steel substrates by cold spraying via controlling the process conditions. The microstructure of coatings was observed by SEM. The porosity of coatings was estimated by image analysis and the bond strength was tested for comparison of the process conditions. Potentiodynamic polarization and open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements were performed to understand the corrosion behavior of the coatings. The SEM examination shows that the coatings become more compact with the increases of pressure and temperature of driving gas. The otentiodynamic polarization curves indicate that the coating which has lower porosity has lower corrosion current. The polarization and OCP measurement reveal that cold-sprayed Ti coating can provide favorable protection to carbon steel substrate. The polishing treatment of coating surface polishes the rough outer layer including the small pores as well as decreases the actual surface area of the coating, leading to the considerable improvement of corrosion resistance. © ASM International 2008.

The microstructure, impact toughness and fracture characteristics of LFW Ti-6Al-4V joint were investigated. The results showed that a sound weld was obtained consisting of a superfine α + β microstructure in the weld center (about 70 μm thickness). The weld presents a higher impact toughness (61.3 ± 5.8 J/cm

67649413065	Characterizations of 21-4N to 4Cr9Si2 stainless steel dissimilar joint bonded by electric-resistance-heat-aided friction welding	A new welding process, electric-resistance-heat-aided friction welding (ERHAFW), was introduced in this study. To further improve the joint quality and energy-saving, electric resistance welding was combined with the conventional continuous-drive friction welding. 21-4N (austenitic stainless steel) and 4Cr9Si2 (martensitic stainless steel) valve steel rods of 4 mm diameter were used as base metals. The results show that electric-resistance-heat-aided friction welding can be applied to join thin rods within a relatively short time, which is very difficult for conventional friction welding (FW). The microstructure of ERHAFW bonded 21-4N to 4Cr9Si2 presents non-uniform across the joint. Different structure zones are observed from the weld line to both sides, which are the weld center, thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ). These regions exhibit different structures owing to the difference in the thermophysical and mechanical properties of these two steels under the fast heating and cooling during welding. The variation of microhardness in the joint is attributed to the microstructure change. The higher microhardness is obtained in the weld center and TMAZ of 4Cr9Si2 corresponding to the presence of fine tempered martensite and carbides. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was found that a thick and relatively porous Ti coating was deposited by cold spraying. The coating surface layer presented a more porous structure. The microhardness of the as-sprayed Ti coating was slightly higher compared to pure Ti bulk, owing to the work hardening effect during deposition. After annealing at 850°C for 4 h under vacuum condition, the Ti coating also presented a porous structure with more uniformly distributed small pores. A metallurgical bonding between the deposited particles was formed through annealing treatment. The adhesive strength of coating was significantly improved after annealing. The microhardness of the annealed Ti coating was also increased. © 2008 FSCT and OCCA.

In this study, the plunge stage of FSW tool was numerically examined by dynamic explicit finite element method with more attention to the temperature evolution. It was found that the high temperature region around the stirred zone extended with increasing the rotation speed. The heat affected zone expanded with the increase of inserting time, but the highest temperature around the stirred zone changed little. The range of the stirred zone changed little with the variations of the rotation speed and inserting time.

72049124814	Numerical simulation of linear friction welding of titanium alloy: Effects of processing parameters	Numerical modeling of linear friction welding (LFW) of TC4 titanium alloy was conducted using ABAQUS/Explicit with a 2D model. The coupled thermo-mechanical analysis was performed with the Johnson-Cook material model. The effects of processing parameters on the temperature evolution and axial shortening of LFW joints were numerically investigated. It is shown that the temperature at the interface can first increase quickly to about 1000 °C within 1 s, then increases slowly, and finally tends to become uniform across the interface under certain processing conditions. The temperature gradient across the joint from the interface is very high during the friction process. Consequently, significant axial shortening and fast formation of flash start to happen as the interface temperature becomes more uniform. During cooling, the interface temperature decreases steeply at a rate of several hundred degrees per second because of the fast heat conduction to the cold end of the specimen. The temperature distribution appears to be uniform in the joint after about 30 s. At a higher oscillation frequency, the interface temperature rises more quickly and the axial dimension shortens more and at a faster rate. The same phenomena are observed for the amplitude and friction pressure. The effects of these three factors can be integrated into one parameter of heat input. The axial shortening increases with increasing heat input almost linearly as the heat input exceeds a critical value. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The microstructure of the as-sprayed nanostructured Fe-Si was characterized by using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The grain sizes of the feedstock and as-sprayed deposit were estimated based on X-ray diffraction analysis. The microhardness and coercivity of the deposited Fe-Si alloy were characterized. The results showed that the as-sprayed deposit presented a dense microstructure. The mean grain size of the as-deposited Fe-Si was several tens nanometers and comparable to that of the corresponding milled feedstock. The temperature of driving gas presented little effect on the microstructure of cold-sprayed nanostructured Fe-Si deposit. The mechanical alloying induced oxygen contents up to 8 wt% in the feedstocks and subsequent deposits. The microhardness of the deposit reached about 400 Hv.

76449095432	Influence of spray materials and their surface oxidation on the critical velocity in cold spraying	The critical velocity is an important parameter in cold spraying, which determines the deposition efficiency under a given spray condition. The critical velocity depends not only on materials types, but also on particle temperature and oxidation conditions. In the present paper, three types of materials including copper, 316L stainless steel, Monel alloy were used to deposit coatings by cold spraying. The critical velocities of spray materials were determined using a novel measurement method. The oxygen content in the three powders was changed by isothermal oxidation at ambient atmosphere. The effect of oxygen content on the critical velocity was examined. It was found that the critical velocity in cold spray was significantly influenced by particle oxidation condition besides materials properties. The critical velocity of Cu particles changed from about 300 m/s to over 610 m/s with the change of oxygen content in powder. It is evident that the materials properties influence the critical velocity more remarkable at low oxygen content than at high oxygen content. The results suggest that with a severely oxidized powder the critical velocity tends to be dominated by oxide on the powder surface rather than materials properties. © 2009 ASM International.

A narrow, sound weld is formed, consisting of a superfine α+β structure in the weld center. The structure gradually changes from the weld center to the parent Ti17 in the TMAZ, with the highly deformed α and β phases oriented along the deformation direction, owing to the uneven deformation and temperature distribution. The microhardness of the TMAZ is the lowest of the distinct zones and presents a valley-like shape. The tensile strengths of the joints are comparable to that of the parent Ti17 but with a much lower plasticity and impact toughness. The microstructure variation contributes to the resultant properties. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

77649234765	Numerical investigations of the effect of oblique impact on particle deformation in cold spraying by the SPH method	In this study, a systematic examination of the oblique impacting of copper particles in cold spraying was conducted by using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method compared to the Lagrangian method. 3D models were employed owing to the asymmetric characteristic of the oblique impacting. It is found that in the oblique impact, the additional tangential component of particle velocity along the substrate surface could create a tensile force and decrease the total contact area and bonding strength between the particle and the substrate. The simulation results compare fairly well to the experiment results. Meanwhile, the asymmetric deformation can result in the focus of the shear friction on a small contact zone at one side, which may rise the interfacial temperature and thus facilitate the occurrence of the possible shear instability. Therefore, there probably exists an angle range, where the deposition efficiency may be promoted rather than the normal angle. Moreover, the particle deformation behavior simulated by the SPH method is well comparable to that simulated by the Lagrangian method and the experimental results, which indicates the applicability of the SPH method for simulating the impact process in cold spraying besides the previously used Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The characteristics of LFW joints of steel 45 with Chinese Standard (steel S45C), including temperature, stress, strain fields, axial shortening and the cooling process, were investigated. The results show that the interfacial temperature can increase to 800°C rapidly within 1s under a certain processing condition, and then increases to about 900°C slowly. With the progressing of welding, the temperature change of the welding joint gets uniform and becomes short to continuously contract in axial direction, the flash of the joint forms, and then the joint undergoes a rapid cooling process. The experimental results verify the reliability of the present model.

The dependency of deposition efficiency of cold spray Cu particles on the particle temperature and surface oxidation was examined. The effect of particle surface oxide scales on the interfacial microstructure and adhesive strength of the cold-sprayed Cu coatings was investigated. The results show that the deposition efficiency significantly increases with increasing the gas temperature but decreases with augmenting the oxygen content of the starting powder. The oxide inclusions at the interfaces between the deposited particles inhibit the effective bonding of fresh metals and remarkably lower the bond strength of the deposited Cu coatings on steel. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of post-spray heat treatment at 250 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C for 2. h on the microstructure and properties of CS Al5356/TiN composites was examined in this study. The results show that the heat treatment has little effect on the distribution of TiN particles in the matrix of all the composites. The pure Al5356 deposit presents large pores between the deposited particles after heat treatment, which is a common phenomenon for CS metallic coatings having an apparent increasing porosity during annealing. The adhesion between the deposit and substrate could be enhanced through atom diffusion, especially at elevated temperatures. However, the microhardness of all the deposits is significantly reduced after heat treatment because of the release of work-hardening effect within the as-sprayed metallic particles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that for the Lagrangian method, the meshing size and the element type significantly affect the resultant output. Moreover, the particle deformation behavior calculated by Eulerian method is more comparable to the experimental observation than that by Lagrangian method. Further study on the multi-particle impact process also demonstrates that Eulerian method is superior to Lagrangian method. In addition, the preliminary investigation on the mesh-free-based SPH method shows that this technique can provide a relatively reasonable result in the particle deformation behavior and the weight of the independent SPH particle exerts limited effects on the resultant output. Furthermore, owing to the meshfree feature and the appropriate solution to the contact interface, SPH method can also be employed to simulate the multi-particle impact process in cold spraying. © 2010 ASM International.

The influence of particle impact conditions on the interfacial microstructure evolution, microhardness and the bonding of particles in cold-sprayed Zn coatings are studied. An examination of coating surface morphology provides convincing evidence for melting at particle interfaces. The results reveal that the nanostructured phase was formed at the interface areas between deposited particles in coating resulting from the recrystallization of deformed grains. Melting at interfaces significantly enhances the bonding between the substrate and the coating and between the deposited Zn particles in the coating through the formation of a metallurgical bond. In addition, high driving gas temperature causes the decreasing hardness of deposited Zn coatings.

78650219114	Computational analysis of the effect of nozzle cross-section shape on gas flow and particle acceleration in cold spraying	In cold spraying, the spraying of certain complicated surfaces may require nozzles with special cross-sections. In this study, numerical investigation is conducted to study the effect of nozzle cross-section shape on gas flow and particle acceleration in cold spraying. The comprehensive comparison between rectangular nozzles and elliptical nozzles indicates that rectangular nozzles result in slightly lower mean particle impact velocity than elliptical nozzles. However, for rectangular nozzles, more particles may achieve relatively high velocity due to the larger sectional area of their potential core. Furthermore, it can also be found from the numerical results that the mean particle impact velocity increases gradually with the decrease in Width/Length ratio (W/L) of the cross-section because of the diminishing bow shock size. However, when reducing the W/L to 0.2, the mean particle impact velocity begins to decrease steeply, which may be attributed to the rather small area of the potential core for the case of W/L = 0.2. Moreover, the systematic study on the powder release position shows that releasing particles from the nozzle inlet can ensure that particles achieve a high impact velocity and temperature. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Some powder was annealed in a vacuum circumstance to avoid the effect of grain boundaries on the high velocity impact behavior of particles during cold spraying. The annealed Cu powder was deposited by cold spraying with respect to the single impacts and coating deposition under certain gas condition. In addition, the rebounded copper particles were collected for morphology analysis compared to the adhered particles. The results show that the average size of the rebounded particles is apparently increased compared with the starting powder because of the rebounding of larger particles and intensive plastic deformation of the rebounded particles. For the deposited particles, obvious plastic deformation causes a higher hardness to the coating. It is found that the rebounded particles have also experienced large deformation and shear instability at the impact interfaces. © 2010 ASM International.

It was found that the substrate angle has significant effect on particle impact velocity and normal velocity component. With increasing the substrate angle, the bow shock strength becomes increasingly weak, which results in a gradual rise in particle impact velocity. The distribution of the impact velocity presents a linearly increase along the substrate centerline due to the existence of the substrate angle and the growth rate rises gradually with increasing the substrate angle. Furthermore, the normal velocity component reduces steeply with the increase in substrate angle, which may result in a sharp decrease in deposition efficiency. In addition, the study on the influence of procedure parameters showed that gas pressure, temperature, type, and particle size also play an important role in particle acceleration. © 2010 ASM International.

The results show that the elastic modulus presents a W-shape distribution across the weld zone. The elastic modulus in the weld nugget zone is increased due to the grain refinement. In addition, the elastic modulus in the advancing side is slightly less than that in the retreating side possibly because of the relatively higher temperature in the advancing side during the welding process. The strength in the vicinity of weld center is decreased while the ductility is enhanced. The tensile strength and yield strength in the weld nugget zone and thermo-mechanically affected zone are significantly decreased while the elongation is increased due to the change of strengthening mechanism. In the heat affected zone the strength is decreased compared to the base material because the second phase grows up. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

The oxidation behavior at processing resulting in the oxide content inside sprayed coatings was investigated. Moreover, the powder passing through the HVOF flame was collected for the examination of the in-flight oxidation. The oxygen contents in coatings and collected powders were estimated by chemical analysis. It was found that the oxygen contents in the collected powders and coatings depended on the particle size. With decreasing in particle size, the oxygen content in the collected powders increased exponentially. The oxygen content inside the coating was approximately equal to that in the collected powders for the mean particle size of (>50 μm), For large particles (>50 μm),there was a clear difference in the oxygen contents inside the coating and in the collected powders. This difference can be attributed to the post-impact oxidation of a splat. The results suggested that there are two essential oxidation mechanisms: an in-flight oxidation and a post-impact one. When the small particles are used, the in-flight oxidation determines the oxygen content in the coating. When large particles are used, the post-impact oxidation controls the oxygen content in the coating. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

79959543814	Examination on substrate preheating process in cold gas dynamic spraying	Substrate preheating always takes an important role in particle bonding and formation of the first layer coating in cold gas dynamic spraying (CGDS). In this study, a systemic investigation on substrate preheating process is conducted with Cu, Al, Steel, and Ti substrate by both numerical and experimental methods. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach is adopted to simulate the heat exchange process between gas and solid substrate. The numerical results show that substrate can be significantly preheated by the higherature gas, especially by the gas at the near-wall zone behind the bow shock where the temperature is extremely high. Moreover, the comparison between different substrates implies that substrates with smaller thermal conductivity can achieve higher surface temperature and larger temperature gradient which may greatly contribute to the generation of residual stress, such as Ti substrate in this study. For the heat flux, Cu substrate obtains the largest value at the center zone of the substrate surface, followed by Al, Steel, and Ti substrate, but at the outer zone, the heat flux through the Cu substrate surface is smaller than the other three types of substrates. Besides, based on the experimental results, it is found that the substrate surface temperature amounts to the peak value only when the preheating time is sufficiently long. © 2011 ASM International.

Results show that the welding speed range for achieving a groove-free joint is enlarged with increasing the rotating speed.

However, few works about Mg coatings fabricated by cold spraying can be found in the literature. Thus, Mg coatings prepared at different main gas temperatures by cold spraying were investigated as well as their microstructure, phase structure, oxygen content and microhardness. The critical velocity of the particle was evaluated through numerical simulations. The particle deformation behavior and bonding mechanism were discussed. The result of the oxygen content measurement shows that the oxygen contents of coatings did not increase compared with that of the feedstock powder. The simulation results show that the critical velocity of Mg particles was in the range from 653 m/s to 677 m/s. The observation of the coating fracture morphology shows that the formation of the coating was due to the intensive plastic deformation and mechanical interlocking. The microhardness of the coating increased with the increase of the main gas temperature from 350 °C to 450 °C due to the decrease of the coating porosity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, numerical and experimental investigations on the heating behavior of the substrate and nozzle wall were conducted to clarify the temperature distribution within the solid bodies in CS. The results show that after heating by the hot gas, the highest temperature presents at the center point of the substrate and decreases toward the substrate back surface and edge. With increasing standoff distance or decreasing inlet temperature, the substrate temperature decreases gradually, but the temperature gradient within the substrate changes little. The numerical results are consistent with the experimental measurements. Besides, it is also found that increasing the substrate size (diameter) can lead to the gradual increment in the substrate temperature. Moreover, the numerical study on the temperature distribution within the nozzle wall reveals that the highest temperature presents at the throat section of the nozzle and that the nozzle material significantly affects the temperature distribution within the nozzle wall. © 2011 ASM International.

The joint microstructure, tensile strength and fracture characteristics were studied. Results show that the microstructure of parent metal has a strong influence on the microstructure and properties of LFW Ti-64 joints. Under the specific conditions in this study, unexpected spheric α grains were formed near the bondline, which leads to the steep drop of the joint tensile strength. Although the tensile strength could be improved through post-weld heat treatment, the failure of specimens still took place across the bondline with the cleavage fracture due to the formation of basket-weave structure at the weld center zone and the remaining of spheric α grains. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Results show that the temperature almost symmetrically distributes across the plate cross-section, and the temperature contour in the weld nugget zone presents a V type shape after the plunge stage. In the dwell stage, the frictional heat conducts around to preheat the plate. While in the moving stage, the heat gradually accumulates until a quasi-stable temperature field is formed. Moreover, it is shown that the heat conduction through the back plate has a significant effect on the temperature field.

84863243771	Numerical study on influence of axial pressure on inertia friction welding	A 2-D finite element model of inertia friction welding of GH4169 tubular was established based on the ABAQUS environment. The effect of axial pressure on the temperature field and axial upset of the joint was investigated by adopting the remeshing technique. The variations of joint temperature field under different axial pressures were also expounded. Moreover, according to the change of axial upset, the effect of axial pressure on the flash shape was analyzed. The results show that increasing axial pressure can significantly raise the conversion efficiency from flywheel kinetic energy to weld heat, shorten the time to high temperature quasi-steady state, and obtain flash shape. However, an extensively large pressure is negative to temperature field uniformity, which may result in bad stress concentration. At last, the pressure of 400 MPa is supposed to be a good parameter in this study.

84866035046	Deformation behavior of the oxide film on the surface of cold sprayed powder particle	In cold spraying, oxide-free interface is an important factor for metal-to-metal contact between powder particles and substrate, which determines the bonding strength and final coating quality. In this study, a systematic finite element analysis (FEA) is performed to examine the deformation behavior of the oxide film on an Al 6061-T6 particle surface after deposition. The simulation results show that the oxide film can be disrupted during the high velocity impact. Part of the cracked oxides remains at the interface and mainly accumulates at the central region after particle deposition. Substrate hardness, particle velocity and spray angle are found to influence the deformation behavior and final state of the oxide film. Besides, interparticle interaction is also investigated in the present work to clarify the deformation behavior of the oxide film inside the coating. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The data was recorded by a data acquisition card and processed by the LabVIEW software. By analyzing the evolution of frictional power, the joint formation mechanism was discussed.

0037461134	Deposition characteristics of titanium coating in cold spraying	Titanium coating was deposited by cold spraying process using nitrogen and helium gases under different temperatures and pressures. The deposition characteristics of the particle in cold spray were studied by the examination of the microstructure evolution of the deposited spot and coating. The effects of the gas type and temperature on the deposition behavior were examined. The microstructure was examined using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the pattern of a sprayed spot in cold spray presents a conical shape. The deposition efficiency of spray particles increases with the increase in gas temperature. Two distinguishable top and inner regions exist in the spot deposit and coating, which are characterized by the porous and dense microstructures. The dense microstructure results from the accumulative effect of tamping on the top porous region by the successive impact of following particles. The tamping effect has great influence on the microstructure of the coating in cold spray. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84869502395	Numerical analysis of joint temperature evolution during friction stir welding based on sticking contact	A three-dimensional numerical model for friction stir welding was developed by using the ABAQUS software based on a fully sticking friction. The temperature measurement was performed to validate the reliability of the model. The simulated thermal histories are in good agreement with the experiments. Simulated results show that the rotation speed has no influence on the time to reach the peak temperature in the workpiece, while the welding speed has significant effect on the time to reach the peak temperature at points away from the plunging center. The value of this peak temperature also changes somewhat. Moreover, the peak temperature in the workpiece tends to reach a quasi-steady state at the beginning of the moving stage; but the temperature at some distance away from the weld does not reach the quasi-steady state during the welding. © ASM International.

84869152715	Investigation on mechanical property of annealed copper particles and cold sprayed copper coating by a micro-indentation testing	In this study, the large annealed spherical copper powder (-120. +. 150. mesh) was cold sprayed on a copper substrate. Microstructures of the annealed Cu particles and cold sprayed Cu coating were characterized by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope, and the mechanical property of the Cu particles and the Cu coating were examined by a micro-indentation testing. The hardness and Young's moduli of the Cu particles and Cu coating were determined by the method of Oliver and Pharr under the different test forces. Results show that the annealed Cu particles present more homogeneous and lower mechanical property than that of the deformed zones of the cold sprayed Cu coating, and the large deformed zone has the different mechanical property from that of the small deformed zone of the cold sprayed Cu coating because of the strong work-hardening effect on the coating. In addition, the regular variation tendency of hardness and the irregular variation tendency of Young's moduli could be explained by the effect of indentation size effect and different degrees of deformation damage, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84873959683	Numerical simulation of friction welding processes based on ABAQUS environment	Friction welding (FW) is a collection of a series of friction-based solid state joining processes which can produce high quality welds of different components with either similar or dissimilar materials and has been attracting increasing attention. Due to the extreme condition encountered during FW and the highly thermomechanical coupled nature of FW, finite element methods have been widely developed to study the FW process. In the light of reasonable simplification, we developed several effective methods based on the ABAQUS environment. Initially 2D models were developed to investigate the complete FW process, where an implicit method with remeshing and map solution techniques and an explicit method with the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) adaptive mesh controls were proposed to effectively overcome the excessive element distortion by using the ABAQUS Standard and Explicit packages, respectively. In addition, a 3D model was also developed to obtain better simulation results with the help of the ALE adaptive mesh controls in the ABAQUS/Explicit package and the map solution technique in the ABAQUS/Standard package combined with the HYPERWORKS software. The experiments validate the feasibility and accuracy of the developed models. © 2012 Kavala Institute of Technology.

The LFW experiments and analytical heat loss analysis calculations validated this observation. Experiments show that the heat loss rate of the flash root is lower than that of the weld center during the cooling phase of LFW, which is observed in the model as well. Furthermore, analysis of the heat losses during the cooling phase of LFW shows that 90.7% of the flash heat is dissipated through conduction, pointing to the importance of flash heat reflux on the joint temperature. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the present study, the effect of particle and substrate preheating on the deformation behavior of cold sprayed particle was investigated using the Eulerian formulation available in software of ABAQUS/Explicit with typical copper material. Preheating ways were used by realizing different temperatures on the substrate, particle and both. Calculated results show that different preheating ways result in different deformation patterns, the flattening ratio and compression ratio of Cu particle and the maximum equivalent plastic strain.

The effect of particle size on the particle distribution is also studied. It is found that the particle distribution is mainly influenced by the turbulent kinetic energy of the carrier gas flow at the nozzle exit. Changing the height of the exit or throat can control the particle distribution. The height of powder injector only influences the particle velocity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Results show that the gas temperature improves the coating deposition efficiency, but has no effect on the volume fraction of SiC in the coatings and thus no influence on the coating microhardness.

84876321721	Effect of backplate diffusivity on microstructure and mechanical properties of friction stir welded joints	Series of welds were made by friction stir welding (FSW) with various backplates made out of materials ranging from low diffusivity granite to high diffusivity copper in order to reveal the effect of backplate diffusivity on the joint microstructure and properties. The temperature, microstructure, microhardness and tensile properties of joints were compared and discussed. Results show that the backplate with high diffusivity effectively decreases the heat input to the workpiece during FSW. With decreasing the backplate diffusivity the sizes of equiaxed recrystallized grains in the nugget zone increase obviously, while the hardness of the nugget zone also increases a little. The interface between the thermo-mechanically affected zone and nugget zone at the retreating side disappears under the granite backplate. Moreover, the ductility of the joint is more excellent under the copper backplate, but under the granite backplate the failure has mixed fracture characteristics of quasi-cleavage and dimples. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The inertia friction welding of high-temperature alloy was numerically simulated with ABAQUS finite element (FE) software, and the effects of welding parameters on the axial shortening were investigated. According to the simulated results, two models based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and radial basis function (RBF) neural network were developed to predict the axial shortening. By comparing two models, it is found that RBF neural network model showed a better agreement with the FE simulations than the SVM algorithm. Therefore, the RBF neural network could be helpful for FE modeling of inertia friction welding and reducing the time cost.

Results show that both the weld curvature radius and tool rotation direction have a significant influence on the microstructure of the curved joints during FSW. With decreasing weld curvature radius, the size of the tunnel defect is reduces and the proportion of fine Si particles in the stir zone increases. Si particles are finer and denser in the retreating side (RS) than that in the advancing side (AS) when both the welding direction and tool rotation direction are anticlockwise. However, when the welding direction is anticlockwise while the tool rotates clockwise, the proportions of fine Si particles decrease compared to the former situation. Furthermore, the tunnel defect is more likely to be present in the AS in the former situation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84882451225	Deposition behavior of thermally softened copper particles in cold spraying	Finite-element analysis (FEA) combined with experimental observation was conducted on preheated Cu particles deposited on Cu substrate to clarify the deposition behavior of thermally softened particles in cold spraying. An explicit FEA code, ABAQUS, was used to predict the deformation features of the thermally softened particles. The experiment was performed by a home-made cold-spray system with a powder preheating device. Considering the possible serious oxidation of the cold-sprayed particles under high-temperature conditions, the preheating temperature was limited to 300 °C for each test. Based on the numerical and experimental results, a new concept called the thermal softening zone within which thermal softening occurs is proposed in the present work. It is found that thermally softened particles deform more intensively compared to non-preheated particles, and a more prominent metal jet can be achieved at the rim of the deformed particles with higher initial temperature. Moreover, the results also reveal that increasing the particle preheating temperature can stimulate the occurrence of thermal softening. For non-preheating or low-temperature preheating particles, thermal softening mainly occurs at the interfacial region. If the preheating temperature is sufficiently high, the whole particle can experience thermal softening. In addition, it is also found that preheated particles are more likely to deposit on the substrate surface than non-preheated particles. In addition, particle preheating is also found to facilitate the coating formation process, enabling the coating to be very thick. The coating microhardness decreases with increasing particle preheating temperature due to the elimination of work hardening by thermal softening. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

84885646160	Impacting behavior of large oxidized copper particles in cold spraying	In a previous study, it has been experimentally demonstrated that surface oxide films of metallic particles have significant influence on the properties of cold-sprayed coatings. To clearly reveal the underlying mechanism, this study focused further on the effect of particle oxidation on the deposition behavior of oxidized Cu powder. Results show that the presence of the oxide films on the particles' surface can inhibit the plastic deformation of the particles. In addition, results concerning the morphologies and oxygen content of the rebounded particles show that the particles have experienced large plastic deformation that results in the break-up of the oxide films during the impacting process. Correspondingly, the hardness of the coating deposited with the oxidized powder is a little lower than that with the annealed powder because of the inferior plastic deformation and strain-hardening effect. © 2012 ASM International.

By tracing the bronze foil fragments in the weld after welding, the metal flow behavior during the welding process was revealed. Besides, the tool forces in the welding process were measured by the octagonal loop resistance turning dynamometer to expound the periodic variation of metal flow pattern. Results show that the flow behavior of the weld metal is different along the thickness direction. The flow pattern presents a periodic variation, and a formula has been proposed to calculate the periodicity of the metal flow. In addition, the weld nugget zone presents a "spoon" shape and the fine grains at the spoon handle and those at the spoon bowl are originated from different zones. A plastic metal flow model in FSW was proposed based on the results. Furthermore, the formation of defects was explained by researching the weld metal flow behavior. © 2013 Society for Experimental Mechanics.

Effects of SiC content in the coating on microstructure, mechanical property and wear behavior of the coatings were studied. Experimental results show that the SiC particles in the coating improve the deformation of Al5056 particles and also increase the hardness of the coating. The cohesion strength of the composite coatings firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of SiC content in the coatings as a result of comprehensive effects of the SiC particles on improving the deformation of Al5056 particles and on reducing the effective contact area between the Al5056 particles. Finally, tribological tests show that the SiC particle and its content in the coatings would greatly influence the tribological behavior of the coatings. The worn tracks suggest that the delaminating wear is the wear mechanism of the Al5056 and Al5056/SiC

84893687468	Numerical analysis of effect of backplate diffusivity on the transient temperature in friction stir welding	It is still not clearly known as to what extent the temperature field of friction stir welding joint is influenced by backplate diffusivity owing to the limitation of temperature measuring points. In the present study, therefore, the effect of backplate diffusivity on the temperature field of the workpiece was systematically investigated based on the numerical analysis. Simulated results show that the backplate diffusivity has a significant influence on not only the peak temperature but the final temperature distribution. More heat is dissipated by using a high thermal conductivity backplate during FSW. With increasing the backplate diffusivity, the peak temperature decreases gradually and the average cooling rate increases first and then slightly decreases. In addition, the time spent above 195 °C presents a nearly linear decrease with increasing the backplate diffusivity. Moreover, the width of temperature region higher than 195 °C in the transverse direction is remarkably diminished by using the backplate of a high conductivity, and changes little during the entire process. © ASM International.

Results show that the deformation behavior of the used materials could be classified as coordinated deformation (copper, iron, nickel) and uncoordinated deformation patterns (aluminum, stainless steel, and Inconel718). However, it was found that the steady maximum equivalent plastic strain values at the critical velocity for each material concentrate in the extent of 2.6-3.0 regardless of deformation pattern. Dimensionless analysis shows that, the calculated critical velocity increases with the increase of material characteristic velocity, and this relationship can be primarily used to predict the critical velocity. © 2013 ASM International.

Optic microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and microhardness tester were used to examine microstructures and microhardness of the prepared coatings. Dry sliding tribological tests of the coatings were conducted in an ambient atmosphere, and the wear mechanisms were discussed according to the worn traces investigation. The influences of an incorporation of particulate quasicrystalline phase on the microstructure and tribological behavior of reinforced composite coating were investigated. The results show that the composite coating prepared by cold spraying of mechanically blended powder presents a lower porosity and a higher microhardness as compared to the monolithic bronze coating. Hard quasicrystal particles exhibit a relatively lower deposition efficiencies, and the composite coating has a slightly lower coefficient of friction and a higher wear rate, as compared to the bronze coating. The abrasive wear is mainly responsible for the tribological behavior of the composite coating.

84902206983	Improving mechanical properties of pinless friction stir spot welded joints by eliminating hook defect	Hook defect (HD) seriously decreases the mechanical properties of friction stir spot welded (FSSW) joints. In this study, two methods were therefore used to eliminate the HD in pinless FSSW joints. The one is changing welding parameters such as rotating speed and dwell time. The other one is FSSW plus subsequent friction stir welding (FSSW-FSW), which is an innovative method proposed in this study. Experimental results showed that the HD in pinless FSSWed AA2024 joints was successfully eliminated by using FSSW-FSW, not by changing process parameters. The joints without HD exhibited a tensile-shear load of as much as 12. kN, which was higher than that of 6.9. kN in the joints with HD. Furthermore, it was proved that the tensile-shear load is not greatly improved only by increasing the nugget zone when HD still existed in the FSSW joints. In addition, the fracture morphology analysis demonstrated that the shear fracture of the FSSW-FSW joints took place along the boundary between the upper and lower sheets through the weld nugget, and the faying surface between the two sheets was completely sheared off. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84903549902	Strain-controlled fatigue properties of linear friction welded dissimilar joints between Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr-0.3Si alloys	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the microstructure, microhardness and fatigue properties of linear friction welded (LFWed) dissimilar joints between Ti-6Al-4V (TC4 according to Chinese classification) and Ti-6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr-0.3Si (TC11) titanium alloys. A significant microstructure change across the dissimilar joint occurs after linear friction welding (LFW), with martensite in the weld zone (WZ) and small recrystallized grains in the thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) on the TC4 side. A characteristic asymmetrical hardness profile across the dissimilar joint is observed with significantly higher hardness values in the WZ, and no soft zone is present in the dissimilar joint. The LFWed dissimilar joint exhibits essentially symmetrical hysteresis loops and an equivalent fatigue life to the base metals, which increases with decreasing strain amplitude. While cyclic stabilization appears at lower strain amplitudes up to 0.6% for the joint, cyclic softening basically occurs at higher strain amplitudes. In the joint fatigued at a high strain amplitude of 1.2%, a short initial cyclic hardening occurs, corresponding to the presence of twinning and the resistance to the dislocation movement. Fatigue failure of the dissimilar joint occurs on the TC4 side and is far from the weld line, suggesting that a highly durable and sound dissimilar joint is achieved via the present solid-state LFW. Fatigue crack initiation occurs from the specimen surface or near-surface defect, and crack propagation is mainly characterized by fatigue striations which are perpendicular to the crack propagation direction, in conjunction with some secondary cracks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84909641616	3D Finite Element Analysis of the Effect of Process Parameters on Linear Friction Welding of Mild Steel	In this work, a 3D numerical model was developed to investigate the complicated thermo-mechanically coupled process of linear friction welding (LFW). The explicit-implicit alternate method was adopted for the first time to simulate LFW mild steel based on the ABAQUS software. To cope with the excessive element distortion, remeshing was conducted at certain calculation time with the help of the HYPERWORKS software. Results show that the interface temperature is quickly increased to near 900 °C within 1 s. With increasing the welding time, the interface temperature reaches a quasi-steady state of about 950 °C and the axial shortening rate keeps almost constant. A final unilateral axial shortening of 2.73 mm was obtained under the experiment condition, which corresponds well to the experiment. Moreover, the effects of processing parameters (oscillation frequency, oscillation amplitude, and friction pressure) on the joint temperature evolution and axial shortening were systematically examined and discussed. These three parameters could be integrated into one factor, i.e., heat input to the interface.

The microstructure was analyzed and tensile property and microhardness of joints were examined.The results show that the joint could be divided into three zones: weld zone, thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and base metal. The weld zone presents typical fine grains, while the coarse and fine grains co-exist in the TMAZ. The tensile strength of joints is comparable to the base metal, but the ductility of joints is worse than that of the base metal. The microhardness presents a high-low-high tendency across the weld line with the lowest value in the middle of TMAZ. The mechanical properties of joints in different zones are associated with the content and distribution of strengthening phases and the lattice distortion in addition the grain size. Therefore, for LFW FGH96 superalloy, the optimization of process parameters and post-weld heat treatment are necessary to improve the joint properties.

84915783868	Pinless friction stir welding of AA2024-T3 joint and its failure modes	The joining of aluminum alloy sheets with thickness less than 2.0 mm is difficult via conventional friction stir welding owing to the defects in the joint, such as root flaw, keyhole and lazy S. In the present research, a newly designed pinless tool with involute grooves on its shoulder surface was applied to weld 1.5 mm thick AA2024-T3. The effects of the rotating speed and welding speed on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were analyzed.

The maximum tensile strength of the joints was 326 MPa, which is about 74.1% that of the base material. Moreover, all the tensile samples fractured from the retreating side. Two fracture modes were observed during the tensile tests, which are related with the lazy S.

84915822076	The effect of micro-swinging on joint formation in linear friction welding	A 3D Eulerian numerical model was developed to investigate the effect of micro-swing on joint formation during workpiece oscillation in linear friction welding (LFW). The temperature field and axial shortening history for different amplitudes of micro-swing have been studied. Results show that the amplitude of micro-swing influences flash morphology and axial shortening. The micro-swing contributes to the extrusion of viscoplastic metal and the formation of flash during the LFW process. Flash volume and axial shortening increase as the amplitude of micro-swing becomes larger. When the amplitude of micro-swing is more than a critical value, a sudden change of axial shortening (different from the period of the oscillation cycle) would occur at certain welding time, which change would also have a periodic nature. Although different amplitudes of micro-swing affect joint morphology, the inner temperature field and the highest temperature of joints remain constant. The high temperature region inside the joints remains about the same, when the amplitude of micro-swing is constant. This indicates that the heat generated through plastic deformation could maintain the welding process, and so that the welding process would enter the equilibrium phase.

84919430870	Effects of annealing on microstructure and properties of linear friction welded dissimilar titanium joints	Linear friction welds of Ti–6Al–4V (TC4, according to Chinese classification) to Ti–6·5Al–3·5Mo–1·5Zr–0·3Si (TC11, according to Chinese classification) were subject to post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) at 650°C×4 h (PWHT1) and at 950°C×1 h+530°C×4 h (PWHT2) under air cooling. In the as welded joint, TC4 had recrystallised sufficiently compared to TC11. After PWHT1, the α grains in the TC4 weld centre zone grew to some extent and many superfine equiaxed recrystallised α grains precipitated along β boundaries on the TC11 side. The grain growth along the weld line in the weld centre zone under PWHT2 was evident. PWHT2 reduced the joint tensile strength due to the coarsening of the microstructure. The joint microhardness decreased after PWHT.

11444252251	Microstructure evolution of cold-sprayed coating during deposition and through post-spraying heat treatment	The microstructural features of cold-sprayed coatings were investigated using Cu, Ti and Zn feedstocks by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to reveal the microstructure evolution mechanisms in cold spray. Four typical effects including tamping, refinement, impact-induced fusion and annealing were examined on microstructure. It is found that the microstructure of cold spray coating is remarkably influenced by spray materials. Ti coatings consist of evident porous layer and Cu coatings present a limited porous layer only near the surface. It is clear that the successive tamping effect and dynamic refinement of grains significantly influence the microstructure evolution of cold-sprayed coating. The tamping effect leads to the densification of porous coating layer gradually and the refinement effect leads to the formation of fine microstructure. It is considered that the large difference in the formation of porous layer is attributed to the dynamic impact pressure and hardenability of materials. It is also found that the impact-induced fusion during deposition of Zn coating can also modify the interfacial microstructure between particles in cold spray coating. Moreover, the nanocrystalline phase can be formed at the interfaces among particles resulting from the localized melting of the interfaces and tamping effect. Furthermore, the annealing treatment can modify the microstructure and property of a cold-sprayed coating.

11444253569	Optimization of spray conditions in cold spraying based on numerical analysis of particle velocity	The effects of the parameters involved in cold spray on the acceleration of particles are systematically investigated by a CFD code in order to reveal the main factors influencing significantly particle velocity. The parameters involved include nozzle geometry parameters, processing parameters and properties of spray particles. It is found that driving gas type, operating pressure and temperature are main processing parameters which influence particle velocity. As for nozzle geometry, the expansion ratio and divergent section length of spray gun nozzle show significant effects. Moreover, the density, size and morphology of powder also have significant effects on particle velocity. The effects of those main parameters are summarized in a comprehensive equation obtained through nonlinear regression of the simulated results for the estimation of particle velocity. The interactions of the parameters on particle acceleration can be examined through the equation. Moreover, the optimization of the dimensions of spray gun nozzle and spray parameters can be realized based on the obtained results.

11444254082	Formation of metastable phases in cold-sprayed soft metallic deposit	Zinc powder was used to deposit coating by cold spraying using nitrogen as driving gas. The microstructure of the deposited coating was characterized by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the cold-sprayed Zn coating presented a dense microstructure. The nanograins formed at the interface area between deposited particles, while the size of grains in the bulk inside of the particles in the coating was comparable to that in the starting powder. The interface region of the oriented lamellar microstructure was observed. The refinement of grains to the nanocrystallines at the particle-particle interfaces is achieved through the recrystallization of elongated grains resulting from intensive deformation. The lamellar microstructure is formed by the successive deformation of deposited fine particulates resulting from the jetting of impact-induced melt. An evolution model of the interface microstructure in cold spraying is proposed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
