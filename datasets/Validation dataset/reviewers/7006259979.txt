84928533501	Distributed source-relay selection scheme for vehicular relaying networks under eavesdropping attacks	The recent development of vehicular networking technologies brings the promise of improved driving safety and traffic efficiency. Cooperative communication is recognized as a low-complexity solution for enhancing both the reliability and the throughput of vehicular networks. However, due to the openness of wireless medium, the vehicular wireless communications (VWC) is also vulnerable to potential eavesdropping attacks. To tackle with this issue, we in this paper propose a novel user-cooperation scheme with anti-eavesdropping capabilities. Specifically, prior to any frame transmission, a source-relay pair is jointly selected to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. After that, the selected relay assists the source to deliver its data to the destination. The proposed selection scheme can be realized in a fully distributed manner, and the security is guaranteed without using any encryption techniques at the upper layers. The closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability and the intercept probability are derived, and the achievable diversity order is also analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the competing counterparts in terms of both the secrecy outage probability and the average secrecy rate.

84936079798	Energy cooperation for reciprocally-benefited spectrum access in cognitive radio networks	In this paper, we develop an energy cooperation scheme for secondary users' (SU) spectrum access in the hybrid energy supply primary system, which will improve both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. Specifically, the cooperation is implemented into two stages. In the first stage, the secondary system is allowed to access the licensed for secondary transmission. Simultaneously, the primary system harvests energy from the secondary radio-frequency signals. In the second stage, the primary system employs the energy from the energy harvester and the constant energy source for primary transmission in the remaining slot. Both the primary and secondary systems will benefit from our proposed energy cooperation scheme. The secondary system is allocated to access the spectrum freely and the primary system can harvest energy from SUs' radio-frequency signals. To analyze the throughput performance of both the primary and secondary systems, we derive the closed-form expressions of the outage probability and ergodic capacity for the delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes, respectively. Simulation results verify the analytical results and demonstrate that compared with direct transmission, the performance of the primary system in terms of throughput improves and the secondary system acquires more spectrum opportunities for the secondary transmission.

84946531212	Load-aware relay selection in lte - A system via global differentiated-fairness control	Relay selection is a crucial problem for LTE-advanced (LTE-A) networks in order to improve the performance of users in the cell-edge or the hot-spot areas. Relay selection needs to not only consider the distance, the channel quality or the differentiated throughput require of the network, but also take system traffic load into account. It is worth noting that the unbalanced traffic load often degrades throughput performance of the user under the backhaul resource constraint. To address this problem, we in this paper propose a scheme for joint relay selection and long-term resource allocation in interference-coordination enabled LTE-A networks. We show that the traffic load can be better balanced via controlling the global differentiated-fairness. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with conventional relay selection schemes, our proposed scheme can enhance the performance in terms of the global differentiated-fairness as well as throughput for hot-spot or cell-edge areas.

84946531504	On P2P-share oriented routing over interference-constrained D2D networks	Ubiquitous information exchange has motivated wide research interests on device-to-device (D2D) networks, where device nodes can communicate to each other reusing the cellular network's spectrum in an underlay fashion. We in this paper propose the peer-to-peer (P2P) share enabled routing schemes over multi-hop interference-constrained D2D networks, where multiple D2D subscribers attempt to download the common data from multiple distributed D2D servers. We aim at maximizing the average download rate over subscribers while keeping the interferences to cellular network's spectrum under a tolerable level. We focus on the scenario with two subscribers, two file servers, and two cellular users to avoid massive P2P share drastically increasing the interference temperature and crashing the network. Specifically, we develop a Routing scheme with Direct P2P-Share (R-DPS), which allows subscribers distribute their received data to each other. Moreover, we propose a Routing scheme with Coverage-based P2P-Share (R-CPS). The R-CPS scheme makes use of the broadcast nature of wireless channel to assure that each route can cover all subscribers, unlike passing through them in R-DPS scheme. The R-DPS and R-CPS schemes have the potential to enhance the data download rate compared with the approach without P2P support.

84946687679	Adaptive generalized space shift keying and downlink multi-user transmission in MIMO fading channels	To achieve spatial diversity and improve the average bit error probability (ABEP) of Generalized Space Shift Keying (GSSK) in Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels with low feedback overhead and computational complexity, we propose a three-step adaptive precoding strategy for single-user GSSK (SU-GSSK) transmission by exploiting the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). First, a norm based reference receive antenna selection is conducted to maximize the selection gain. Second, active transmit antennas are coherently superposed to boost the signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the reference receive antenna. Third, phase-rotation processing is introduced to maximize the Euclid distance of the spatial constellation diagram. By applying the above steps, better ABEP performance can be obtained compared to the baseline schemes, with remarkably reduced feedback and complexity. Moreover, combining with the proposed adaptive precoding strategy, we design a resource-saving method for multi-user (MU) data conveying by preprocessing and stacking all users' spatial constellations on increased number of active antennas and then implement a downlink MU-GSSK transmission scheme to provide several times the sum rate compared to SU-GSSK with acceptable ABEP performance. Complexity analysis and simulations show the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed schemes.

As a consequence, the joint estimation algorithm achieves better near-far resistance capacity and outperforms the conventional single-user detector.

20344379702	An improved adaptive MMSE algorithm for multirate multiuser detection in WCDMA systems	In this paper, we discuss multiuser detection based on wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) protocols. Multirate transmission and spreading method of WCDMA systems introduce a problem that characteristics of multiple access interference (MAI) change periodically. General adaptive algorithms will not work in that situation. An improved adaptive minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) multiuser detection algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. During our processing procedures, output vector sequence, which is cyclostationary, of matched filter is divided into several stationary vector sequences by down sampling. Then we respectively process those sequences using a bank of adaptive transversal filters using least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. The improved algorithm is analyzed under FDD mode of WCDMA protocols, in which S(2) short scrambling codes are applied. Simulation result shows that improved multiuser detection algorithm solves multirate problems well and effectively suppresses MAI under AWGN channels and multipath time-varying channels according to IMT-2000 Vehicular Model A. The improved adaptive MMSE algorithm has better performance than conventional detector and improved constant modulus algorithm using the same thinking.

34248144784	Antenna selection for V-BLAST systems in correlated channel	Spatial multiplexing systems can provide significant capacity improvement but are sensitive to channel correlation. Antenna selection is a low-cost low-complexity alternative to resolve these problems. This paper proposes a new transmit antenna selection algorithm for the spatial multiplexing systems with the vertical-bell labs layered space-time (V-BLAST) nonlinear receiver in correlated channel. The proposed scheme separates the optimization into two parts: it first chooses the optimal number of substreams in terms of the singular values of the channel matrix, then adapts the mapping of substreams to antennas according to the post-detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results illustrate that the proposed two-step selection criterion can provide greater selection gain than the existing singular value based selection criterion as SNR and scattering angle increase. The proposed criterion outperforms the existing one by 0.3 dB at a vector symbol error rate of 10

41049113998	Adaptive reduced-rank linear equalization of multiple input multiple output frequency selective channels based on multistage Wiener filter	Based on multistage Wiener filter, an reduced-rank adaptive equalizer for multiple input multiple output systems was proposed. The proposed algorithm uses the multistage Wiener filter to compute the base vectors of a subspace, and the output of the equalizer is then restricted in the lower-dimensional subspace by projecting input vectors into the subspace. Thus, the computational complexity is reduced and the convergence rate is increased. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the convergence rate of the proposed method is significantly faster and the computational complexity is much lower than existing adaptive algorithms. The proposed algorithm can achieve near full-rank mean square error performance with filter rank no more than 10.

84876666336	A DOF-based dynamic spectrum auction algorithm in cognitive femtocell	Dynamic spectrum auction (DSA) has been considered as one of potential spectrum allocation approaches in cognitive femtocell networks. As a modified version of traditional spectrum auction, DSA should not only increase auction revenue but also improve spectrum utilization on finer time granularity. We propose a DSA algorithm based on a double optimization framework (DOF), which focuses on the optimization of auction revenue and spectrum utilization. The optimization processing consists of two stages. Firstly, a proper auction period is selected to balance the expected spectrum utilization and auction revenue. Then, the cognitive femtocell base station adjusts its reserve price with the repetition of auction to leverage over instant revenue and spectrum utilization. At the same time, the bidders can adjust their bidding price to improve utilities. Performance analysis shows that the DOF-based DSA algorithm has low complexity and can resist collusion, so it can be carried out frequently with small overhead. On the other hand, it is better than the greedy algorithm and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction on revenue. Simulation results show that the DOF-based DSA algorithm can keep a fine spectrum utilization and bring the cognitive femtocell base station more revenue in both single-unit award spectrum auction and multi-unit awards spectrum auction.

84887998136	Joint packet scheduling and resource allocation with quality fairness for wireless VoD system	This paper investigates the problem of multiuser packet scheduling and resource allocation for video transmission over downlink OFDMA networks. A cross-layer approach is proposed to maximize the received video quality under the video quality fairness constraint. Unlike the previous methods in which the objective index is estimated the video quality in the unit of bit, the proposed algorithm develops the objective index in unit of packet, which is more fit for video transmission. In order to solve the optimization problem, a suboptimal algorithm of joint packet scheduling and resource allocation is proposed. The algorithm is compatible with the emerging wireless standards, such as IEEE 802.16.

58149112159	Packet level performance analysis in wireless user-relaying networks	In this paper, the impact of user relaying on the behavior of a relay node, which acts as the source node at the same time, is analyzed in a wireless relay network at the packet level. The analysis process models the behavior of the relay node as a queueing system and represents the service for its own packet transmission as an M/G/1-type Markov chain. By considering the fact that the maximum number of packet arrivals is ordinarily limited in a practical system, the M/G/1-type Markov chain is further reformatted into a quasi-birth-death (QBD) process through re-blocking so as to simplify the analysis and obtain the associated performance, such as average packet transmission delay. As an application of the results arising from the analysis, a new relay node selection scheme, based on a utility function approach that jointly considers the channel and the queue conditions at the relay node, is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed analysis model is quite accurate and the proposed relay node selection scheme is effective in balancing cooperative diversity gain and packet transmission delay. © 2006 IEEE.

79954605035	A channel assignment algorithm via conflict shifting for distributed cognitive networks	Channel assignment is a challenge for distributed cognitive networks due to spectrum mobility and lack of centralized entity. We present a dynamic and efficient algorithm via conflict shifting, referred as Shifting-based Channel Assignment (SCA). In this algorithm, the system was modeled with a conflict graph, and users cannot assign the channels that primary users (legacy users) and neighbors already occupied. In order to eliminate the conflicts between neighbors efficiently, secondary users (unlicensed users) try to transfer them through a straight path to the boundary, where conflicts are easier to solve as there are less neighbors for boundary users. Actions in one shift are executed in slots, and users act in a synchronous and separated manner. As a result, some of the conflicting channels are avoid from directly abandoned, and for this, utility of the entire network can be improved. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide similar utility performance while obviously reducing the communication cost than bargaining-base algorithms. In small scale networks with low user mobility (under 20%), it reduces 50% of the communication overhead than the later. © 2010 Science Press, Institute of Electronics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Then, because of high complexity of the optimal power allocation algorithm, we propose an effective suboptimal power loading scheme. Theory analysis and simulation results show that the performance of the suboptimal power allocation algorithm is close to the performance of the optimal power allocation algorithm, while the complexity of the suboptimal power allocation algorithm is much lower. © 2010 Science Press, Institute of Electronics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79955614877	Polarization-based long-range communication directional MAC protocol for Cognitive Ad Hoc Networks	Utilizing available channels to improve the network performance is one of the most important targets for the cognitive MAC protocol design. Using antenna technologies is an efficient way to reach this target. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel cognitive MAC protocol, called Polarization-based Long-range Communication Directional MAC Protocol (PLRC-DMAC), for Cognitive Ad Hoc Networks (CAHNs). The proposed protocol uses directional antennas to acquire better spatial reuse and establish long-range communication links, which can support more nodes to access the same channel simultaneously. Moreover, the PLRCDMAC also uses polarization diversity to allow nodes in the CAHN to share the same channel with Primary Users (PUs). Furthermore, we also propose a Long-range Orientation (LRO) algorithm to orient the long-range nodes. Simulation results show that the LRO algorithm can accurately orient the long-range nodes, and the PLRC-DMAC can significantly increase the network throughput as well as reduce the end-to-end delay.

79955622253	A multiple antenna spectrum sensing scheme based on space and time diversity in cognitive radios	Multiple antenna is introduced into spectrum sensing in cognitive radios recently. However, conventional multiple antenna spectrum sensing schemes exploited only space diversity. In this paper, we propose a new multiple antenna sensing scheme based on space and time diversity (MASS-BSTD). First, the primary user signal to be sensed is oversampled at each antenna, and signal samples collected at the same time instant from different antennas are stacked into a column vector. Second, each column vector is utilized to estimate space correlation matrix that exploits space diversity, and two consecutive column vectors are utilized to estimate time correlation matrix that exploits time diversity. Third, the estimated space correlation matrix and time correlation matrix are combined and analyzed using eigenvalue decomposition to reduce information redundancy of signals from multiple antennas. Lastly, the derived eigenvalues are utilized to construct the test statistic and sense the presence of the primary user signal. Since the proposed MASS-BSTD exploits both space diversity and time diversity, it achieves performance gain over the counterparts that only exploit space diversity. Furthermore, the proposed MASS-BSTD requires no prior information on the primary user, the channel between primary user transmitter and secondary user receiver, and is robust to noise uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed MASS-BSTD can sense the presence of primary user signal reliably.

In each slot, the source and destination choose a set of channels to sense and then decide the transmission channels based on the sensing results. In order to maximize the throughput for each link, we use the theories of sequential decision and optimal stopping to determine the optimal sensing channel set. Moreover, we also establish the myopic policy and exploit the monotonicity of the reward function that we use, which can be used to reduce the complexity of the sequential decision.

79957968111	A high-linearity 264-MHz source-follower-based low-pass filter with high-Q second-order cell for MB-OFDM UWB	Source-follower-based (SFB) continuous-time low-pass filters (LPF) have the advantages of low power and high linearity over other filter topologies. The second-order SFB filter cells, which are key building blocks for high-order SFB filters, are often realized by composite source follower with positive feedback. For a single branch 2nd-order SFB cell, the linearity drops severely at high frequencies in the pass band because its slew-rate is restricted by the Q factor and the pole frequency. The folded 2nd-order SFB cell provides higher linearity because it has two DC branches, and hence has another freedom to increase the slew rate. However, because of the positive feedback, the folded and unfolded 2nd-order SFB cells, especially those with high Q factors, tend to be unstable and act as relaxation oscillators under given circuit parameters. In order to obtain higher Q factor, a new topology for the 2nd-order SFB cell without positive feedback is proposed in this paper, which is unconditionally stable and can provide high linearity. Based on the folded 2nd-order SFB cell and the proposed high-Q SFB cell, a 264MHz sixth-order LPF with 3 stages for ultra wideband (UWB) applications is designed in 0.18 μm CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the LPF achieves an IIP3 of above 12.5 dBm in the whole pass band. The LPF consumes only 4.1mA from a 1.8V power supply, and has a layout area of 200 μm × 150 μm.

80155206774	Dynamic spectrum allocation based on MEG algorithm	Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) based on secondary spectrum market is considered a promising technology to improve spectrum utilization efficiency and to relieve the wireless spectrum shortage problem. We propose a dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm named market equilibrium and game (MEG), and construct a complete secondary spectrum market. The market based on the MEG algorithm consists of two submarkets: multiple primary services providers (PSPs) and a dynamic spectrum allocation server (DSAS) form the high submarket, while the low submarket is composed of the DSAS and a number of secondary users. In the low submarket, the MEG algorithm provides a game type selection strategy. By this strategy, the DSAS can win more payoffs with lower unit spectrum price, which encourages secondary users to use more spectrum. A secondary user can also choose its preferable game type between dynamic game and Nash bargaining flexibly. On the other hand, a bargaining procedure in the high submarket is designed in the MEG algorithm to ensure that market equilibrium is quickly reached. A performance analysis shows that the strategy of game type selection is fair and feasible for both the DSAS and the secondary users. Moreover, the bargaining procedure is better than the existing algorithm which adjusts price step by step in the high submarket. Simulation results also demonstrate that the market fluctuation in the low submarket is passed to the high submarket by way of the DSAS. The MEG algorithm can effectively satisfy the highly-fluctuating demands from the secondary users. In addition, the MEG algorithm can improve the payoffs of all players and increase spectrum utilization efficiency.

84155187220	Primary-user behavior based joint routing and channel allocation algorithm in cognitive radio networks	To resolve the unstable routing problem due to the variation of spectrum availability caused by primary users' behaviors in cognitive radio networks (CRN), a primary-user behavior based joint routing and channel allocation (PUB-JRCA) algorithm was proposed. The PUC-JRCA algorithm characterized the primary-user behavior by using the call-based model. According to the route discovery mechanism in the dynamic source routing protocol, the destination node selected the route which received the least impact from primary-user behaviors after receiving a number of route requests. Then, the destination sent back the route reply packet (RREP) along the selected route, and the channel allocation was performed when the RREP passed each node on this route. Theoretic analyses prove that the expected available transmission time for the packet delivery is inversely proportional to the probability that PU is active. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is proportional to the number of nodes in the CRN. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has higher packet delivery ratio and lower average packet delay than the Gymkhana routing scheme.

84858281962	A directional MAC protocol with long-range communication ability in ad hoc networks	To address the problem that long-range communication capability in ad hoc networks using directional antenna is not generally utilized, a directional media access control (DMAC) protocol with long-range communication (LRC) capability in ad hoc networks is proposed. In the LRC-DMAC, the intermediate node uses a long-range orientation (LRO) algorithm to help the transmitter obtain the directional information of the receiver which is two hops away. Consequently, the long-range link between such two hops nodes can be set up. According to whether the received power information is available or not, we propose two types of LRO algorithm: without the received power information, a basic LRO obtains the approximate directional information of the long-range receiver by a geometric relationship; however, the LRO-PI can calculate the accurate directional information of the long-range receiver using the received power. Performance analysis indicates that the LRO algorithm achieves high accuracy when the relevant parameters are properly chosen. Simulation results show that the establishment of long-range links can effectively improve the network throughput and reduce the end-to-end delay. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84862680683	A joint routing and time-slot assignment algorithm for multi-hop cognitive radio networks with primary-user protection	Cognitive radio has recently emerged as a promising technology to improve the utilization efficiency of the radio spectrum. In cognitive radio networks, secondary users (SUs) must avoid causing any harmful interference to primary users (PUs) and transparently utilize the licensed spectrum bands. In this paper, we study the PUprotection issue in multi-hop cognitive radio networks. In such networks, secondary users carefully select paths and time slots to reduce the interference to PUs. We formulate the routing and time-slot assignment problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). To solve the MILP which is NP-Hard in general, we propose an algorithm named RSAA (Routing and Slot Assignment Algorithm). By relaxing the integral constraints of the MILP, RSAA first solves the max flow from the source to the destination. Based on the max flow, RSAA constructs a new network topology. On the new topology, RSAA uses branch and bound method to get the near optimal assignment of time slots and paths. The theoretical analyses show that the complexity of our proposed algorithm is O(N

84862900053	Delay and throughput oriented continuous spectrum sensing schemes in cognitive radio networks	Periodic spectrum sensing over the entire primary user (PU) band always interrupts the secondary user (SU) data transmission in the sensing interval, which may degrade the quality of service of the SU. To alleviate this problem, we divide the PU band into two subbands, one for opportunistic SU data transmission, and the other for continuous spectrum sensing. Based on the PU band division, we propose a delay oriented continuous spectrum sensing (DO-CSS) scheme for delay sensitive SU services. In the DO-CSS scheme, the average SU transmission delay is reduced by selecting the proper bandwidth for spectrum sensing within each frame. Since different SUs may have different requirements on their quality of services, we further propose a throughput oriented continuous spectrum sensing (TO-CSS) scheme. In the TO-CSS scheme, the achievable average SU throughput is maximized by choosing the optimal sensing bandwidth within multiple adjacent frames. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results show that compared with the conventional periodical spectrum sensing scheme, the average transmission delay of the SU is reduced without degradation in the maximum achievable throughput by using the proposed DO-CSS scheme, and both the delay performance and achievable SU throughput are further improved by using the proposed TO-CSS scheme. © 2012 IEEE.

84863044829	IDSA-UP: An improved dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on user' priority	In this paper, with the aim of improving spectrum utilization, we proposed an improved dynamic spectrum access algorithm which was based on users' priority (IDSA-UP). In IDSA-UP, cognitive users with different priorities collaborated with each other, and power control was used to ensure that there was no interference between secondary and primary users(PUs) and the interference between secondary users (SUs) should meet the constrain. Then graph coloring was used to allocate the spectrum. Performance analysis and simulation results show that IDSA-UP algorithm can improve the spectrum utilization compared with color sensitive graph coloring (CSGC) algorithm and color sensitive graph coloring with tags deleted (CSGCTD). Consider that the number of secondary user is 10 in a square service area of size 100 × 100m2, the interference one SU suffered from other SUs is limited in 5% of the primary user' covering radius, the spectrum utilization increase 40%. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84863181613	A waiting-time auction based dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm in cognitive radio networks	Auction based dynamic spectrum access is an efficient approach to solve the spectrum shortage problem. However, conventional spectrum auction algorithms mainly concentrated on maximizing the revenue, under which the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) users with poorer cognitive abilities are usually hard to win the auction for spectrum access. In this paper, we propose a novel waiting-time auction (WTA) algorithm to improve the winning probabilities for the DSA users with poorer cognitive abilities. Specifically, we formulate the spectrum allocation as an auction game. In the auction, all game users bid with waiting time to obtain the spectrum access opportunities, unlike the conventional approaches where users bid by using money. Correspondingly, users with poorer cognitive ability, usually having the lower time cost, can win the auction with higher probabilities through bidding longer waiting time. We prove that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) in the WTA based spectrum-allocation game and the NE is desirable for all game users. Both theoretical and simulation analyses show that our proposed WTA algorithm can effective improve the winning probabilities of users with lower cognitive abilities. © 2011 IEEE.

84863127999	A channel-aggregation diversity based MAC protocol in power-constrained cognitive ad hoc networks	One of the major challenges in the medium access control (MAC) protocol design over cognitive Ad Hoc networks (CAHNs) is how to efficiently utilize multiple opportunistic channels, which vary dynamically and are subject to limited power resources. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we first propose a novel diversity technology called Channel-Aggregation Diversity (CAD), allowing each secondary node to use multiple channels simultaneously with only one data radio per node under the upperbounded power. Using the proposed CAD, we develop a CAD based MAC (CAD-MAC) protocol, which can efficiently utilize available channel resources through joint power-channel allocation while guaranteeing the transmission-time fairness. Particularly, we convert the joint power-channel allocation to the Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, such that we can obtain the optimal transmission strategy to maximize the network throughput through dynamic programming. Simulation results show that our proposed CAD-MAC protocol can significantly increase the network throughput as compared to the existing protocols. © 2011 IEEE.

84863133311	A joint sensing-time adaption and data transmission scheme in cognitive radio networks	Spectrum sensing is performed by secondary users (SUs) to detect primary users (PUs) in cognitive radio networks. The limited time duration allocated for spectrum sensing may result in high false alarm probability, which always leads to low spectrum utilization and degrades the SU throughput. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel joint sensingtime adaption and data transmission (JSTA-DT) scheme. In our proposed JSTA-DT scheme, two adjacent sensing periods are bundled to form a sensing block. In each sensing block, the SU performs partial time spectrum sensing in the first sensing period. If the sensing result indicates that the PU is absent, the SU transmits its data; otherwise, the SU performs full time spectrum sensing adaptively. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results show that compared to the conventional partial time spectrum sensing and data transmission scheme, the spectrum utilization and achievable SU throughput are improved significantly by using our proposed JSTA-DT scheme. © 2011 IEEE.

However, as most of OBUs always request the stored contents in the RSUs, how to update the contents in these RSUs when the original changes at its original servers has become an important issue to be dealt with. This paper proposes a novel method to resolve the above problem. Firstly, based on the characteristics of peers and geographical information, we decide which replica of which content in RSUs should be updated when its original changes. Secondly, by comparing the delivery cost of wired and wireless transmission, we decide whether the updated content should be delivered from a fixed peer or other mobile peers. Lastly, the detailed algorithm is presented and summarized. © 2011 IEEE.

84863163714	Statistical delay control and QoS-driven power allocation over two-hop wireless relay links	The time-varying feature of wireless channels usually makes the hard delay bound for data transmissions unrealistic to guarantee. In contrast, the statistically-bounded delay with a small violation probability has been widely used for delay quality-of-service (QoS) characterization and evaluation. While existing research on the statistical-delay control mainly focused on the single-hop links, in this paper we propose the QoS-driven power-allocation scheme over two-hop wireless relay links to statistically upper-bound the end-to-end delay for the decode-and-forward (DF) relay transmissions. Specifically, by applying the effective capacity and effective bandwidth theories, we first analyze the delay-bound violation probability over the two-hop link with independent service process in each hop. Then, we show that an efficient approach for statistical-delay QoS guarantees is to make the delay distributions of both hops identical, which, however, needs to be obtained through asymmetric resource allocations over the two hops. Motivated by this observation, we formulate and solve an optimization problem aiming at minimizing the total power consumptions to satisfy the specified end-to-end delay-bound violation probability over two-hop relay links. Also conducted is a set of numerical results to show the impacts of the QoS requirement, the traffic load, and the position of the relay node on the power allocation under our proposed scheme. © 2011 IEEE.

Specifically, our derived power allocation scheme aims at maximizing the effective capacity of the cognitive relay link, which can be seen as the maximum arrival rate supported by the system under given QoS constraints. In our work, not only the average total transmit power and average interference power constraints are considered, but also the impact of the interference from the primary link to the cognitive relay link is taken into consideration. Simulation results show that the effective capacity of the cognitive relay link varies with the statistical QoS constraints. In particular, the stringent QoS constraint will cause low effective capacity. Moreover, we observe that the average total transmit power and average interference power are two important parameters, which will obviously impact the performance of the cognitive relay link. In addition, we find that the transmission of the primary link will significantly affect the performance of the cognitive relay link, such that a larger transmit power of the primary link will cause the performance degradation of the cognitive relay link.

84867791128	Recall-based dynamic spectrum auction with the protection of primary users	Dynamic spectrum auction is considered as an effective solution to improve spectrum utilization efficiency in dynamic spectrum sharing networks because it can provide an economic incentive to motivate primary users to share their idle spectrum with secondary users. However, the primary users' own quality of services (QoS) cannot be guaranteed in case of demand peak because their spectrum is being used by the winners at auction. To solve this problem, we propose a recall-based dynamic spectrum auction (RBDSA) algorithm with which a primary base station (PBS) can auction its unused channels to some secondary wireless services providers (SWSPs) safely and economically. The PBS' users are granted a higher channel access priority than the SWSPs, then the PBS can recall some channels after auction to satisfy its demand if necessary. To maximize its profit from spectrum auction and self services, the PBS will reduce its excessive or deficient channels reservation, which is enforced with an introduction of punishment item in the PBS' utility. We show analytically that both the PBS and the SWSPs in the RBDSA algorithm are truthful and there is a weakly dominant equilibrium. Moreover, it can be extended to the scenarios with multiple units of channels demand and multiple PBSs. Simulation results show that the RBDSA algorithm can increase the utility of the PBS and improve the channels utilization efficiency while keeping the QoS of the primary users. © 2012 IEEE.

Delay incurred by this kind of suspension may be intolerable to delay sensitive SU services. To alleviate this problem, we adopt a parallel sensing and transmission paradigm (PSTP), within which the SU transmits and senses simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the achievable SU throughput and bandwidth allocated for spectrum sensing within the PSTP, under the constraint that the PU is sufficiently protected. We also study the delay improvements of the PSTP over that of the SSTP. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results that there exists an optimal sensing bandwidth that maximizes the achievable SU throughput within the PSTP.

And the fairness of resource allocation is another important problem in this network.In this paper, We present a joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm considering fairness (JSPACF) among secondary users (SUs) for OFDM-based CR networks. In JSPACF, we allocate the subcarriers to SUs in the first step, not only considering the channel gain and the interference introduced to primary users (PUs) by SUs, but also considering proportional fairness among SUs. Then in the second step, we allocate the power to the subcarriers to maximize sum capacity of all SUs with total power constraint and interference constraint, considering proportional fairness among SUs too. Theory analysis and simulation results show that JSPACF can offer the beneficial tradeoff between system performance and fairness, while largely reducing complexity compared to the optimal solution. © 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

However, SUs need to avoid the interference to PUs, imposing new challenges in routing protocol designs and throughput improvement in CR networks (CRN). In this paper we propose a cross-layer channel assignment and routing (CCAR) algorithm. Specifically, our CCAR algorithm aims at throughput maximization while addressing the interference avoidance issue in CRNs. Solving for the optimal solution towards throughput maximization is a NP problem. In contrast, we simplify this optimization problem by taking advantage of the correlation of data flow and routing information across the network nodes. Then, further making use of the adjacent hop interference (AHI) Information, we develop a heuristic approach to obtain a suboptimal solution.

84871502677	Expected path duration maximized routing algorithm in CR-VANETs	In Cognitive-Radio (CR) enabled Vehicular Ad-Hoc NETworks (CR-VANETs), high mobility of vehicles and dynamically varying spectrum occupation statuses frequently cause the established routes broken. To deal with the increasing mobility and dynamics of accessible spectrum, we propose an expected path-duration maximized routing (EPDM-R) algorithm in CR-VANETs. Specifically, we study the scenario of cognitive radio enabled vehicles communications freeway mobility model. the vehicles, as secondary users (SUs), can access the licensed channels of primary users (PUs) when these channels are not occupied, where the behaviors of PUs follow the call-based model. In the EPDM-R algorithm, we firstly calculate the expected link-duration for each link. Then, the max-bottleneck algorithm is used to solve for the route achieving the longest expected path-duration. Theoretic analysis prove the optimality of our proposed EPDM-R algorithm in terms of maximizing EPD. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has larger average path-duration than the Dijkstra based scheme and the scheme that does not take the PUs' behaviors into consideration. © 2012 IEEE.

84871515050	A variable breadth based adaptive tree search algorithm for MIMO systems	Near maximum-likelihood (ML) detections based on the tree search can approach the optimal performance with reduced complexity in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. The breadth-first scheme is widely applied in practical systems for its stable and upper-bounded throughput. However, the major drawback of breadth-first detection is still the relatively high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a variable breadth based adaptive tree search (VBA) scheme to further reduce the complexity. In particular, we introduce a variable metric constraint to dynamically regulate the searching breadth, which is determined by the accumulated metric of the partial zero-forcing (ZF) sequence at each layer of the searching tree during the adaptive candidate selection process. Simulation results and analysis show that the proposed algorithm can further reduce the detection complexity without degrading bit-error-rate (BER) performance. © 2012 IEEE.

84871950963	Statistical QoS driven power allocation for cognitive networks under primary user's outage probability constraint	Resource allocation is a critically important issue for cognitive networks, because it needs to not only meet the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for the secondary users (SU), but also protect the QoS of primary users (PU) from degradation. In this paper, we develop the optimal power allocation scheme for the cognitive network, which can satisfy the QoS requirements of SUs and PUs simultaneously. Specifically, on the one hand, as the deterministic delay QoS provisioning is usually unrealistic for practical wireless networks, we use the theory of effective capacity for SU's statistical delay QoS provisioning. On the other hand, in order to meet the PU's QoS demand, we impose the PU's outage probability constraint on the cognitive network instead of the traditional average and/or peak interference power constraints. Following the above concept, we derive the optimal power allocation scheme for the cognitive network under the SU's average and peak transmit power constraints and the PU's outage probability constraint. We find from simulation results that 1) the effective capacity of the cognitive network decreases as the statistical delay QoS requirement becomes stringent; 2) the performance of the cognitive network can be improved if the PU can tolerate higher outage probability; and 3) under the given average transmit power and PU's outage probability constraints, the cognitive network can achieve better performance while increasing the maximum peak transmit power, but the obtained performance gain for the stringent QoS requirement is more obvious than that for the loose QoS requirement. © 2012 IEEE.

84871963968	Inter-user interference suppression precoding based on SLNR for multi-user joint transmission in coordinated multi-point system	Joint transmission (JT) allows base stations (BSs) to serve multiple users (UEs) in the same time and frequency resources, wherefore inter-user interference (IUI) will arise. To solve this problem, an inter-user interference suppressed precoding (IUISP) scheme is proposed in this paper. IUISP contains two steps: firstly, we utilize the system degree of freedom to suppress interference generated by the signal of any UE leaking to all others at each BS independently with sharing the linear combination matrixes designed at UEs before precoding; secondly, based on IUI suppression, signal-to-leakage-and- noise ratio (SLNR) criterion is applied to attain better performance. It can be found that IUISP proposed in this paper can't need the channel state information (CSI) interaction between any two BSs in a cooperation cluster. Furthermore, the performance analysis and simulation results show IUISP has application value in noncoherent JT and can improve the system performance. © 2012 IEEE.

84871975954	Resource allocation and access strategy selection for QoS provisioning in cognitive networks	Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) strategy selection and the associated resource allocation are critically important issues for cognitive networks, because they need to not only satisfy the interference constraint caused to the primary users (PU), but also meet the delay quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for the secondary users (SU). In this paper, we develop the optimal resource allocation schemes for the underlay and overlay DSA strategies, respectively, in delay-QoS constrained cognitive networks. Specifically, for the underlay strategy, we find that 1) when the maximum average interference power is less than the maximum average transmit power, the cognitive network will gradually converge to an interference-power constrained system as the QoS constraint becomes more stringent; 2) when the maximum average interference power is larger than the maximum average transmit power, the cognitive network reduces to a transmit-power constrained system not varying with the QoS requirement. For the overlay strategy, we observe that 1) a unique optimal sensing time exists under the given QoS constraint; 2) the optimal sensing time increases as the QoS constraint gets more stringent. Following these results, we further propose a selection criterion across underlay and overlay DSA strategies. By applying this criterion, the SU can determine whether to use underlay or overlay for DSA under the given QoS constraint and the PUs' spectrum-occupancy probability. © 2012 IEEE.

We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem subject to a limited power constraint for each individual user and relay. Our resource allocation strategy aims at finding the best pairing scheme and optimal power allocation over subchannels in frequency and space domains. This turns out to be a mixed integer programming problem. We then derive an asymptotically optimal solution though the Lagrange dual decomposition approach.

84872866296	A survey on dynamic spectrum access protocols for distributed cognitive wireless networks	With the rapid development of wireless communications technologies, radio spectrum has become a type of extremely scarce resources in meeting the increasing demands for broadband wireless services. However, the traditional static spectrum allocation policy leads to severe spectrum underutilization and spectrum shortage problems. The cognitive radio (CR) technology can detect the occupancy of the spectrum and enable the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) to fill the spectrum hole caused by the static allocation policy, and thus has been widely recognized as an efficient approach to solve the above problems. The distributed cognitive wireless network (CWN), which does not have central entities, is one of the major networking architectures applying the CR technology. Correspondingly, the design of DSA in distributed CWNs is crucial, yet challenging, to increasing the utilization efficiency of the wireless spectrum with dynamically-varying occupancy statuses. In this article, we present a survey on DSA protocols for distributed CWNs. In particular, we first address the challenges in the design and implementation of distributed DSA protocols. Then, we categorize the existing distributed DSA protocols based on different criteria, such as spectrum sharing modes, spectrum allocation behaviors, spectrum access modes, the usage of common control channel, spectrum usage strategies, the number of radios, and spectrum sensing techniques. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each category under diverse classification criterion. Moreover, we make a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art distributed DSA protocols using different spectrum access modes, which can be categorized into contention-based, time-slotted, and hybrid protocols. Through the study, we find out that most of distributed DSA protocols fall into the contention-based and hybrid protocols. In addition, the ongoing standardization efforts are also reviewed. Finally, several open research issues for the distributed DSA protocols are presented, such as spectrum handoff based protocols, spectrum prediction based protocols, adaptation of the spectrum-sharing modes, protocols with cooperative spectrum sensing, as well as distributed collision avoidance mechanisms. © 2012 Ren et al.

84874410473	An improved LLR approximation algorithm for low-complexity MIMO detection towards green communications	As the number of transmit/receive antennas gets large in wireless communication systems, the drastically-increasing complexity in MIMO detection imposes significant challenges in implementing green communications while achieving high spectral efficiency. The winner-path-extension (WPE) K-best algorithm is an efficient detection algorithm in uncoded MIMO systems, known for its stable throughput and excellent symbol-error-rate (SER) and bit-error-rate (BER) performances under relatively low complexity. However, when applying the WPE K-best algorithm into coded MIMO systems, where soft-output information such as log-likelihood ratio (LLR) is required, missing counter-hypotheses issue in LLR calculation often degrades the error performance. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose an improved LLR approximation algorithm, such that WPE K-best algorithm can be well suited to coded MIMO systems. Specifically, when a counter-hypothesis misses, we set a metric threshold for the missing counter-hypothesis by calculating the metric of the bit flipping vector, and then randomly choose a value below the threshold as the approximation. We conduct simulation evaluations for our proposed algorithm in an 8 x 8 MIMO multiplexing system employing 16QAM modulation and Turbo coding. Simulation results show that compared with other existing LLR approximation schemes, our proposed approach can effectively improve the block-error-rate (BLER) performance as well as reducing the complexity in the tree search of WPE K-best algorithm. Moreover, we use a look-up table method to determine the Schnorr-Euchner (SE) enumeration order, which can further decrease the computational complexity of WPE K-best algorithms. © 2012 APSIPA.

Users in these three sectors are designed to utilize the non-coordinated approach, the static coordinated approach, and the dynamic coordinated approach, respectively. Second, we propose a method to identify the user's type in order to choose the best coordinated approach. Finally, we give a resource scheduling method to suit the novel clustering approach.

In this paper, a distributed routing and time-slot assignment (DRTSA) algorithm is proposed to addess the PU protection issue. Specifically, we first design a proper routing metric for distributed path selection and then we propose a time-slot assignment algorithm to improve SUs' capacity and reduce the interference to PU as well. Theoretical analysis shows that the complexity of DRTSA is no more than O(NTlogN), where N and T denote the number of nodes and the time-slot period in the network respectively.

On the subcarriers assigned to multicast services, BS transmits the superposition of unicast and multicast signals. Block diagonalization (BD) and power control are applied to unicast signal, to make sure interference from unicast not reduce the rate of multicast signal. We propose the optimal and a suboptimal user selection scheme to make the unicast rate as much as possible. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, the performance of the suboptimal scheme is close to that of the optimal approach, while the complexity is effectively decreased. Besides that, both the optimal and suboptimal schems can get better unicast rate than random selection while the multicast rate is the same as the one before superposition. © 2012 IEEE.

84876059529	A novel cooperative layered video multicast scheme	Multicast is a spectrum-efficient way to support emerging multimedia services over wireless network, where a group of users receive messages over a common wireless channel. Cooperative transmission is a promising technology to improve multicast performance by exploring the cooperative diversity. Different from conventional cooperative multicast schemes, we take the heterogeneity of the multicast group users into consideration and propose a novel two-stage cooperative scheme to accommodate different users with different video quality flexibly. Video streams are coded into base and enhancement layers using scalable video coding technology. The users that successfully decode base layer in stage 1 can receive enhancement layer from BS in stage 2, while the users with bad channel conditions only decode base layer with the help of fixed relays during two stages. The simulation results show that compared to previous multicast schemes, the proposed one can help the users with good channel quality achieve a better spectral efficiency performance while guarantee all users can receive basic video services. We also analyze the the impact of power allocation in stage 2 on the spectral efficiency of both layers. © 2012 IEEE.

84876063371	A multi-channel sensing order optimization algorithm based on markov prediction	This paper considers the scenario that the cognitive radio network has a wide spectrum band with multiple channels across different frequency band. Limited by the hardware capability, the secondary user can only sense one channel at each time slot. If the channel being sensed is not used by the primary user, the secondary user can access the channel and transmit data; otherwise, the secondary user has to wait until the next slot to choose a channel to sense. In this paper, we propose a multichannel sensing order optimization algorithm based on Markov prediction, with the knowledge of primary users' statistical information. According to this algorithm, each secondary user chooses the sensing channel based on Markov prediction, which reduces the sensing times and improve spectrum utilization efficiency. We also suggest a frequency-domain sensing-window adjustment strategy to reduce the probability of collision when there are more than one secondary users in the network. We define sensing efficiency to evaluate how quickly the secondary user can find an available channel for data transmission. Finally, the performance of the proposed optimization algorithm is evaluated through simulation results, and comparison analysis is conducted with the random channel selection strategy. © 2012 IEEE.

84878906367	Cognitive AF relay schemes for uplink transmission in macrocellular networks	Cognitive radio has been proposed to improve the spectrum utilization by allowing the unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to access the spectrum resources licensed to the primary users (PUs) opportunistically. However, the cognitive radio has rarely been employed to enhance the system performance of the licensed PUs that endure spectrum scarcity. To improve the outage-probability quality-of-service (QoS) of the mobile station (MS) in macrocellular networks, we propose two Cognitive Amplify-and-forward Relay (CAR) schemes in this paper. In our proposed CAR schemes, the MS and relay utilize both the licensed spectrum band (LSB) provided to the macrocellular network and the opportunistic spectrum band (OSB) discovered by the base stations. Simulation results show that compared with the conventional transmission schemes without cognitive relay, our proposals can effectively improve the outage performance of MS in macrocellular networks by exploiting both the space diversity and spectrum diversity. © 2012 IEEE.

As an modified version of traditional static or quasi-static spectrum auction, dynamic spectrum auction should not only increase the auction revenue of the owner of spectrum, but also improve spectrum utilization on fine time granularity. We propose a dynamic spectrum auction algorithm with time optimization (DSA-TO) in 802.22 networks. First, the effects of auction period on auction revenue and spectrum utilization are argued and optimized. Then we give a complete spectrum auction procedure where an adaptive reservation price is used to balance the revenue and utilization of spectrum auction. Performance analyses show that the DSA-TO algorithm can resist collusion effectively and has low complexity as well as good revenue and utilization. Simulation results show that the DSA-TO algorithm is reasonable in the optimization of auction period and can keep a fine spectrum utilization and bring more revenue for both single unit spectrum auction and multi-unit spectrum auction. © 2012 IEEE.

Moreover, different signals from different BSs can't be executed coherent combination directly in non-coherent JT. In this paper, a two-step precoding scheme (TSPS) is proposed to solve these problems. Firstly, an alternating minimization algorithm over the precoders at BSs and the interference subspace matrixes at UEs based on interference alignment (IA) is applied, which can force interference at each UE into the subspace and make each UE observe the interference-free desired signals. Secondly, we use the phase adjustment (PHA) based on QR decomposition to implement the coherent combination of desired signals from different BSs. This paper proves the convergence of alternating minimization algorithm in TSPS. Furthermore, numerical results show TSPS can improve the system performance by the IUI suppression and the signal coherent combination. © 2012 IEEE.

Therefore, it is a promising candidate for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. However, its detection performance is typically challenged by the noise uncertainty. Thus, the detection performance of energy detector in the presence of noise uncertainty needs to be evaluated. In this paper, we derive the decision rules for the energy detector in the presence of noise uncertainty by employing a widely used model. Firstly, we derive the decision rule for unknown deterministic signal when the noise power is uncertain. Second, we derive the decision rule for random Gaussian distributed signal when there is noise uncertainty. Then, we analyze the detection performance of the energy detector in the presence of noise uncertainty for both unknown deterministic signal and random Gaussian distributed signal. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results show that in the presence of noise uncertainty, our derived decision rules provide precise sensing thresholds for the energy detector. Furthermore, compared with the conventional decision rule obtained by overestimating the noise power, our decision rules provide performance gains in terms of signal to noise ratio. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The proposed detector consists of a processing unit and a combination and decision unit. In the processing unit, multiple statistics that correspond to different enhanced pilot components are computed. In the combination and decision unit, three newly proposed combination schemes are adopted to combine these statistics, and then, a final decision on the presence or absence of the DVB-T signals is made on the basis of the Neyman-Pearson criterion. The proposed pilot-aided detector exploits both the periodic continual and scattered pilots that are intrinsic in the DVB-T signals, processes the observed data timely, experiences short sensing duration, and requires no time synchronization information. Furthermore, the proposed pilot-aided detector is able to distinguish DVB-T signals from interference. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that spectrum bands that are not currently occupied by the DVB-T systems can be detected accurately by using the proposed pilot-aided detector.

84886723654	Joint sensing and transmission for AF relay assisted PU transmission in cognitive radio networks	Recent measurements show that there are abundant spectrum opportunities across the licensed cellular bands, over which the relay stations (RSs) are widely employed for both coverage extension and throughput improvement. However, current efforts in cognitive radios focus on exploiting spectrum holes over the licensed direct transmission links. To exploit new spectrum opportunities over the licensed relay assisted transmission links, we propose a novel two-phase joint sensing and transmission scheme (TP-JSTS) for the dual-hop Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relay assisted primary user (PU) transmission in cognitive radio networks. The TP-JSTS takes into account the relay behaviors of the PU system. In the first phase, the secondary user (SU) senses the signal transmitted by the PU base station (BS). In the second phase, the SU detects the signals sent by the PU-Relays. To protect the PU from harmful interference, the SU transmits within the current band in the rest of each phase only when the PU is detected to be absent. We investigate the sensing performance, throughput performance and delay performance of our proposed TP-JSTS when all the PU-Relays adopt the AF relay protocol. We obtain the optimal sensing-time allocation strategy that maximizes the achievable throughput of the SU and the optimal sensing-time allocation strategy that minimizes the average transmission delay of the SU. Simulation results show that there exists an optimal pair of sensing-time durations that maximizes the achievable throughput for the SU, while there exists another optimal pair of sensing-time durations that minimizes the average transmission delay for the SU. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

The data dissemination protocol for V2V applications should not only provide end-to-end transmissions with low error probability and high throughput but also offer antieavesdropping capabilities. To achieve this goal, we in this paper propose a secrecy-enhanced relaying protocol for vehicular environments. Based on the network topology and the velocity of the moving vehicles, the proposed scheme first generates the relay candidate set, from which a single relay is then selected opportunistically to assist the source. By using the superposition coding strategy, the selected relay jointly sends the source message and the artificial interference to enable secure communications. We derive the tight closed-form expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the secrecy outage probability, based on which we analyze the diversity order of the system. The method to generate the interference signal is introduced, and the choice of superposition weight factor is also given. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed relay-aided protocol yields a better performance than the competing alternatives in terms of both the secrecy performance and the implementation complexity. © 2013 Li Sun et al.

84891363102	A joint optimization of transmission mode selection and resource allocation for cognitive relay networks	Cognitive Radio has been widely regarded as an effective way to improve the spectrum utilization. In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN), the heterogeneity of spectrum availability often leads to link interruptions among Secondary Users (SUs). By deploying relay nodes, the link interruption problem can be effectively mitigated since relay nodes bring more freedoms for the system optimization. By jointly exploiting the multi-dimensional optimization flexibilities, including transmission mode selection, relay selection, and channel allocation, we in this paper propose a framework towards minimizing the outage percentage of SUs in cognitive relay networks. In particular, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem to achieve this goal, which is then transformed into a max-matching problem in the Graph Theory. Using the Hungary algorithm, the optimal solution to this problem is obtained with a polynomial computational complexity. Simulation results show that by combining advantages of multiple transmission modes, including direct transmission, amplify-and-forward, and decode-and-forward, our proposed joint transmission mode selection and resource allocation strategy can significantly reduce the occurrences of link interruptions in cognitive radio networks. © 2013 IEEE.

84891369374	Partial time-frequency resource allocation for device-to-device communications underlaying cellular networks	Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks have been considered as an efficient way to improve the system capacity of the cellular networks in an underlaying paradigm. However, increasing interferences between regular cellular communications and D2D communications often prevent the overall system throughput from being further enhanced. To address the corresponding interference management issue, we in this paper study the intelligent resource allocation for D2D pairs. Unlike the conventional resource allocation scheme where each D2D pair shares only one cellular user's entire resources upon approval, our approach allows D2D pairs to share only part of each cellular user's resources, such that the interference on regular cellular communications can be suppressed. In the mean time, D2D pairs can share multiple cellular users' resources to meet their own quality of services (QoS) requirement. Following the aforementioned principles, we propose a Partial Time-frequency Resource Allocation (PRA) framework for D2D communications. Under this framework, we design a category of sharing functions to map the channel status between D2D transmitters and cellular receivers to the resource proportion shareable for D2D users, through which a suboptimal yet simple and effective solution is derived, termed PRA scheme. Simulation results show that while meeting the D2D users' QoS requirement, our proposed PRA scheme can improve the overall system capacity and stability as compared to the conventional approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

In this paper, we propose a random-backoff enabled distributed scheduling scheme in CoMP systems, which aims at combating inter-cell interferences and efficiently enhancing the cell-edge users' spectral efficiency. Specifically, each base station (BS) uses the dynamic clustering algorithm to identify the cells causing the strongest interferences to its scheduled user. Then, in order to eliminate the strong interferences, each BS sends the coordination requests to BSs of these interfering cells. After exchanging coordination requests, each BS decides whether to continue transmissions for its scheduled user based on the coordination requests and the number of coordinated cells. If there are still collisions after coordination, the BSs of the corresponding cells use random backoff strategies for collision avoidance. Simulations results show that our proposed distributed scheme outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of the spectral efficiency of cell-edge users. © 2013 IEEE.

84893577773	An iterative screening strategy based on detection performance for multi-channel cooperative spectrum sensing	Cooperative spectrum sensing's false alarm probability and detection probability can be affected seriously when certain SUs with poor detection performance or some malicious SUs exist. To solve this problem, an iterative screening strategy based on detection performance (ISDP) strategy is proposed for multi-channel cooperative spectrum sensing in distributed CR networks. We divide time into fixed-length slots, during each slot, SU first senses channels by energy detection, and then broadcasts its local binary results to others using the common control channel (CCC). Once having received all of the other SU's binary sensing results, SU immediately executes the SU Adjust strategy to make its own decision on whether to continue sensing in next time slot or not. Finally, a two-slot forgetting function is executed to improve SU's local detection performance. In this manner, these SUs with poor detection performance can be screened out quickly one by one as time going on. Performance analysis and simulation results demonstrate that under a very easy condition, the ISDP strategy can effectively eliminate these sensing users with poor detection performance, decrease the number of cooperative users, and greatly improve the CR system's detection performance. © 2013 IEEE.

84893213182	Robust detection with stable throughput over ILL-conditioned channels for high-order MIMO systems	The conventional depth-first sphere decoder (DFSD) and breadth-first K-Best algorithm for MIMO detection are subject to unstable output throughput and error-rate degradation, respectively, over ill-conditioned channels. These problems become more serious in high-order MIMO systems with more antennas and larger constellation size. In this paper, we propose a condition-number driven decoder for high-order MIMO systems to overcome these problems. Specifically, we first apply K-Best algorithm with Winner-Path Enumeration (WPE) method on high layers of the detection tree to guarantee the throughput stability and apply DF-SD on remaining layers to lower the biterror- rate (BER). As the throughput fluctuation or, equivalently, complexity fluctuation of DF-SD often happens with a large condition number, we adaptively adjust the number of layers applying K-Best WPE by comparing the condition number with a predefined threshold, such that the complexity can be further decreased. Through theoretical analyses and simulation verifications, we derive a criterion of determining the number of layers adopting K-Best algorithm. Performance analyses and simulation evaluations show that our proposed scheme has much lower average complexity than K-Best WPE, while achieving nearoptimal BER performance and stable complexity / throughput.

84893236914	Joint user scheduling and power control for cell-edge performance improvement in backhaul-constrained network MIMO	Intercell interference severely degrades the performance of cell-edge users in cellular networks. To effectively manage the intercell interference, a heuristic scheme that jointly considers user scheduling and power control is proposed for multicell orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks with BS cooperation and limited backhaul capacity. First, a greedy user scheduling is proposed, taking both channel gain and the cost of directional cooperation into consideration. This scheme schedules the cell-edge users of all cells in the same subchannels. Second, under the guiding of user scheduling, the interference among cell-edge users of different cells can be preferentially cancelled with zero-forcing precoding. Third, a two-step power control is conducted to further improve cell-edge users performance. In the first step, with the strong duality of the nonconvex optimization subproblem, we obtain the minimum power consumption that guaranteeing the cellcenter users' rate requirement. In the second step, the residual power of per cell can be utilized to maximize cell-edge users performance. Then, with the fixed user scheduling, the iteration among interference cancelation and power control can be conducted until the backhaul capacity constraints are satisfied. Performance analysis proves the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and shows the effectiveness of the user scheduling. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm achieves a significant improvement of sum-rate for cell-edge users with negligible rate degradation for cell-center users. © 2013 IEEE.

84893630526	Adaptive grouping-modulation aided transceiver design for high-order MIMO systems	Recently, high-order Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems with tens of antennas and large constellation have attracted a great deal of research attention as the data rate and required spectral efficiency drastically increase. One of the major challenges for such systems is the design of low-complexity detector. In this paper, we propose an adaptive grouping-modulation aided transceiver design (AGM-TD) for high-order MIMO systems. By adopting adaptive grouping-modulation at the transmitter, AGM-TD algorithm divides the transmit antennas with different SNR level into two groups employing different modulation order. At the receiver end, two sub-MIMO systems associated with the two groups perform independent detection by applying orthogonal grouping. Moreover, in order to gain better bit error rate (BER) performance with an affordable complexity, an adaptive detector selection scheme for each sub-MIMO system is applied. Simulation evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain 2 ∼ 3dB performance gain when targeting BER at 10

84895056743	CAD-MAC: A channel-aggregation diversity based MAC protocol for spectrum and energy efficient cognitive Ad Hoc networks	In cognitive Ad Hoc networks (CAHN), because the contentions and mutual interferences among secondary nodes are inevitable as well as secondary nodes usually have limited power budget, spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency are critically important to the CAHN, especially for the medium access control (MAC) protocol design. Aiming at improving both spectrum and energy efficiencies, we in this paper propose a diversity technology called Channel-Aggregation Diversity (CAD), through which each node can utilize multiple channels simultaneously and efficiently allocate the upper-bounded power resource with only one data radio. Based on the proposed CAD technology, we further develop a CAD-based MAC (CAD-MAC) protocol, which enables the secondary nodes to sufficiently use available channel resources under the upper-bounded power and transmit multiple data packets in one transmission process subject to the transmission-time fairness constraint. In order to improve the performance of CAHNs, we propose two joint power-channel allocation schemes. In the first scheme, we aim at maximizing the data transmission rate. By converting the joint power-channel allocation to the Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, we derive the optimal allocation policy through dynamic programming. In the second scheme, our objective is to optimize the energy efficiency and we obtain the corresponding allocation policy through fractional programming. Simulation results show that our proposed CAD-MAC protocol can efficiently increase the spectrum and energy efficiencies as well as the throughput of the CAHN compared with existing protocols. Moreover, the energy efficiency of the CAHN can be further improved by adopting the energy efficiency optimization based resource allocation scheme. © 2014 IEEE.

84896703947	Two-pilot channel estimation scheme for amplify-and-forward relay networks	In amplify-and-forward relay networks, the equivalent channel to the destination node is not independent of equivalent noise and the equivalent noise does not follow a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, it is difficult to directly estimate the equivalent channel based on traditional optimal rules. In this paper, we propose a two-pilot estimation (TPE) scheme that decomposes a non-Gaussian noise channel estimation problem into two channel estimation problems in Gaussian noise. In TPE scheme, the relay-destination channel is first estimated by one pilot and the other pilot is used to estimate the equivalent channel with the aid of the estimated relay-destination channel. Simulation results show that the TPE scheme can achieve less estimation error and larger system throughput than other existing channel estimators in slow fading case.

84897459669	A hybrid underlay/overlay transmission mode for cognitive radio networks with statistical quality-of-service provisioning	In order to achieve better statistical Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning for cognitive radio networks (CRN), in this paper, we develop a hybrid underlay/overlay transmission mode for CRNs. Specifically, by applying the theory of effective capacity and taking PN's activity statistics into consideration, we first analyze the maximum achievable throughput of the CRN under two dominant transmission modes, namely underlay and overlay, respectively, and provide efficient algorithms to derive optimal transmission strategies for the two modes. Following the analyses, we then propose a hybrid underlay/overlay transmission mode, through which the cognitive users' QoS requirements can be better guaranteed and network throughput can be further improved. Moreover, we analyze the optimal transmission strategies for both underlay and overlay modes under two limiting cases. Analyses indicate that 1) for the loose QoS requirement, optimal transmission strategies for both underlay and overlay modes become the water-filling algorithm; and 2) for the stringent QoS requirement, the cognitive user will transmit with constant rate. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect channel estimations on our proposed transmission mode is discussed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the impacts of delay QoS requirements and PN's activity statistics on maximizing the delay-constrained throughput for both underlay and overlay modes and verify the effectiveness of our proposed transmission mode. Moreover, for the overlay mode, we observe that 1) a unique optimal sensing time exists under the given QoS constraint; and 2) the optimal sensing time surprisingly increases as the QoS constraint gets more stringent. © 2014 IEEE.

84898989573	Precoding for MU-MIMO system in low scattering channel environments	In Multi-user Multi-input Multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems, the most popular method to eliminate the multi-user interferences is projecting every user's precoding matrix into the null space of the rests' channels, so that data streams intended for different users would be transmitted in orthogonal spaces. However, while users having mutual correlated channels caused by the increased density of smart phones nowadays, this method would make correlated subspaces unused by data transmission for any user, and cause the reduction of overall throughput. To address the corresponding issue, we in this paper study the efficient precoding scheme that can eliminate the multi-user interferences as well as maximize the system capacity for MU-MIMO system in the spatially low scattering channel environments. Unlike the existing methods, our approach allows high-QoS-requirement users' precoding matrices to lie in the correlated subspaces between the channels of these primary users and the rests, so that more data streams can be transmitted to the primary ones simultaneously. In the mean time, in order to avoid the multi-user interferences, we require that every correlated channel can only be occupied by one user's precoding matrix. Following the aforementioned principles, we propose a Correlated Channels Utilized Precoding (CCUP) scheme for MU-MIMO system. Under this scheme, we also propose a different utilizing criterion of correlated subspaces to satisfy the networks with same-QoS-requirement services, in which every user's precoding space can be broadened by adopting partial correlated subspaces, termed Fair CCUP (F-CCUP) scheme. Simulation results show that while keeping no multi-user interferences, our proposed CCUP scheme can greatly increase the number of allowed independent data streams, and improve the overall capacity of MU-MIMO system in spatially correlated propagation environments compared to the existing approach. © 2013 IEEE.

84903125098	Parallel resource allocation algorithm for throughput maximization in LTE uplink systems	In order to avoid inter carrier interference owing to Doppler frequency shift, the continuous resource allocation mechanism is adopted in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) uplink systems. Most resources cannot be allocated according to the better channel status because of this mechanism. Therefore, the flexibility of allocation and the achievable system throughput are limited. Concerning these issues, a Parallel Resource Allocation Algorithm using bisection (PRAA-UB) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm includes the matching mechanism and resource partition mechanism. The former allocates a Resource Block (RB) with the best current channel status to each user, and the latter divides resources between neighboring allocated RBs using dichotomy, based on the user's minimum data rate requirement and the principle of data rate maximization. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm in this paper can achieve higher system throughput and user's fairness, and the complexity is reduced. © 2014 WIT Press.

84903176565	Distance and norm based antenna selection for generalized spatial modulation in correlated MIMO fading channels	Against the poor average bit error probability (ABEP) and capacity performance of Generalized Spatial Modulation (GSM) system in correlated fading channels, we propose a technique called the Distance and Norm based Antenna Selection (DN-AS). In this method, we improve the capacity of both the spatial and signal constellations of GSM as much as possible. By jointly considering the distance metric of the channel column space and the channel gain norm, antennas are discarded from the candidate antenna set according to the greedy algorithm until a suboptimal antenna set is obtained. Simulations demonstrate substantial ABEP and capacity performance improvement of our scheme over the existing baseline algorithms at all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without significant increase in computational complexity. In addition, the proposed scheme can be readily applied to independent fading channels and maintain the same or even better performance. © 2014 WIT Press.

Firstly an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the overall outage probability under the constraint of energy limitations due to energy harvesting. Further the problem is approximated and then simplified into a geometric programming problem, based on which the simple power allocation and its corresponding best-relay selection scheme is developed. Simulation results verify the outage performance gain of the developed scheme. © 2014 IEEE.

84904095609	Combating time-duration uncertainty of spectrum resources: A risk-reduced auction approach	Dynamic spectrum auction has been widely recognized as a promising solution to spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks. However, the performance of dynamic spectrum auction is significantly affected by the uncertainty of the available time of spectrum opportunities. To combat this uncertainty, we propose risk-reduced auction (RRA) mechanism in this paper. Specifically, we study the scenario where a cognitive base station (CBS) auctions spectrum opportunities to secondary users (SUs). Modeling the traffic pattern of primary users (PUs) as an alternating renewal process, we derive the optimal auction time to maximize the auctioneer's utility to combat the time-duration uncertainty. In the meantime, a collision probability constraint is imposed to protect the PU's priority on spectrum utilization. We show analytically that both the auctioneer and the SUs are truthful and there is a weakly dominant equilibrium in the RRA algorithm. Moreover, the SUs bidding risk can be effectively reduced. Also conducted is a set of simulation evaluations which demonstrate the improvement of both auctioneers and SUs' utilities achieved by using our proposed RRA algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

84906996841	A novel algorithm to cache vehicular content with parked vehicles applications	With the rapid development of vehicular and ICT technologies, Vehicular Content Networks (VCNs) play an important role in facilitating better road safety and comfortable driving. Because the content, such as traffic reports and disaster warning messages, must be delivered efficiently and timely, how to guarantee and improve the performance of VCNs becomes a hot issue. Recently, caching with the parked vehicles shows its efficiency to distribute the large-sized vehicular content. However, the related caching algorithm has not been studied thoroughly. In this paper, based on the analyses of the arrival of vehicles, mobility in parking area and access pattern of vehicular content, we propose an algorithm to decide how to use the cached replicas in the parking area to provide users with the requested content. Simulation results prove that our proposal can outperform the conventional methods. © 2014 IEEE.

To achieve high sum rate, a new relay beamformer is designed to support multi-pair source-destination communication links as well as an energy receiver simultaneously, instead of serving one information transmitter at a time. An energy-harvesting constrained sum-rate maximisation problem for this design is formulated, then relaxed and reformulated into a series of convex problems, which can be iteratively solved in polynomial time, eventually leading to a high-rate beamforming solution. Simulation results confirm the performance gain and fast convergence of the developed beamforming design.

84912136338	Joint subcarrier and power allocation for reciprocally-benefited spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks	Aiming at reducing the outage probability of primary users (PU) and obtaining spectrum resources for secondary users (SU), in this paper, we proposed a joint subcarrier and power allocation scheme (JSPA) for reciprocally-benefited spectrum sharing with SUs cooperating with PUs. In JSPA scheme, SUs adopt the decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocol to help PUs in a two-stage way. Meanwhile, a fraction of unallocated licensed spectrum is allocated for the secondary transmission in every stage. However, if the two-stage cooperation still cannot satisfy PUs' outage quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, SUs then switch to the access mode to entirely capture the licensed spectrum. Our proposal is to maximize the average transmission rate of SUs through joint allocation of subcarriers and power. The closed-form expressions about the outage probability and average transmission rate of both PUs and SUs are derived. Simulation results show that compared with the conventional cognitive cooperation schemes, the average transmission rate of SUs improves.

84919429594	Interference mitigation via CECRS precoding in a two-tier heterogeneous network with cooperative femtocells	The coexistence of a macrocell and a number of femtocells often leads to a two-tier heterogeneous network, where the co-tier interference (CotIN) and cross-tier interference (CrotIN) both degrade users' quality of service. In order to mitigate the two types of interferences, we propose a precoding scheme for the cooperative femtocells, called CotIN elimination and CrotIN suppression (CECRS) precoding. In this scheme, we first eliminate the CotINs of each user by applying the QR decomposition to channel matrix. Then, the CrotINs of MUs and FUs are suppressed by the macrocell base station (MBS) and femtocell access points (FAPs), respectively. The CECRS scheme doesn't require much information exchange between the MBS and FAPs, and thus significantly reduce the difficulty of its implementation. Simulation results show that the CECRS effectively improves the users' transmission rates.

84919459166	Efficient power control via non-cooperative target SINR competition in distributed wireless networks	Power control strategy that guarantees users' quality-of-service (QoS) in a power-efficient manner is a critical yet challenging issue in distributed wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem by considering the energy consumption and QoS provisioning simultaneously, where the QoS requirement is specified by the target signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The problem is represented as multi-objective optimization at each individual user. Then, we cast the formulation within a non-cooperative game framework where the weighted sum of the original objectives is the payoff function. Following our analyses on the properties of Nash equilibrium, we propose the target-SINR oriented power control (TOPC) strategy, which has the advantage of distributed implementation. Further, we reveal the condition for TOPC to converge and illustrate its performance in the extreme cases. Simulation results confirm our analytical results and demonstrate that, compared with the counterparts, our proposal more effectively guarantees users' QoS with efficient power utilization.

Thus, managing energy efficiency should be the first priority for mobile terminals. In this paper, our aim is to improve the users' energy efficiency in heterogeneous network environments. To this end, we propose a network selection mechanism that exploits both user and network context information in order to efficiently utilize the radio wireless resources in heterogeneous network. The mechanism enables the multi-mode mobile terminal to select and connect to the network of attachment that maximizes its average energy efficiency and guarantees a supported quality of service for its connections. The performance of the proposed mechanism is compared against the maximum battery lifetime scheme and priority LTE access scheme in terms of the energy consumption, the throughput and the energy efficiency. According to simulation results, the system that employs the proposed network selection mechanism achieves better performance improvement in improving the user average throughput and energy efficiency.

84921027633	Sustainability-driven power control for energy harvesting enhanced wireless transmission	Battery-powered wireless nodes' lifetime can be significantly extended by integrating energy-harvesting function. As energy-harvesting is a highly varying process, the guarantee of batteries' sustainability becomes extremely crucial for nodes that record and deliver multimedia content. We in this paper propose a sustainability-driven power control scheme for wireless transmission with energy-harvesting function. In particular, we first present a statistical sustainability guarantee framework, where the probability of battery-low status needs to be lower than a specified threshold. Then, by developing a novel inversely-queuing technique, we can readily apply the effective bandwidth/capacity theory to explicitly identify the battery-low probability as a function of the energy harvesting and consuming processes. Following these results, we formulate the throughput maximization problem subject to the statistical sustainability constraint. We then solve for the optimal sustainability-driven power control scheme and discuss its associated characteristics. A set of simulation results are also presented to show the superiority of our proposed scheme as compared to the baseline schemes such as the constant-power variable-rate scheme and constant-rate variable-power scheme.

84924353135	Buffering-aided resource allocation for type i relay in LTE-advanced cellular networks	3GPP LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) cellular networks support relay transmissions to improve the cell-edge users throughput as well as the system capacity, so that mobile communications services including multimedia transmissions, data download, real-time online gaming, etc., can be served with better quality-of-services (QoS). In LTE-A networks, Type I relay is widely used, where the relay station (RS) and evolved Node B (eNB) independently schedule and allocate resource for their served user equipments (UE). Existing research often assumes that the backhaul link (connecting eNB and relay) and the access link (connecting relay and UE) employ the same transmission rate, in order to avoid traffic congestions at the RS without queuing buffer. However, this makes the total relay throughput subject to the worse channel quality between the backhaul link and access link, thus severely degrading the system capacity as the wireless channels vary with time. To overcome this problem, this paper enables buffering function at RSs and proposes a buffering-aided three-step resource allocation scheme, which can efficiently make use of the time-varying channel qualities for data delivery. Furthermore, optimizations for the long-term fairness and overall network throughput are jointly designed. Also conducted is a set of system-level simulations to evaluate the performances of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can not only improve the average network throughput compared with existing baseline schemes, but also achieve better long-term fairness over RS-served UEs and eNB-served UEs.

84924371133	Coalition-assisted energy efficiency optimization via uplink macro-femto cooperation	In this paper, we develop a macro-femto cooperation strategy for uplink transmissions of multi-channel two-tier networks, which aims at alleviating the co-channel interference and optimizing the energy efficiency of macro-users (MUEs) and femto-users (FUEs) simultaneously. Specifically, the features of our work include three folds. First, our proposed strategy allows the MUE to select a femto-access point (FAP) to perform hybrid access, which efficiently eliminates the cross-tier interference. Second, by adopting the coalitional game in partition form, the users with strong mutual interference form a coalition to share the channel in a time-division multiplexing manner such that the intra-coalition interference can be avoided. The corresponding time-division policy is obtained by employing the Nash bargaining solution. Third, the inter-coalition resource competition problem is solved within a non-cooperative energy efficiency game framework and the transmit power for each user is derived through Nash equilibrium. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed strategy can efficiently improve the energy efficiency of FUEs. Also provided are simulation results which demonstrate the performance superiority of our developed strategy over the non-cooperative scheme in terms of user's energy efficiency and data transmission rate.
