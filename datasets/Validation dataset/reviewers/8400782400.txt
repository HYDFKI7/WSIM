84928182763	The use of attributes matching for PP- and pswave event registration	PP- and PS-wave event registration is one of the "bottlenecks" that limit the application of the multicomponent seismic data. Most existing methods for event registration assume that the PP- and PSwaves have similar waveforms, directly correlating the PP- and PS-wave stacked or migrated sections for registration purposes. Here, we propose an indirect matching method based on prestack inversion. Using prestack inversion, we can obtain shear-wave (S-wave) information from both PP- and PS-waves, which makes it possible to perform a "like-by-like" comparison during event registration. To implement this approach, we design a prestack PP inversion scheme, generating a "pseudo PS-wave" (PPS) section in PP time which shows good similarity to the recorded PS-waveforms in PS time. Both numerical modeling and real data are used to illustrate this work flow with improved waveform similarity and accuracy in event registration. Therefore, we argue that attributes matching with prestack PP-wave inversion may provide an alternative and better approach to PP- and PS-wave event registration.

23044484272	Study on self-balance design theory of culvert grid advanced in pipe-roof in saturated soft soil layers	At present, during the construction of advancing culvert box at home and abroad, the soil in front of box should be reinforced to retain stability. The tunnel of Shanghai Middle Ring Line located in the intersection of Hongxu Road and Beihong Road will be the first case to adopt pipe roof culvert box advancing scheme without reinforcing the saturated soft soil layer to decrease project cost. In order to sustain the stability of surface and control the ground settlement during the construction, the reasonable design of girding will be crucial. Based on the principle of mechanics and some hypothesis, this paper takes advantage of the balance between friction and earth pressure in grid, and presents a kind of self-balance design theory. A differential equation is set up and the distribution and attenuation rules of soil pressure, normal stress, shear stress etc. are obtained. These rules of stress distribution and attenuation conform to a series of exponential equations. In addition, the critical length of grid and the relations among length, width and height have been obtained from the equations. Also, the main factors affecting the critical length of grid are analyzed from these equations and are obtained as follows: the soil pressure in front of grid; frictional property between soil and grid wall; soil friction angle and cohesion. Analysis indicates that the critical length is increased as the soil pressure increasing and decreased as the friction factor increasing. These equations and results can be regarded as academic foundation for grid design for soft soil layers.

23444441010	Design method for cross-section sizes of grids inserted in the front of a box culvert surrounded by pipe-roof	The subway crossing project through Hongxu Road in Shanghai is the pipe-roof project with the biggest cross-section box culvert up to now in the world. It is constructed in saturated soft soil stratum in the Beihong Road located in the middle ring-road in Shanghai. In order to keep cutting surface stable during pushing the box culvert in the front of which many steel grids are inserted; it is very important to design rational sizes of grids. According to analysis of soil arch effect near the cutting surface of the back end of a grid, rational design approach of cross-section sizes of grids is given on the basis of three important conditions, namely mechanical equilibrium equations, shear intensity principle of soil, and self-stability condition of soil mass. Its concrete calculation procedure is given in detail with the practical project.

24344449680	Distribution mode of earth pressure on inner plates of steel grids located in the front of a big box culvert surrounded by pipes in a pipe-roof project	Up to now, the subway crossing project through Hongxu Road is a pipe-roof project with the biggest cross-section of box culvert in the world. It is constructed in saturated soft soil stratum under the Beihong Road located in the middle ring-road of Shanghai. During pushing the box culvert in the front of which many steel grids are inverted, earth pressure on inner plates of a grid will vary with excavation of soil near the back end of the grid. Its general rule is that earth pressure is of different value at various distance from cutting surface. According to the mechanical equilibrium conditions, earth pressures on inner top and bottom plate are exponentially distribution along the longitudinal direction of a grid and those on inner side plates are superposition of exponential distribution along the longitudinal direction and linear distribution along the vertical direction of the same grid until reaching their corresponding original status at the fore end of the grid after attaining new mechanical equilibrium status. It is the important basis of rational design of grid sizes. In the end, the theoretical calculation method is proved by the model test. The distribution mode is given in detail by the practical project.

It is constructed in saturated soft soil stratum in the Beihong Road located in the middle ring-road in Shanghai. Coefficients of friction between the box culvert and mixture composed of thixotropic slurry and clay or steel pipe are of great importance for rationally designing jacks used for pushing the culvert. The coefficients are studied by test. Five kinds of mixtures composed of different proportional thixotropic slurry and clay are used for test. The results show that the coefficients reach maximum when the mixture is completely composed of clay and they reach or approach minimum when the mixture is completely composed of thixotropic slurry. In addition, the coefficients will decrease generally as mass of thixotropic slurry proportion to mass of clay increases.

For one direction discrete and two directions analytical, this method can simplify the 3-dimensional computation of displacement to one dimension, which can save computation time dramatically for its quick convergence. Furthermore it can simulate infinite soil field, avoid introducing the redundant boundary condition compared with FEM, and can acquire precise results. An example has been calculated with semi-analytical element method by changing the substitution ratio, improving the depth and modulus ratio of pile to soil of composite foundation. The results indicate that increasing the substitution ratio and the modulus ratio of pile to soil has negligible effect to reduce displacement, while improving the depth can affect the settlement obviously. So it is reasonable to increase the improved depth to reduce composite foundation settlement where the optimum design is controlled by ground settlement.

23744508789	Foundation reinforcement and building rectification of deviation by jack-up and preloading underpinning pile	A 3-story brick concrete structural building was added to 7-story in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province; and the new-added part is a frame structure. Because two different structural systems are not separated completely and the designer adopted unsuitable ground treatment method, the building became leaning seriously when the major structure was completed. The inclination ratio and settlement rate of building are up to 18.6‰ and 9.15 mm per day, respectively; and the building is bound to collapse. The scheme of rectifying deviation by jack-up and by preloading underpinning pile was employed after investigation for sake of safety. Based on this case, the following aspects are investigated: the formula to determine the numbers of underpinning piles for rectifying leaning building is presented; scheme choice of rectifying deviation, designing method, construction procedure of preloading underpinning pile, jacking monitoring and controlling are introduced in derail; difficult factors and corresponding problems during jacking construction are provided. After 3-day jack-up construction, the inclination ratio of building is steady at 0.53‰ and settlement rate is less than 0.0077 mm per day and tends to be stable. After five years regular service, it can be concluded that preloading underpinning pile is feasible to reinforce or rectify similar structures and project in loess region.

The results indicate that the design scheme of the project is feasible. It can ensure the stability of the slurry wall and backup wall, and does not affect the precision of jacking direction.

26644453001	Support effect analysis of upper pipe-roof during a box culvert being pushed within pipe-roof	Up to now, the subway crossing project through Hongxu Road is a pipe-roof project with largest cross-section box culvert in the world. It is constructed in saturated soft soil stratum in the Beihong Road located in the middle ring-road in Shanghai. Based on restrictions of ground settlement and extremely dangerous potential sliding condition on soil in front of the box culvert during the culvert being pushed slowly and some soil being excavated, support effect of upper pipe-proof is analyzed in order that mechanical characteristics of the pipe-roof can be completely known. Because different segments of these pipes have different mechanical status, they are analyzed mainly by supported beam model with two fixed ends and beam on elastic foundation model. Support effect of the upper and middle pipe is analyzed in detail in the practical project. The results show that the pipe-roof plays an important mechanical role in the course of the culvert being pushed. It can support quite a little weight of soil on it so that only partial weight will transfer to the stratum under it. So the pipe-roof can be benefit for economic and rational design of steel grids inverted in the front of the culvert for stabilizing the cutting surface.

It has been found from this research that the range of surface movement increases moderately with the collapse of jambs and the increase of the roof span. The subsidence area ranges from 1.5 times to 1.7 times of the roof span and the subsidence curves are symmetrical to the vertical line through the point with maximum subsidence. The horizontal movement, however, is not symmetrical and its impacting area is larger than the range of subsidence, with its maximum value equal to 40% of the maximum subsidence. In addition, the layer separation exists in the end of span of overburden if the subsidence happens in whole overburden, which is resulted from the shear failure of the bedding plane.

33750583416	Vertical deformation prediction on upper pipe-roof during a box culvert being pushed within a pipe-roof	Up to now, the subway crossing project through Hongxu Road is a pipe-roof project with the biggest cross-section of box culvert in the world. It is constructed in saturated soft soil stratum in the Beihong Road located in the middle ring-road in Shanghai. During the box culvert being pushed within the steel pipe-roof in the practical construction, the upper pipe-roof presents mainly upheaving deformation. According to analyzing mechanical equilibrium conditions on the culvert and sliding soil mass in front of it, the additional load on the upper pipe-roof is got. One of the upper and middle steel pipes can be thought of as a beam laid conversely on Winkler foundation and pressed by the additional load. The vertical deformation of the upper and middle steel pipe-roof can be predicted by the mechanical model. The theoretical results are compared with the monitoring results during the culvert being pushed. It is found that they are approximately same on variation characteristics and values, which shows the prediction method is reasonable in some degree.

It is made of 80 phi 970 steel pipes with interlocks forming a rectangular type of pipe curtain. Stability of the excavation face and the controlling of ground settlement during construction are obtained by box grid and steel pipe roof. The heave of ground surface is produced during the box grid extruding into the soil as culvert box jacking forward. To study the mechanism of pipe roof, such as ground heave magnitude, range, uplift force and steel pipe flexural rigidity, pipe roof is simplified as longitudinal grade beam. The pipes ahead of grid bear uplift force within the range of passive sliding zone, and other parts of them lay on elastic foundation. This model can calculate heave magnitude, range and uplift force, etc.

33845452243	Characterizing volcanic gas reservoirs using PP and PS seismic data: Case study	Nowadays multicomponent seismic has gained more and more acceptance from the hydrocarbon industry than was the case several years ago. Nevertheless, the anticipated breakthrough into a mainstream technology is still to be realized. One of the bottlenecks is the lack of convincing data examples that demonstrate the full benefit of the technology. This is particularly true for land multicomponent seismic. As a step towards filling this gap, we present a case study of using land PP and PS converted-waves for characterizing volcanic gas reservoirs in Daqing Oilfield in Northeast China. The PP and PS data are recorded by digital MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) sensors and are of very high quality. The PP- and PS-migrated sections show a very high degree of correlation in structural features, although the PP-section appears to delineate faults more clearly than the PS-section. Analysis of the P- and S-waves from the target formation at the ten borehole locations reveals very consistent P- and S-wave velocity and amplitude anomalies. From the gas producing wells, the P-wave reflections are consistently weak and scattered, whilst the PS-wave reflections are consistently strong and continuous. In contrast to the non-producing wells, both PP- and PS-waves show continuous and strong reflections. The gas reservoirs can then be delineated from joint PP- and PS-amplitude analysis and the results agree with the drilling results in the study area. This confirms the benefit of using multicomponent seismic data. © 2005 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

To overcome this problem, a multicomponent seismic experiment was set up to evaluate the converted-waves recorded by digital MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) sensors. The experiment includes six 2D lines, passing through ten boreholes drilled for the volcanic reservoirs. Several multicomponent VSPs have also been acquired for correlation purposes. Analysis the P- and S-waves from the target formation at the ten borehole locations reveals very consistent P- and S-wave amplitude anomalies. From the gas producing wells, the P-wave reflection is consistently weak and scattered, whilst the PS-wave reflection are consistently strong and continuous.

In this paper, we evaluate converted-wave seismic data acquired over volcanic gas reservoirs. The converted-wave data reveals a significant amount of shear-wave splitting over the volcanic formation, and we develop a technique to extract the shear-wave polarization and time delay from the data. The technique is particularly designed for evaluating converted-wave splitting for 2D or 3D data with a narrow-azimuth distribution. We adopt a rotation-scanning procedure that maximizes the separation of the fast and slow split shear-waves. It is interesting that the amount of splitting determined from the data can be correlated to the known gas reservoirs, revealing a potential to use shear-wave splitting to delineate gas reservoirs in volcanic rocks.

33947261209	The two-parameter approximation to-seismic reflection traveltimes	The seismic reflection traveltime curves are complicated, and depend on many parameters. There is a need for simplified equations involving a reduced number of parameters that can be estimated from data and used for moveout correction and velocity model building. Many authors have derived explicit equations for traveltime as a function of offset, involving several parameters depended on velocity. Some authors have also applied the approach in which velocity varies with offset. Here we present a new approach in which the velocity variation with depth or vertical travel time instead of offset. A simple linear variation of velocity is used to derive expressions for traveltime and offset as a function of ray parameter. Only two parameters are involved in defining the velocity depth profile, which leads to an implicit traveltime equation depending on only two parameters. However, the resulting traveltime-offset curves are very accurate for both short and long offsets. Alternatively, a two-parameter equation involving linear variations of slowness with depth or vertical travel time can also be obtained. Both the velocity and slowness expressions can be used for velocity analysis and moveout correction. Synthetic records are used to demonstrate their effectiveness.

However, most studies on spatial resolution are limited to a homogeneous medium and thus are not applicable to layered or complex media. We have filled this gap by developing a numerical algorithm for estimating spatial resolution in layered media. Using Berkhout's focusing approach, we extrapolate the wave field with Rayleigh integration and calculate the spatial resolution of layered media using a recursive numerical method. This makes it possible to calculate the spatial resolution for different imaging planes, corresponding to different dip angles and acquisition geometries. This numerical scheme has been tested on a homogenous model to verify its accuracy, and applied to a three-layer physical model. Results show that the algorithm presented here provides an effective method for designing seismic acquisitions and for analysing the spatial resolution of seismic imaging algorithms. © 2007 Nanjing Institute of Geophysical Prospecting.

37549025410	Effects of fracture scale length and aperture on seismic waves: An experimental study	In this paper, we investigate the effects of fracture scale length and aperture on seismic wave propagation through seismic physical modeling. The physical models are constructed from a solid background of epoxy resin with inclusions of silicon rubber chips of different diameter and thickness to simulate fractures with different scale length and aperture. The chips embedded in each model are of the same diameter and thickness, and the fracture density is kept constant for all models. P and S waves that propagate parallel and perpendicular to the fractures are then recorded using a pulse transmission method. The experimental results show that given the same fracture density the changing of diameter has only a minor effect on the P-wave velocity and amplitude, and there are also little effects on the shear-wave amplitudes. The main observable effect is an increase of the slow shear-wave velocity with diameter, leading to a decrease in shear-wave splitting with diameter. The changing of fracture thickness (aperture) also has only a small effect on the shear-wave except an obvious decrease in the slow shear-wave velocity, leading to an increase of shear-wave splitting with thickness. However, the increasing in fracture thickness induces a strong attenuation in the P-wave, in particularly for the P-wave propagating perpendicular to the fracture. © 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

58049168258	Estimating frequency-dependent seismic attributes by matching pursuit: A case study	This paper investigates the use of spectral decomposition for extracting information on fluid properties. Traditional theory for detecting fluid response is based on the pure elastic Gassman theory, and the resultant seismic effects are frequency-independent. Using dynamic fluid substitution, we demonstrate that the frequency response of seismic reflection and its resultant attenuation and dispersion are directly linked to fluid saturation. To extract this information, we develop an accurate two-stage spectral decomposition method by matching pursuit. This allows us to calculate a range of frequency-dependent attributes, such as, absorption coefficient and amplitude gradient in the frequency domain. Application to real data shows a good link between the anomalies and hydrocarbon saturation. The results highlight that careful data processing and modeling are necessary to understand the complex effect of different fluids on the spectral response and enable robust interpretation.

The P- and S-wave velocities are computed from the recorded three component (3C) VSP, from which other elastic parameters such as bulk modulus (K), Poisson's ratio (σ) are calculated. Using the down-going wavefield separated from the borehole VSP records, we obtain the Q model using the spectral ratio method. We then apply inverse Q filtering to a surface seismic dataset across the borehole using a stable inverse Q filtering method to improve the resolution of the surface seismic dataset. Correlating the corridor-stacked VSP seismic traces to surface seismic section before and after inverse Q filtering shows that the resolution of the surface seismic data and the matching of seismic events between the surface data and the VSP corridor stack are both significantly improved after the application of the VSP-derived inverse Q filtering.

80052498182	Improving PS converted-wave imaging by compensating for the diodic effects of gas cloud: A case study from Sanhu	PS converted-waves (C-waves) have been commonly used to image through gas cloud, but the C-wave imaging may also be degraded by the diodic effect introduced by the gas cloud. For C-waves, the imaging quality may change with shooting direction due to the gas cloud, and this is referred to as the diodic effect. This diodic effect may be compensated for using a velocity perturbation method which decouples the diodic moveout into two parts: the base velocity and the velocity perturbation. In this paper, a land 2D3C seismic dataset is analyzed from the Sanhu area in the Qaidam basin, northwest China and significant diodic effects are observed in the data. The perturbation approach is applied to this data and the resultant C-wave imaging and the details of the reservoir structure are significantly improved.

84866550609	An inversion method for near-surface shear-wave velocity using multi-component seismic data	In land multi-component seismic data processing, the accurate near-surface shear-wave velocity is needed in converted-wave static correction. In this paper, we propose a method in which the near-surface shear-wave velocity can be inverted by X and Z component data after analyzing the wave field of multi-component seismic record. Horizontal slowness and polarization angle can be derived using refracted wave information in X and Z component, and then the shear-wave velocity can be inverted. The method is tested on model data and real data. The results show the inverted near-surface shear-wave velocity is reliable, and can be used to characterize exactly the near-surface strata.

43049134112	PP and PS seismic response from fractured tight gas reservoirs: A case study	In this paper, we present an example of using PP and PS converted-wave data recorded by digital micro-eletro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) to evaluate a fractured tight gas reservoir from the Xinchang gas field in Sichuan, China. For this, we analyse the variations in converted shear-wave splitting, Vp/Vs ratio and PP and PS impedance, as well as other attributes based on absorption and velocity dispersion. The reservoir formation is tight sandstone, buried at a depth of about 5000 m, and the converted-wave data reveal significant shear-wave splitting over the reservoir formation. We utilize a rotation technique to extract the shear-wave polarization and time delay from the data, and a small-window correlation method to build time-delay spectra that allow the generation of a time-delay section. At the reservoir formation, the shear-wave time delay is measured at 20 ms, about 15% shear-wave anisotropy, correlating with the known gas reservoirs. Furthermore, the splitting anomalies are consistent with the characteristics of other attributes such as Vp/Vs ratio and P- and S-wave acoustic and elastic impedance. The P-wave shows consistent low impedance over the reservoir formation, whilst the S-wave impedance shows relatively high impedance. The calculated gas indicator based on absorption and velocity dispersion yields a high correlation with the gas bearing formations. This confirms the benefit of multicomponent seismic data from digital MEMS sensors. © 2008 Nanjing Institute of Geophysical Prospecting.

65949090092	Fractures in sandstone reservoirs with ultra-low permeability: A case study of the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin, China	The Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin, central China, is a typical sandstone reservoir with an ultra-low permeability. High-angle tectonic fractures and diagenetic fractures, such as near-horizontal bedding fractures, intragranular fractures, and grain-boundary fractures, are abundant. Fractures are major pathways and enhance fluid flow in sandstone reservoirs with ultra-low permeability. Because of their weak lateral continuity and their small apertures under lithostatic pressure, bedding fractures make a relatively small contribution to the overall permeability of reservoirs. As they are both of small size and low permeability, intragranular fractures and grain-boundary fractures mainly improve the connectivity of reservoirs by connecting the matrix pores. High-angle tectonic fractures control the fluid movement in the ultra-low-permeability reservoirs. Under the effect of different successive tectonic stress fields, four assemblages of high-angle tectonic fractures developed in the sandstone reservoirs. Under the present-day stress, differently oriented fractures have different connectiv-ities, apertures, and permeabilities. The northeast-southwest fractures parallel to the maximum principal stress have a good connectivity, large apertures, and a high permeability, forming the dominant flow paths. Knowledge of these paths can be used for optimizing well placement. Because of their sensi-tivity to pressure, fractures in different directions will show varying apertures as the formation pressure decreases. Therefore, the permeability of the fractures of different orientations and its impact on reser-voirs vary at different developmental stages. © 2009.

67749137591	Detection of gas reservoirs by the joint use of p- and ps-waves: A case study on the ordos basin, china	We present an example of using converted-waves for characterizing onshore gas reservoirs in the Ordos basin in Northwest China. The Ordos basin is the largest gas province in China. The main gas reservoirs (about 3 300 m in depth) are in upper Paleozoic sandstone that has low or reversed P-wave impedance and is immediately above a coal seam. This makes it very difficult to image the gas reservoirs using conventional P-wave data. Analysis of core, log and VSP data shows a weak PP reflection but a relatively strong PS-converted wave reflection, or both strong PP- and PS-reflections but with opposite polarity from the gas bearing sands, which indicates the potential of using PS-waves to image the gas reservoirs in the Ordos basin. Subsequently, thirteen seismic lines were acquired, processed and interpreted to verify the PP- and PS-responses, and two corresponding attributes (PP- and PS- amplitude ratio and polarity ratio) are used to map the reservoirs through joint PP and PS analysis. © 2009 Seismological Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

77649109203	P-wave attenuation anisotropy in fractured media - Results from a laboratory 'scale-model'	We used a laboratory scale model to study the effects aligned fractures might have on seismic wave propagation at a larger scale in real Earth imaging. Our main objective was to investigate the effects of aligned fractures on seismic wave amplitude through the estimation of fracture-induced attenuation and relating these effects to the fracture properties. The physical model comprised two fracture models constructed from a mixture of epoxy resin and silicon rubber and designed to simulate two sets of intersecting fractures. 2D data were acquired using the pulse-transmission method in three principal directions. The QVO method, an extension of the classical spectral ratio method, was used to estimate the quality factor from the pre-processed data. The results of the study reveal attenuation anisotropy in the modelling data sets. Attenuation was observed to increase systematically away from the fracture strike, with a maximum at the fracture normal. Azimuthal variations in the fracture-induced attenuation were elliptical to a good approximation, enabling fracture orientations to be obtained quite accurately from the axes of the ellipse. We concluded that attenuation anisotropy may be used in fracture characterization to complement the use of travel-times, velocity, amplitude and AVO gradient attributes.

77049114288	Laboratory ultrasonic validation of frequency-dependent seismic anisotropy in synthetic fractured, porous rocks	A combination of synthetic, porous fractured rocks and accurate velocity and attenuation measurements using the ultrasonic pulse-echo system allowed us to test the veracity of the Chapman seismic fracture model. The prediction of frequency-dependent anisotropy is a particular feature of this model which was tested by changing the pore fluid viscosity by two orders of magnitude from water to glycerine. According to the model, frequency effects on velocity and attenuation are analogous to viscosity effects through a squirt flow loss mechanism. Our experimental shear wave splitting results generally show good agreement with these predictions. These results suggest that the Chapman model can be used with confidence for in situ seismic studies of fractured reservoirs. Copyright 2009, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.

77949698620	RBJ for sizable underpass construction in saturated soft soils	The non-excavation technology was adopted for the construction of a six-lane underpass section of Shanghai Middle Ring Project after taking into account the environmental and existing ground conditions. To construct a sizable underpass in saturated soft soil, surface subsidence control is required. The underpass section with shallow overburden of 4.5-5m has a length of 126m, a width of 34.2m and a height of 7.85m. A new method named Pipe Roof-Box Culvert Jacking (RBJ) therefore was proposed for the building of the underpass structure. The pipe roof was composed of 80 pieces of (p970mm pipes and constructed by slurry pipe jacking method. This worked like a guide tunnel, whereas the box culvert jacking was constructed inside the pipe roof structure. This new method has advantages of being reliable and cost effective. This paper elaborates the key technologies and the main procedures involving this new method. The mechanism and result of the method is discussed based on the data of site instrumentation. This paper could be used as a reference for both construction and design of similar projects in future.

77953076530	Reservoir fluid substitution effects on seismic profile interpretation: A physical modeling experiment	P-wave seismic surveys are performed on realistic physical models of a reservoir formed of interbedded sand and shale layers and filled with gas, water, and oil. They show characteristic behaviour which can be used to distinguish between fluids, with significant implications for the interpretation of time-lapse experiments. Discontinuous reflections originate in gas-filled reservoirs, with widely varying amplitude compared to oil-or water-filled reservoirs. Anomalous changes in seismic amplitude difference attributes for reflections within the reservoir are seen for gas/oil substitution. Oil/water substitution results in only weak variations of reservoir elastic properties, thus amplitude difference attributes may be unsuitable for monitoring changes in oil/water saturation. However, direct differences between the time traces are strong. On time-lapse sections, strong amplitude difference anomalies do not necessarily correspond to the region where the fluid variations occur; this is significant for monitoring oil field development by water injection.

78149457989	A practical approach to compensate for diodic effects of PS converted waves	We have proposed a practical approach to compensate for the diodic moveout of PS converted waves using a velocity perturbation method. GUI-based methods have been developed to perform the diodic velocity analysis for stacking and prestack time migration, and command line methods to perform the diodic moveout correction and prestack time migration with diodic moveout compensation. In this method, the diodic moveout is decoupled into two parts. One part is related to the base velocity and the other is related to the velocity perturbation. The base velocity is used to correct the curved feature of the diodic moveout and the velocity perturbation is used to correct the dipping feature of the diodic moveout. Application of this approach to a real data set has shown that we can easily estimate the base velocity and the velocity perturbation. The events in negative and positive offset data can be easily aligned, and the quality of both the final stacked image and migrated image improved. © 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

78249249971	Depth migration and model building in HTI media using an equivalent VTI approach	Wide- and multi-azimuth seismic data acquisition has become popular in the hydrocarbon industry. However, the presence of azimuthal anisotropy in the subsurface can severely affect the wide-azimuth data, and how to account for azimuthal anisotropy during the processing of wide- and multi-azimuth data remains a challenge. Here, assuming weakly horizontal transverse isotropy (HTI), we present a simplified approach to fill this gap. Under the weak anisotropy assumption, we can use an equivalent VTI medium to model a fixed azimuth of a HTI medium for P-wave propagation. Therefore, we may use the VTI algorithms for migration and depth model building in HTI medium. The anisotropic parameters of the HTI medium can also be inverted from the equivalent VTI parameters of two orthogonal azimuthal planes. © 2010, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.

78249258387	An integrated study of fracture detection using p-wave seismic data	We present an integrated study of fracture detection by analyzing the seismic anisotropy in the 3D P-wave seismic data from Caidamu Basin in Northwest China. The study area lies on a big anticline which runs from southeast to northwest with the area around 400 km2, and each flank of the anticline develops a reverse fault. The target layer is a fractured gas reservoir at a depth of around 3 km just under the anticline. We first study the fracture characteristics from outcrop analogues, core samples and well logs. We then analyze the coherence and curvature attributes from post-stack seismic data, and azimuthal variation of amplitude and traveltime from pre-stack seismic data. After a careful and integrated analysis, we find that fractures are widespread and regularly distributed in the middle of study area along the anticline strike, and form good pathways and store space for fluid. The final results estimated using azimuthal analysis of pre-stack seismic amplitude data are consistent with results of core and log analysis at the well locations, which extended our knowledge of the fracture distribution in the reservoir. © 2010, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.

78249266599	Physical modelling studies of the effect of fracture thickness on P-wave attenuation	The seismic physical approach was used to investigate the effect of fracture thickness on P-wave attenuation, using a laboratory-scale model of two horizontal layers. The first layer is isotropic while the second layer has six fractured blocks, each consisting of thin penny-shaped chips of 3mm fixed diameter and same thickness to simulate a suite of aligned vertical fractures. The chips thicknesses vary according to the blocks while the fracture density remains the same in each block. 2D data were acquired with the physical model submerged in a water tank in a direction normal to the fracture strikes using the pulse-transmission method. The seismic quality factor, Q was estimated from the pre-processed CMP gathers using the QVO method, which is an extension of the spectral ratio method of measuring attenuation. The results of our measurements show a direct relationship between attenuation and fracture thickness. The induced attenuation was observed to increase systematically with fracture thickness, implying more scattering of the wave energy in the direction of increasing thickness. This information may be useful to differentiate the effect caused by thin micro cracks from that of large open fractures. © 2010, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.

78650036696	Observations of fluid-dependent shear-wave splitting in synthetic porous rocks with aligned penny-shaped fractures	P- and S-wave velocity and attenuation coefficients (accurate to ±0.3% and ±0.2 dB/cm, respectively) were measured in synthetic porous rocks with aligned, penny-shaped fractures using the laboratory ultrasonic pulse-echo method. Shear-wave splitting was observed by rotating the S-wave transducer and noting the maximum and minimum velocities relative to the fracture direction. A block of synthetic porous rock of fracture density 0.0201 ± 0.0068 and fracture size 3.6 ± 0.38 mm (measured from image analysis of X-ray CT scans) was sub-sampled into three 20-30 mm long, 50 mm diameter core plugs oriented at 0°, 45° and 90° to the fracture normal (transversely isotropic symmetry axis). Full waveform data were collected over the frequency range 500-1000 kHz for both water and glycerin saturated cores to observe the effect of pore fluid viscosity at 1 cP and 100 cP, respectively. The shear-wave splitting observed in the 90° core was 2.15 ± 0.02% for water saturated and 2.39 ± 0.02% for glycerin saturated, in agreement with the theory that suggests that the percentage splitting should be 100 times the fracture density and independent of the saturating fluid. In the 45° core, by contrast, splitting was 0.00 ± 0.02% for water saturation and -0.77 ± 0.02% for glycerin saturation. This dependence on fracture orientation and pore fluid viscosity is consistent with the poro-visco-elastic theory for aligned, meso-scale fractures in porous rocks. The results suggest the possible use of shear- or converted-wave data to discriminate between fluids on the basis of viscosity variations. © 2010 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.

79957965652	Seismic reservoir characterization: How can multicomponent data help?	This paper discusses the concepts of multicomponent seismology and how it can be applied to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs, illustrated using a 3D three-component real-data example from southwest China. Hydrocarbon reservoirs formed from subtle lithological changes, such as stratigraphic traps, may be delineated from changes in P- and S-wave velocities and impedances, whilst hydrocarbon reservoirs containing aligned fractures are anisotropic. Examination of the resultant split shear waves can give us a better definition of their internal structures. Furthermore, frequency-dependent variations in seismic attributes derived from multicomponent data can provide us with vital information about fluid type and distribution. Current practice and various examples have demonstrated the undoubted potential of multicomponent seismic in reservoir characterization. Despite all this, there are still substantial challenges ahead. In particular, the improvement and interpretation of converted-wave imaging are major hurdles that need to be overcome before multicomponent seismic becomes a mainstream technology. © 2011 Nanjing Geophysical Research Institute.

The physical model consists of three layers. The first layer is made of epoxy resin, and the third layer is made of mixed material. Both of them are isotropic layers. The second layer is a bakelite layer, simulating HTI media with aligned vertical fracture. 2D data of three lines from different directions were acquired using the pulse-transmission method with the physical model submerged in a water tank. The pre-stack CDP gathers have been used to calculate Q of target zone by the method QVO (Q versus offset) based on the classical spectral ratio theory. According to the experiment analysis, Q of vertical fractured layer changes versus azimuth, where the biggest of Q value appears in the direction parallel to the fracture orientation and the smallest in the normal direction to the fracture orientation. This would be helpful for the fracture orientation detection.

We model a common shot reflection survey over anisotropic viscoelastic reservoirs and the reservoirs' structure, anisotropy and attenuation considerably affect the seismic responses. For visco-fluid saturated reservoirs the modeling results show that the converted and reflected S-wave has a reasonable strength, but the energy of the reflected P-wave from the interface below the reservoir is too weak to be detected. The seismic response of a Q interface is also analyzed, where the impedance contrast is very weak but the contrast in attenuation is significant.

We devised a new measurement RĨ to estimate the ray impedance from elastic impedance derived by existing techniques. The recovered RĨ was expressed in the form of a normalization of EI. It solved the range variability problem of EI and had the same interpretation capability as RI. In addition, reflection coefficients represented by RĨ showed good agreement with the Zeoppritz equation even at postcritical angle of incidence. Tests of these three attributes (RI, RĨ, and EI) were performed on the log data of three different types of reservoir: a typical Class III marine gas-sand, a Class I tight gas-sand, and a Class II oil-bearing sand in thin sand-mud interbedded layers. Although the crossplots of EI against acoustic impedance (AI) showed visually similar characteristics for a gas-sand as that of RI, based on the linear/quadratic discrimination analysis, RI appeared to be more applicable than EI for characterizing gas sands, especially tight gas sands. RĨ, estimated from EI, had a comparable value range to the AI, and retained the interpretation ability of the original RI. Application on real seismic data showed that existing EI inversion results could be improved straightforwardly by means of the introduced transformation. © 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

84864401565	The analysis of frequency-dependent characteristics for fluid detection: A physical model experiment	According to the Chapman multi-scale rock physical model, the seismic response characteristics vary for different fluid-saturated reservoirs. For class I AVO reservoirs and gas-saturation, the seismic response is a high-frequency bright spot as the amplitude energy shifts. However, it is a low-frequency shadow for the Class III AVO reservoirs saturated with hydrocarbons. In this paper, we verified the high-frequency bright spot results of Chapman for the Class I AVO response using the frequency-dependent analysis of a physical model dataset. The physical model is designed as inter-bedded thin sand and shale based on real field geology parameters. We observed two datasets using fixed offset and 2D geometry with different fluidsaturated conditions. Spectral and time-frequency analyses methods are applied to the seismic datasets to describe the response characteristics for gas-, water-, and oil-saturation. The results of physical model dataset processing and analysis indicate that reflection wave tuning and fluid-related dispersion are the main seismic response characteristic mechanisms. Additionally, the gas saturation model can be distinguished from water and oil saturation for Class I AVO utilizing the frequency-dependent abnormal characteristic. The frequency-dependent characteristic analysis of the physical model dataset verified the different spectral response characteristics corresponding to the different fluid-saturated models. Therefore, by careful analysis of real field seismic data, we can obtain the abnormal spectral characteristics induced by the fluid variation and implement fluid detection using seismic data directly. © 2012 Editorial Office of Applied Geophysics and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84869138911	Gas reservoir detection based on local frequency attributes	As time function of seismic wave propagation in subsurface, seismic trace is the response characteristic of reflection signal from the layers. Complex seismic trace analysis method is based on the Hilbert transform of the seismic signal, from which instantaneous amplitude, instantaneous phase and instantaneous frequency can be calculated. Three instantaneous attribute parameters play an important role in reservoir prediction and characterization. However, the frequency-dependent characteristic induced by the existed hydrocarbon in reservoir porous medium couldn't be found in the instantaneous frequency attribute section. The main reason is the lower resolution and complicate interpretation resulted from the phase shift effect on the computing process. In this paper, the conventional instantaneous frequency calculation method is reviewed and a novel local attribute technique is introduced into the local frequency attribute calculating method. The application of real field seismic datasets for hydrocarbon detecting in gas reservoir area indicates that the local frequency attribute can show the frequency-dependent response with the fluid in reservoir with higher signal-to-noise ratio and interpretation ability. Moreover, the integrated interpretation combined with the converted-wave seismic attribute can improve the ability of reservoir prediction and qualitative fluid detecting.

Our results reveal that there is an offset limitation for both PP- and PS-waves in elliptical anisotropy fitting, and that PS-waves show a wider applicable offset range and larger observable azimuthal anisotropy than PP-waves. The major axis of the elliptical fit to the amplitudes of the R-component is perpendicular to the fracture strike, which is opposite to that in PP-wave analysis. The azimuthal interval travel time of PS-waves shows a nearly elliptical distribution and the major axis of the fit ellipse is perpendicular to the fracture strike, which is same as that in PP-wave analysis. For data within the applicable offset range, the anisotropic magnitude obtained from amplitude and travel time attributes of PP- and PS-waves exhibits a dependence on fracture density, and the major to minor axis ratio of the fit ellipse may be used to infer the relative distribution of fracture densities. © 2012 Editorial Office of Applied Geophysics and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Using the core and well log data from the Barnett Shale, we demonstrate the application of the constructed templates for the evaluation of porosity, lithology and brittleness index. Then, we investigate the brittleness index defined in terms of mineralogy and geomechanical properties. The results show that as clay content increases, Poisson's ratio tends to increase and Young's modulus tends to decrease. Moreover, we find that Poisson's ratio is more sensitive to the variation in the texture of shales resulting from the preferred orientation of clay particles. Finally, based on the constructed rock physics model, we calculate AVO responses from the top and bottom of the Barnett Shale, and the results indicate predictable trends for the variations in porosity, lithology and brittleness index in shales. © 2013 Sinopec Geophysical Research Institute.

84877652877	Converted-wave imaging based on the diodic moveout in a land gas-cloud area	Gas cloud is widely distributed in Sanhu area, Qaidam Basin. Converted-waves (C-waves) are effective to imaging through it which degrades P wave imaging. In this paper, we model a gas cloud within the Sebei Field using the pseudo-spectral method to study the diodic effect. When the model data is processed and analyzed, we can find the significant diodic effects. It may be compensated by using a velocity perturbation method which decouples the diodic moveout into two parts: the base velocity and the velocity perturbation. The converted wave imaging is improved by the application of diodic moveout. The same work flow is applied to the real 3C-2D data from Sebei Field. We obtain almost the same result as on the synthetic data.

84878808555	A new microseismic location method accounting for the influence of the hydraulic fracturing process	In the hydraulic fracturing process, the velocity model of traditional inversion is usually constructed by well logs, seismic data or calibration shots. The variation of pore pressure and fractures in this process has a major influence on the velocity. However, this influence is usually ignored in the velocity estimation model. In this paper, we propose a new microseismic location method that accounts for the influence of hydraulic fracturing on velocity. Firstly, we simulate the 3D hydraulic fracturing process based on mass conservation, the seepage equation and fracture mechanics. Then the equivalent velocity model is constructed using the Coates-Schoenberg method and fracture compliances. The 3D ray-tracing method is applied to forward-model the microseismic data and traditional inversion methods are applied to locate events and analyse the inversion error. Finally, we introduce a new method, called the equivalent velocity inversion method (EVIM), taking into account the influence of the fracturing process. The simulation results show that the hydraulic fracturing process affects the velocity and thus makes the inversion accuracy of the same receiver array vary considerably with the sources in the traditional methods. The new EVIM can effectively reduce the inversion error. © 2013 Sinopec Geophysical Research Institute.

84879739170	Study of S-wave ray elastic impedance for identifying lithology and fluid	In this paper, we derive an approximation of the SS-wave reflection coefficient and the expression of S-wave ray elastic impedance (SREI) in terms of the ray parameter. The SREI can be expressed by the S-wave incidence angle or P-wave reflection angle, referred to as SREIS and SREIP, respectively. Our study using elastic models derived from real log measurements shows that SREIP has better capability for lithology and fluid discrimination than SREIS and conventional S-wave elastic impedance (SEI). We evaluate the SREIP feasibility using 25 groups of samples from Castagna and Smith (1994). Each sample group is constructed by using shale, brine-sand, and gas-sand. Theoretical evaluation also indicates that SREIP at large incident angles is more sensitive to fluid than conventional fluid indicators. Real seismic data application also shows that SREIP at large angles calculated using P-wave and S-wave impedance can efficiently characterize tight gas-sand. © 2013 Editorial Office of Applied Geophysics and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878962691	P-wave attenuation anisotropy in fractured media: A seismic physical modelling study	We used a laboratory scale model to study the effects aligned fractures might have on seismic wave propagation at a larger scale in real Earth imaging. Our main objective was to investigate the effect of aligned fractures on seismic P-wave amplitude through the estimation of the induced attenuation. The physical model was constructed from a mixture of epoxy resin and silicon rubber, with inclusions designed to simulate two sets of inclined fractures at an angle of 29.2° with each other. Two-dimensional reflection data were acquired using the pulse and transmission method in three principal directions relative to the fracture strike azimuth with the model submerged in a water tank. We used the Quality Versus Offset (QVO) method, an extension of the classical spectral ratio method for determining attenuation to estimate the induced attenuation (inverse of the seismic quality factor) from the Common Mid Point (CMP) pre-processed gathers. The results of our analysis show that the induced P-wave attenuation is anisotropic, with elliptical (cos2θ) variations with respect to the survey azimuth angle θ. The minor axis of the Q ellipse corresponds to the fracture normal. In this direction, i.e. across the material grain, the attenuation is a maximum. The major axis corresponds to the fracture strike direction (parallel to the material grain) where minimum attenuation occurs. These attenuation results show consistency with the azimuthal anisotropy observed in the stacking velocities in the fractured-layer and are all consistent with the physical model, and thus provide a physical basis for using attenuation anisotropy to derive fracture properties from seismic data. © 2012 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.

84880241834	Prediction of coal permeability using dimension analysis and multiple regression	An experimental study shows that a critical effective stress value exists, and coal permeability does not increase or decrease monotonously with temperature increase as previous researchers had thought. When effective stress is more than this value, coal permeability decreases as temperature rises; when effective stress is less than this value, the opposite law will appear. Also, based on dimension analysis and multiple regression, combining experimental data analysis, this study develops a coal permeability model, which has high accuracy. Using this study's method, a similar permeability model suitable for other target zones can be established. So this study provides a theoretical basis for coal permeability prediction. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

84886832316	Development and application of unconventional oil & gas well fracturing optimization design software based on fracture network interference model	Based on compound fracture mechanics and energy balance principle, and considering the high brittleness and low permeability of the rock in the unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, the mechanical mechanism of crack propagation under the mutual stress interference between induced fracture of staged fracturing for horizontal wells and the transport regularity of variable density proppant in fractures were studied. Taking into account the forms of the network cracks respectively in the network fracturing of single horizontal well and the sync-fracturing of twin wells, a volume optimal design model of the induced reticular fracture was built considering the mutual stress interference between induced fractures. Meanwhile, the 3D-UGMulti-Fracture software was developed with the Visual Studio 2012 development platform, according to the both simulated three-dimensional model of crack extension of the hydraulic fracture and the full three-dimensional model of the two dimensional flows along the crack length and height. The transport process of variable density proppant in the network fracture was studied on the basis of fracture mechanics and fluid mechanics. The fracturing process was monitored by the micro-seismic technology, and it was found that the calculated results via the developed software agree well with the test results. According to the design requirements, the parameters such as liquid discharge and sand ratio are optimized. The effective support length increases and flow capacity of the features is improved.
