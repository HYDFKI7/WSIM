8544273712	Novel fluoro- and hydroxyl-containing jasmonate derivatives as highly efficient elicitors in suspension cultures of Taxus chinensis	Some of jasmonate derivatives with fluoro- or hydroxyl groups on their ester parts are found to be novel and effective elicitors, which enhanced the production of taxuyunnanine C (Tc) up to 60% more than that by methyl jasmonate in Taxus chinensis cell cultures. To develop more effective abiotic elicitors for cell suspension cultures of T. chinensis to meet the needs for paclitaxel as anti-tumor drug, some fluoro- or hydroxyl-containing groups are introduced to the ester moiety of jasmonic acid by the esterification or acylation with bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate and corresponding alcohol. Some of them are found to be novel and effective elicitors, which can enhance the production of taxuyunnanine C (Tc) up to 60% more than that by methyl jasmonate (MJA) in T. chinensis cell cultures. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The substituents at the aroyloxyl moiety have an important and unusual influence on the DNA photocleavage, and DNA photodamages of the compounds were unusually not depended on the electronic effects of substituents on the corresponding oxygen-centered radicals. With AM1 semi-empirical quantum calculation, it was found that their photocleaving activities were correlated with the densities of electron clouds on the N-O bonds in the triplet state. N-(m-Dichloro-benzoyloxy) -thioxo-naphthalimide could photodamage DNA effectively at less than the concentration of 2μM. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

23944476412	A novel synthetic fluoro-containing jasmonate derivative acts as a chemical inducing signal for plant secondary metabolism	A novel fluoro-containing jasmonate derivative was chemically synthesized and evaluated as a potential elicitor with respect to the induction of plant defense responses and the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites. A bioactive taxuyunnanine C (Tc)-producing cell line of Taxus chinensis was taken as a model plant cell system. The presence of novel synthesized pentafluoropropyl jasmonate (PFPJA) induced two early and important events in plant defense responses, including an oxidative burst and activation of l-phenylalanine ammonia lyase. In addition, PFPJA was found to significantly increase Tc accumulation, without any inhibition of cell growth. Moreover, Tc accumulation was increased more in the presence of PFPJA compared with methyl jasmonate (MJA) and previously reported trifluoroethyl jasmonate (TFEJA). For example, addition of 100 μM PFPJA on day 7 led to a high Tc content (38.2±0.3 mg/g) at day 21, while the Tc content was 29.3±0.3 mg/g and 34.9±0.9 mg/g with the addition of 100 μM MJA and TFEJA, respectively. Quantitative structure-activity analysis of fluoro-containing jasmonates suggests that the increase in the fluoro-groups introduced into the carboxyl side-chain of MJA resulted in a higher stimulatory activity for Tc biosynthesis, which corresponds well with the markedly increased lipophilicity after fluorine introduction. These results indicate that newly synthesized fluoro-containing PFPJA can act as a powerful chemical inducing signal for secondary metabolism in plant cell cultures. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

2542442514	Novel synthetic jasmonates as highly efficient elicitors for taxoid production by suspension cultures of Taxus chinensis	Suspension cultures of Taxus chinensis were used as a model plant cell system to evaluate novel synthetic jasmonates as elicitors for stimulating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Significant increases in accumulation of taxuyunnanine C (Tc) were observed in the presence of newly synthesized 2-hydroxyethyl jasmonate (HEJA) and trifluoroethyl jasmonate (TFEJA) without their inhibition on cell growth. Addition of 100 μM HEJA or TFEJA on day 7 led to a high Tc content of 44.3 ± 1.1mg/g or 39.7 ± 1.1 mg/g (at day 21), while the Tc content was 14.0 ± 0.1 mg/g and 32.4 ± 1.6 mg/g for the control and that with addition of 100 μM methyl jasmonate (MJA), respectively. The superior stimulating ability of HEJA and TFEJA over MJA, which was generally considered as the best chemical for eliciting taxoid biosynthesis, suggests that the novel jasmonate analogues may have great potential in application to other cell culture systems for efficient elicitation of plant secondary metabolites. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2942590489	Novel chemically synthesized hydroxyl-containing jasmonates as powerful inducing signals for plant secondary metabolism	Novel hydroxyl-containing jasmonate derivatives were chemically synthesized and evaluated by bioassay as potential elicitors for stimulating the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites. A suspension culture of Taxus chinensis, which produces a bioactive taxoid, taxuyunnanine C (Tc), was taken as a model plant cell system. Experiments on the timing of addition of jasmonates and dose response indicated that day 7 and 100 μM was the optimal elicitation time and concentration, respectively, for both cell growth and Tc accumulation. Tc accumulation was increased more in the presence of novel hydroxylcontaining jasmonates compared to that with methyljasmonate (MJA) addition. For example, addition of 100 μM 2,3-dihydroxypropyl jasmonate on day 7 led to a very high Tc content of 47.2 ± 0.5 mg/g (at day 21), whereas the Tc content was 29.2 ± 0.6 mg/g (on the same day) with addition of 100 μM MJA. Quantitative structure-activity analysis of various jasmonates suggests that the optimal lipophilicity and the number of hydroxyl groups may be two important factors affecting their elicitation activity. In addition, the jasmonate elicitors were found to induce plant defense responses, including oxidative burst and activation of L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Interestingly, a higher level of H

The dose response and timing of HEJA elicitation were investigated in cell suspension cultures of Panax notoginseng. The optimal concentration and timing of HEJA addition for both cell growth and ginsenoside accumulation was identified to be 200 μm added on day 4. It was interestingly found that HEJA could stimulate ginsenosides biosynthesis and change their heterogeneity more efficiently than methyl jasmonate (MJA), i.e., the total ginsenoside content and the Rb/Rg ratio increased about 60 and 30% with HEJA elicitation than that by MJA, respectively.

To provide an insight into the elicitation mechanism of the newly synthesized elicitors, by taking 2-hydroxyethyl jasmonate (HEJ, at 100 μM) as a typical example, in this work the defense signals were detected and their influences on the expression of important genes in taxoid biosynthetic pathway were examined in cell cultures of T. chinensis.

New synthetic elicitors that showed powerful eliciting activities upon taxoid biosynthesis by Taxus chinensis suspension cells were obtained. For example, benzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid 2-(2-hydroxybenzoxyl)ethyl ester was more effective and resulted in nearly 40% increase in taxuyunnanine C content and production in comparison with methyl jasmonate, which was previously reported as the most powerful chemical elicitor for taxoid biosynthesis.

Although they were synthesized from the same matrix, nitrosubstituted acenaphtho[1,2-b]quinoxaline, these compounds exhibited quite different fluorescence changes when they were differently nitrosubstituted. Their evaluation for imaging tumor hypoxia was carried out in V79 cells in vitro by Fluorescence Microplate Reader. After 3.5 h, the hypoxic-oxic fluorescence differential incubated with A1, A4, and A5 in V79 cells could reach 6, 9, and 11 times differential fluorescence between oxic and hypoxic cells separately, which are suitable for further evaluation as probes for hypoxic cells in tumors in vivo. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

80052306413	B1-induced caspase-independent apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is mediated by down-regulation of Bcl-2 via p53 binding to P2 promoter TATA box	The Bcl-2 family contains a panel of proteins which are conserved regulators of apoptosis in mammalian cells, like the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. According to its significant role in altering susceptibility to apoptosis, the deciphering of the mechanism of Bcl-2 expression modulation may be crucial for identifying therapeutics strategies for cancer. Treatment with naphthalimide-based DNA intercalators, including M2-A and R16, generally leads to a decrease in Bcl-2 intracellular amounts. Whereas the interest for these chemotherapeutics is accompanied by advances in the fundamental understanding of their anticancer properties, the molecular mechanism underlying changes in Bcl-2 expression remains poorly understood. We report here that p53 contributes to Bcl-2 down-regulation induced by B1, a novel naphthalimide-based DNA intercalating agent. Indeed, the decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels observed during B1-induced apoptosis was correlated to the decrease in mRNA levels, as a result of the inhibition of Bcl-2 transcription and promoter activity. In this context, we evaluated p53 contribution in the Bcl-2 transcriptional down-regulation. We found a significant increase of p53 binding to P

84861730979	Short and scalable synthesis of an anhydride precursor of the environment-sensitive fluorophore 6-dimethylaminonaphthalimide	Environment-sensitive fluorophores have different quantum yields in different solvents. 6-Dimethylaminonaphthalimide (6-DMN), for example, has a low quantum yield in aqueous solutions, but is highly fluorescent in nonpolar solvents or when bound to hydrophobic sites in proteins or membranes. 6-DMN has been used to investigate protein-protein interactions, as well as the in-tissue distribution and internalization of δ-receptors. This protocol describes a highly efficient three-stage synthesis of 6-dimethylamino-2,3- naphthalenedicarboxylic anhydride (compound 1), which is a stable precursor that can be converted to 6-DMN. The three stages are (i) photo-bromination of 4-nitro-o-xylene (yield 82%), (ii) Diels-Alder reaction followed by base hydrolysis, resulting in 6-nitro-2,3-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (yield 87%) and (iii) reductive amination followed by dehydration (yield 76.5%) to form compound 1. The synthesis can be performed on a gram scale (in 55 h over 3 d) with an overall yield of about 55%. It can easily be modified to prepare related compounds by, for example, performing different reactions using 6-nitro-2,3-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

Kyoho cell suspension cultures by 2, 3-dihydroxypropyl jasmonate elicitation	Background: Plant cell suspension culture of Vitis vinifera is a promising technology for investigating different factors that are able to induce and/or modify stilbenes biosynthesis. Jasmonates have been reported to play an important role in a signal transduction pathway that regulates defence responses as well as the production of secondary metabolites. In this study, 2, 3-dihydroxypropyl jasmonate (DHPJA) was used to investigate its effect on stimulating trans-resveratrol (t-R) accumulation and the plant defence responses in Vitis vinifera cv. Kyoho cell suspension cultures for the first time. Results: It demonstrated that DHPJA had superior effects on stilbenoids accumulation over methyl jasmonate (MeJA). The optimal condition was 150 μM DHPJA added on day 15 of cultivation period, with the highest level of t-R accumulation which was increased 1.8-fold and 1.3-fold compared with the control and 150 μM MeJA respectively. DHPJA induced stronger plant defence responses, including oxidative burst and activation of L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) than MeJA. H

Further investigations on Hela cells revealed that 7c could also induce ROS generation, lysosome rupture as well as cathepsin B release. Subsequent mitochondrial damages including mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the release of cytochrome c were also found in 7c when treating with Hela cells.

84907923910	Selective and ratiometric fluorescent trapping and quantification of protein vicinal dithiols and in situ dynamic tracing in living cells	Protein vicinal dithiols play fundamental roles in intracellular redox homeostasis due to their involvement in protein synthesis and function through the reversible vicinal dithiol oxidation to disulfide. To provide quantitative information about the global distribution and dynamic changes of protein vicinal dithiols in living cells, we have designed and synthesized a ratiometric fluorescent probe (VTAF) for trapping of vicinal dithiol-containing proteins (VDPs) in living cells. VTAF exhibits a ratiometric fluorescence signal upon single excitation, which enables self-calibration of the fluorescence signal and quantification of endogenous vicinal dithiols of VDPs. Its potential for in situ dynamic tracing of changes of protein vicinal dithiols under different cellular redox conditions was exemplified. VTAF facilitated the direct observation of subcellular distribution of endogenous VDPs via ratiometric fluorescence imaging and colocalization assay. And the results suggested that there are abundant VDPs in mitochondria. Moreover, some redox-sensitive VDPs are also present on cell surface which can respond to redox stimulus. This ratiometric fluorescence technique presents an important extension to previous fluorescence intensity-based probes for trapping and quantifying protein vicinal dithiols in living cells, as well as its visible dynamic tracing of VDPs.

Initial DNA interaction studies (by the fluorescence quenching method, UV/vis and CD spectroscopy, thermal denaturation, topoisomerase Western blot analysis, and DNA photocleavage experiments) expectedly suggested the DNA and topoisomerase as main targets of the agents. Fluorescence spectroscopic and microscopic experiments indicated a significant sensitivity of the emission intensities of 3 and 5 to the cellular environment and confirmed the cellular uptake and biodistribution into cell compartments for 1-3 and 5. A comparative evaluation of the antiproliferative effects under different experimental setups (concerning drug exposure period and an additional short-time UV irradiation) revealed significant phototoxic effects for the environmentally sensitive compounds 3 and 5 and strongly suggested the further development of sulfur-substituted naphthalimides for potential use in photodynamic tumor therapy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

CS1 was based on the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism, while CS2 was founded on the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. The photophysical properties of CS1-2 in anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution were studied by fluorescence and UV-vis methods. The experimental results show that significant absorption and emission spectral responses of CS1 were observed with the addition of SDS: the absorbance and fluorescence intensity decreased first and then increased. The plot of fluorescence intensity of CS1 versus SDS concentration showed two break points, which might be ascribed to the critical micellar concentration (cmc) and the formation of premicelle (cac) aggregate, respectively. But the solution's color of CS2 changed from yellow to red with increasing SDS concentrations. The large red-shift in both absorption (50 nm) and emission (55 nm) spectra of CS2 was resulted from the protonation of the electron accepting moiety (N{double bond, long}C nitrogen), which enhanced the "push-pull" interaction of the ICT fluorophore.

Upon addition of Cys, the emission of 1 was enhanced with about 25 nm red-shift in the emission maximum (from 455 to 480 nm), accompanied with the fluorescent color change from blue to cyan, which was attributed to the reaction of the aldehyde groups in 1 with cysteine to form very stable thiazolidines derivative.

77956031472	"Alive" dyes as fluorescent sensors: Fluorophore, mechanism, receptor and images in living cells	In this feature article, we report our recent progresses in fluorescent sensors of biological dyes from the viewpoint of supramolecular and bioorganic chemistry. For signalling fluorophores, we extended or created naphthalene-based ICT systems, e.g. amino-1,8-naphthalimides, amino-1,8-dicyanonaphthalenes and acenaphthopyrrol-9-carbonitriles. We also developed BODIPY derivatives with large Stokes shifts and high fluorescence quantum yields in polar solvents, and a rhodamine analogue working in strong competitive aqueous solution as well as its silaanthracene analogue with a bathochromic shift as large as 90 nm. For sensing mechanisms, we extended or developed the following methods to improve sensing: e.g. PET in a photogenerated electronic field, TICT promoted PET derived from aminoalkyl or piperazino aminonaphthalimides, and the translation/amplification effect of surfactant micelles or aggregation on fluorescent sensing. We also successfully designed deprotonation strengthened ICT, FRET-chemodosimeter sensing systems. For non-cyclic recognition receptors, naphthalimides with two or more side chains at their 4,5- or 3,4-positions, as a convenient and simple platform for ratiometric sensors, were created for the recognition of heavy and transition metallic cations; multi-armed polyamides with more side chains were innovated as a versatile platform for the sensing of metal ions with high affinity, selectivity and positive homotropic allosteric effects. We designed V-shape sensors of the bis(aminomethyl)pyridine receptor with two fluorophores to show high performance. Finally, the intracellular applications of the above sensors and dyes, e.g. imaging heavy and transition metal ions in cells, fluorescent marking of hypoxia of tumour cells, are also reviewed. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Based on 6-amino-2,3-naphthalimide (6-ANP) compound, a new type of fluorophore was found to exhibit moderate to unusual large Stokes shift (297-303 nm). 6-ANP derivatives display relatively low fluorescence quantum yields in high polar protic solvents such as water (Φ

78650486142	B1, a novel amonafide analogue, overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells	In the course of screening for novel anticancer compounds, B1 [N-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-2-aminothiazonaphthalimide], a novel amonafide analogue, was generated as a new anticancer candidate. In the present study, B1 displayed stronger antitumor effects than amonafide in HL60 cells. We further examined whether B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2, as overcoming the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer. Our viability assay showed that B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. Various apoptosis assessment assays showed that B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in HL60 cells by inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, we elucidated the marked downregulation of 14-3-3δ protein by B1, indicating that B1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in HL60 cells via 14-3-3δ. The analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that MBD2 was associated with the methylated 14-3-3δ promoter-associated CpG island and thus interfered with transcriptional activity of the methylated promoter. Furthermore, knockdown of MBD2, using siRNA transfection, inhibited B1-induced apoptosis and overcame the resistance conferred by Bcl-2. Accordingly, these data showed the involvement of MBD2 in B1-induced apoptosis and overcoming the resistance conferred by Bcl-2, which suggested that MBD2 might guide the development of future anticancer agents. ©2010 American Association for Cancer Research. ©2010 AACR.

79953672783	Experimental study on oxymatrine inducing apoptosis of human carcinoma cells MGC-803 in Vivo and in Vitro	OBJECTIVE: To explore effect of oxymatrine on MGC-803 cell apoptosis and its possible mechanism in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Apoptosis rate and the expression level of Bcl-2 and Bax were determined with flow cytometry. Subcutaneous transplantation tumor cell apoptosis was observed in nude mouse with TUNEL. RESULTS: The study in vivo and in vitro indicated that oxymatrine promoted MGC-803 cell apoptosis. The index of apoptosis was significantly different (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. The expression of Bcl-2 was reduced and the expression of Bax was increased remarkably (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oxymatrine can induce MGC-803 cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism was related to up-regulating expression of Bax and down-regulating expression of Bcl-2.

79954597853	7-b, a novel amonafide analogue, cause growth inhibition and apoptosis in Raji cells via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway	Previous studies have shown that 7-b (6-(dodecylamino)-2-(3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl)-1H-benzo-[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione), a novel amonafide-based DNA intercalator, was generated as a new anticancer candidate. However, the effects induced by 7-b and the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood in Burkitt's lymphoma. To shed light on these issues, we have investigated the effects of 7-b on proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis activity and oxidative stress levels of lymphoma Raji cells in vitro. Our results showed that 7-b inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells and induced G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, 7-b treatment triggered programmed cell death, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Altogether our results showed that 7-b mediated its growth inhibitory effects on Raji cells via the activation of a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway and cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathway which subsequently targeted p21. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

0036738710	Synthesis and properties of oligonucleotides containing fluorescent ethenodeoxyadenosine and ethenodeoxycytidine	Fluorescent ethenodeoxyadenosine (dA′) or/and ethenodeoxycytidine (dC′) were site-specifically inserted into four oligonucleotides through phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated DNA synthesizer, their nucleoside compositions were confirmed by enzymatic digestion analysis. The UV melting behaviors indicate that the conformation of modified duplex is not affected when incorporated into modified nucleosides. The introduction of dA′ to the oligonucleotide slightly increases the duplex stability relative to the corresponding unmodified oligonucleotide while the introduction of dC′ slightly decreases the duplex stability. Fluorescence is greatly quenched when dA′ or dC′ is inserted into an oligonucleotide and quenched further when the dA′ or dC′-modified oligonucleotide binds with its complementary DNA. The fluorescence intensity of an oligonucleotide can be increased by inserted two or more molecules of dA′. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In silico target prediction revealed that tyrosine kinases might be the potential targets of the representative compound 2, which was subsequently validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for its selective and active FGFR1 inhibition of various tyrosine kinases. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis aided by molecular docking simulation in the ATP-binding site demonstrated that acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole carboxylic acid esters (2-5) are potent inhibitors of FGFR1 with IC50 values ranging from 19 to 77 nM. Furthermore, these compounds exhibited favorable growth inhibition property against FGFR-expressing cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from micromolar to submicromolar. Western blotting analysis showed that compounds 2, 3, and 2b inhibited activation of FGFR1 and extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2). © 2011 American Chemical Society.

Prospective case study in the discovery of diverse p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase 2 inhibitors to suppress cell migration	We described a prospective application of ligand-based virtual screening program SHAFTS to discover novel inhibitors for p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase 2 (RSK2). Taking the putative 3D conformations of two weakly binding RSK2 NTKD inhibitors as query templates, SHAFTS was used to perform 3D similarity based virtual screening because of a lack of crystal structure of RSK2 protein, thus leading to the identification of several novel scaffolds that would have been missed by conventional 2D fingerprint methods. The most potent hit compounds show low micromolar inhibitory activities against RSK2. In particular, one of the hit compounds exhibits potent antimigration activity against the MDA-MB-231 tumor cell. The results exemplified SHAFTS? application in active enrichment and scaffold hopping, which is of general interest for lead identification in drug discovery endeavors and also provides novel scaffolds that lay the foundation for uncovering new RSK2 regulatory mechanisms. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

For the first time, our investigation demonstrates that B1 inhibited the growth of HeLa cells by the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Analysis of flow cytometry and western blots of HeLa cells treated with B1 revealed an appreciable cell cycle arrest and apoptotic induction in dose and time-dependent manner via the p53-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was detected using confocal microscopy in HeLa cells treated with B1. Accordingly, these data demonstrate that the anticancer activity of B1 is associated with the activation of p53 and the release of cytochrome c, which suggest that B1 might have therapeutic potential against cervix carcinoma as an effective lead compound. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

RSK2 comprises two terminal kinase domains (NTKD and CTKD) that can be inhibited by binding with different types of inhibitors at the ATP binding sites. In the absence of a crystal structure of RSK2, we constructed a model for the 3D structure of the RSK2 NTKD by homology modeling and stepwise constrained refinement with the reported inhibitors using a molecular docking method. Structure-based virtual screening was subsequently performed against a library containing commercially available compounds using the refined model. This resulted in the identification of seven novel RSK2 inhibitors with IC

The fluorescence intensity of 3 was significantly affected by the adding order of SDS and BSA, and SDS can be distinguished from other surfactants with the aid of BSA, but only when 3 is allowed to interact with BSA first. The results revealed that compound 3 is preferentially sited in the hydrophobic region of BSA, and thermodynamically in SDS-BSA mixed aggregate.

Switching of the selectivity of RI between various metal ions was achieved by judicious choice of sensing media.

84865043602	E2F1-dependent pathways are involved in amonafide analogue 7-d-induced DNA damage, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis in p53-deficient K562 cells	The E2F1 gene well known is its pivotal role in regulating the entry from G1 to S phase, while the salvage antitumoral pathway which implicates it, especially in the absence of p53, is not fully characterized. We therefore attempted to identify the up- and down-stream events involved in the activation of the E2F1-dependent pro-apoptotic pathway. For this purpose, a amonafide analogue, 7-d (2-(3-(2-(Dimethylamino)ethylamino)propyl)-6-(dodecylamino)-1H- benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione) was screened, which exhibited high antitumor activity against p53-deficient human Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) K562 cells. Analysis of flow cytometry and western blots of K562 cells treated with 7-d revealed an appreciable G2/M cycle arrest and apoptosis in a dose and time-dependent manner via p53-independent pathway. A striking increase in "Comet tail" formation and γ-H2AX expression showed that DNA double strand breaks (DSB) were caused by 7-d treatment. ATM/ATR signaling was reported to connect E2F1 induction with apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Indeed, 7-d-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis were antagonized by ATM/ATR signaling inhibitor, Caffeine, which suggested that ATM/ATR signaling was activated by 7-d treatment. Furthermore, the increased expression of E2F1, p73, and Apaf-1 and p73 dissociation from HDM2 was induced by 7-d treatment, however, knockout of E2F1 expression reversed p73, Apaf-1, and p21

We report here that 7b also shows high cytotoxicity against various T lymphoma cells, with the highest IC50 (concentration for 50% cytotoxicity) value in Jurkat cells. In a previous study, p53-mutant Raji cells were sensitive to 7b treatment. In the present study, the Jurkat T lymphoma cells were characterized as p53-null. Additional assays showed that 7b could induce G1/S phase arrest and mitochondrial apoptosis in Jurkat cells, suggesting 7b as a potential drug candidate for treatment of T-cell lymphoma. This action was not affected by p53 status. Further analysis of molecular mechanisms revealed that up-regulation of p21 and the Bak/Bcl-2 ratio and down-regulation of UHRF1 and c-Myc were attributed to p73 activation. In turn, up-regulation of p73 was initiated by DNA damage-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Interestingly, at non-toxic drug concentrations, 7b could also inhibit phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/phytohemagglutinin (PMA/PHA)-induced inflammatory responses of Jurkat T cells owing to the suppression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA-binding. Indeed, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and NF-κB binding assay showed that NF-κB DNA-binding was inhibited by 7b, and correspondingly, proinflammatory cytokine production was also decreased. In conclusion, 7b exhibits both antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities in T lymphoma cells. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

84875053571	Induction of apoptosis and suppression of ERCC1 expression by the potent amonafide analogue 8-c in human colorectal carcinoma cells	Previous studies have reported that 8-c [6-(2-(2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino) ethylamino)-2-octyl-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione], a novel amonafide analogue, was generated as a new anticancer candidate. However, little is known about its activity in chemoresistant cells. In this study, the antitumor effects of 8-c on the multi-drug-resistant human colorectal carcinoma cancer cell lines HCT-116/L-OHP and HCT-8/VCR have been investigated for the first time. 8-c showed similar concentration-dependent inhibitory activities against multi-drug-resistant cells and corresponding parental cell lines by the MTT assay after 48 h of treatment. 8-c treatment resulted in the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by fluorescent staining analysis, comet assay data, and the increase in the number of apoptotic cells as detected by flow cytometry. Western blot, qPCR, and siRNA techniques were used to elucidate the molecular mechanism. Our study suggested that the apoptotic effect of 8-c can be attributed to the upregulation of p53, caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the downregulation of Bcl-2. Furthermore, ERCC1 is essential for nucleotide excision repair. ERCC1 expression was correlated with sensitivity to chemotherapy in various colon cancer cell lines. It is intriguing that decreases in ERCC1 protein and mRNA levels were also observed in the HCT-116/L-OHP and HCT-8/VCR cells after exposure to 8-c. Further transient transfection of multi-drug-resistant cells with ERCC1 siRNA enhanced 8-c-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast, epidermal growth factor-induced increase in ERCC1 protein levels was shown to rescue cell viability upon 8-c treatment. These findings suggest that 8-c has a strong potential to be developed as a new antitumor agent for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant colon cancer cells, and is worthy of further studies. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Comparing with drugs combination, single molecule modulating desirable multiple targets has advantages in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics. Different from previous reviews, we provided an overview of reported multitarget antitumor agents from the viewpoint of pharmacophores. These multitarget antitumor agents were designed by combination of pharmacophores or by high-throughput screening plus structural modification, which were exemplified by the privileged pharmacophore quinazoline and several other popular pharmacophores, including phenylaminopyrimidine, anthracycline and naphthalimide. Previous research demonstrated the importance of in-depth validation against multiple targets not only in cell-free system, but also in cancer cells. Furthermore, the multitarget compounds were also effective for resistance cell lines which highlighted their antitumor potency in the era of increasing drug resistance in cancer patients. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84878586444	Versatile probes for the selective detection of vicinal-dithiol-containing proteins: Design, synthesis, and application in living cells	Endogenous vicinal-dithiol-containing proteins (VDPs) that have two thiol groups close to each other in space play a significant importance in maintaining the cellular redox microenvironment. Approaches to identify VDPs mainly rely on monitoring the different concentration of monothiol and total thiol groups or on indirect labeling of vicinal thiols by using p-aminophenylarsenoxide (PAO). Our previous work has reported the direct labeling of VDPs with a highly selective receptor PAO analogue, which could realize fluorescence detection of VDPs directly in living cells. Herein, we developed a conjugated approach to expand detectable tags to nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD), fluorescein, naphthalimide, and biotin for the synthesis of a series of probes. Different linkers have also been introduced toward conjugation of VTA2 with these functional tags. These synthesized flexible probes with various features will offer new tools for the potential identification and visualization of vicinal dithiols existing in different regions of VDPs in living cells. These probes are convenient tools for proteomics studies of various disease-related VDPs and for the discovery of new drug targets. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

CYP1 with a 4-position arylamine displayed efficient PET quenching, and exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity to NAT2 with no response to NAT1. For practical application, we demonstrated CYP1 could exhibit excellent performance for endogenous NAT2 fluorescence imaging in living mice. We further verified the NAT2 distribution in various tissues by detecting the response to the corresponding tissue homogenates. The results were consistent with the fluorescence imaging in vivo and previous research. Above all, the probe CYP1 could selectively and sensitively monitor the NAT2 activity in enzymatic system, living mice and tissue homogenate samples.

Here, we tried to further investigate its anti-inflammatory potential and the possible underlying mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and primary mouse macrophages. In our current study, ELISA and Real-time PCR revealed that non-toxic doses of 7b reduced the production and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells and primary mouse macrophages. Moreover, 7b dose-dependently suppressed the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO). Except for COX-1, non-toxic doses of 7b exhibited parallel inhibition of LPS-induced expression of COX-2 and iNOS at both mRNA and protein levels. The molecular mechanism was associated with inhibition of the phosphorylation/degradation of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65. Further analysis of upstream mechanisms showed that blocking of NF-κB activation by 7b was mediated by inhibiting TAK1-downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 kinase signal pathway. Taken together, these results indicated that 7b exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by targeting inhibiting TAK1, leading to ERK1/2- and p38 MAPK-mediated inactivation of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, and this would make 7b a strong candidate for further study as anti-inflammatory agent. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that the spectroscopic properties for these conjugates are strongly dependent on polarity and hydrogen bonding ability of solvents. Their fluorescence spectra are also strongly influenced by intramolecular aromatic stacking and hydrogen bonding between the base or sugar moiety of the uridine nucleoside and naphthalimide moiety, which is controlled by the length of the linker.
