1542707453	Noninvasive glucose monitoring by back diffusion via skin: Chemical and physical enhancements	Blood glucose levels are routinely obtained by invasive and painful methods using glucose meters and test strips. The development of less invasive or non invasive techniques would be beneficial for diabetes patients. In this study, a noninvasive method was evaluated using the back diffusion of glucose across skin with or without permeation enhancement methods. An in vitro model was utilized. The stratum corneum (SC) was the predominant barrier for both back and forward diffusion of glucose across skin. Surfactants with various charges and essential oils (cyclic monoterpenes) were used as chemical enhancers to promote the back diffusion of glucose. A cationic surfactant (benzalkonium chloride) showed the highest enhancement, followed by anionic and nonionic surfactants. d-Limonene and 1,8-cineole dispersed in appropriate proportions of ethanol could enhance the glucose diffusion after pretreatment of the skin surface. Electroporation, defined as a physical method, significantly increased the amount of glucose that diffused back. The percentages of diffused glucose by 300 V (volts) and 500 V high voltage pulses on skin for 10 min were found to be 45 and 75 times greater than the control group, respectively. © 2003 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

1842432571	The Influence of Anti-irritants on Captopril Hydrophilic Gel	In this study, we compared the irritation inhibition of various types of anti-irritants such as antihistamines (cyprohetadine, diphenhydramine, and promethazine), alpha-hydroxy acids (gluconolactone and gluco-δ-lactone), corticosteroids (betamethasone and clobetasol), and ion channel modulating agents (amiloride, ethacrynic acid, nifedipine, and verapamil) on the adverse dermatological reaction caused by captopril gel using noninvasive bioengineering methods including measuring the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and the color change of skin surface [such as change chroma (delta C) and difference in color (delta E) between the gel-treated site and the untreated site]. In addition, the influence of these anti-irritants on the penetration capacity of captopril through the rabbit skin was also investigated. The results showed that the TEWL, change chroma (delta C), and difference in color (delta E) of skin were significantly reduced via incorporating diphenhydramine and clobetasol, indicating that both substances had potent irritation inhibition activity. Moreover, these substances had no effect on the percutaneous absorption of captopril gel. However, flux of the captopril with anti-irritants was about 480 μg/cm

1842486791	Lipid Nano/Submicron Emulsions as Vehicles for Topical Flurbiprofen Delivery	The application of lipid nano/submicron emulsions as topical drug carrier systems for the percutaneous absorption of flurbiprofen was investigated. The lipid emulsions were made up of isopropyl myristate (IPM), soybean oil, or coconut oil as the oil phase, egg lecithin as the predominant emulsifier, and double-distilled water as the external phase. Stearylamine (SA) and deoxycholic acid (DA) also were used to produce positively and negatively charged emulsions. To evaluate the physicochemical properties of the lipid emulsions, particle size by laser light scattering, the image of atomic force microscopy, and relaxation time values by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were determined. The in vitro permeation data showed that incorporation of SA significantly reduced the topical delivery of flurbiprofen. On the other hand, incorporation of DA exhibited no or a negligible effect on drug permeation. Enhancement of drug absorption was observed when adding oleic acid as part of the oil phase. The in vivo topical application of flurbiprofen from selected lipid emulsions showed a similar trend to the in vitro status. Furthermore, the intersubject variability was considerably reduced by lipid emulsions than by aqueous suspensions in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. The irritant profiles of lipid emulsions showed that IPM elicited higher irritation than soybean oil. The incorporation of oleic acid also produced skin disruption. The results in the present study suggest the feasibility of lipid emulsions for the topical delivery of flurbiprofen.

0029916271	In vivo percutaneous absorption of capsaicin, nonivamide and sodium nonivamide acetate from ointment bases : Pharmacokinetic analysis in rabbits	Nonivamide (NVA) and nonpungent sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) are both synthetic derivatives of capsaicin. In this study, in vivo systemic drug plasma data of capsaicin, NVA and SNA following intravenous and transdermal ointment base administration in rabbits were performed to establish the pharmacokinetic analysis of these analogues. In order to describe the capsaicin, NVA and SNA plasma profiles observed, one-compartment pharmacokinetic open model for capsaicin and NVA, and two-compartment model for SNA was used in the i.v. plasma data. After the percutaneous administration, the plasma profiles between capsaicin and NVA were quite different although these two analogues showed similar physicochemical properties and intravenous pharmacokinetic parameters. The high plasma concentrations of SNA were obtained in the early period after transdermal application. This phenomenon suggested that SNA passes through skin via the intercellular and transappendageal routes. In the study of the in vivo percutaneous effect of NVA - SNA combined ointments, the result indicated that NVA and SNA could often act as the potent penetration enhancer for each other to higher absorption amount and bioavailability than individual NVA or SNA ointment base. The information of the pharmacokinetic analysis of capsaicin and its analogues in rabbits are helpful for the development of capsaicin, NVA and SNA transdermal drug delivery system.

0029917312	Effect of pretreatment by cardamom oil on in vitro percutaneous penetration of piroxicam gel	The effect of pretreatment by the penetration enhancer, cardamom oil, on the percutaneous penetration of piroxicam from gel through rabbit abdominal skin was investigated using an in vitro technique. The flux and the cumulative amount (at the 48th h) after 1 h pretreatment with 10% cardamom oil in three vehicle systems (alcohol, alcohol/pH 5.8 buffer and alcohol/pH 7.4 buffer) were higher than that of nonpretreatment, and were similar to that of 3 or 6 h pretreatment. A specific correlation between the flux of piroxicam and the pretreatment period was found. Compared to the lag time of skin penetration of piroxicam for nonpretreatment, the lag time for pretreatment was remarkably diminished. The penetration index (PI) of piroxicam after 1 h pretreatment with 100/o cardamom oil in alcohol/pH 7.4 buffer (50/40) was about 340.9-fold higher than that of nonpretreatment. In contrast to previous results, 1 h pretreatment with 10% cardamom oil in alcohol had no significant enhancing effect on the percutaneous penetration of piroxicam from gel dosage form. From these results, the alcohol proportion of the vehicle system was the more effective factor for penetration index.

0029938985	In vivo percutaneous absorption of capsaicin, nonivamide and sodium nonivamide acetate from ointment bases: Skin erythema test and non-invasive surface recovery technique in humans	Nonivamide (NVA) and sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) are both synthetic analogues of capsaicin. In this present study, the in vivo skin erythema test and non-invasive surface recovery techniques were performed in humans for capsaicin, NVA and SNA after transdermal ointment application. In order to quantify the skin erythema and irritation caused by capsaicin and its analogues, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was utilized for determining the cutaneous blood flow to assess the degree of irritant reaction. In the study of surface recovery technique, NVA hydrophilic ointment base showed higher flux and cumulative absorbed amount than the other formulations. In the study of skin erythema test, capsaicin caused severer skin irritation than NVA in humans. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the erythema levels of SNA and control group indicating that SNA produced no skin irritation or pungent sensation. In addition, increased skin temperatures were detected after transdermal application of capsaicin, NVA and SNA ointment bases. The trend of the skin temperature profiles was consistent with that of skin erythema test by laser Doppler flowmetry suggesting that increased skin temperatures may reflect the degree of vasodilation produced by irritation in the treated skin area. In the study of the skin erythema test using various concentration levels of capsaicin and NVA, the various doses from hydrophilic ointment did not markedly influence the pungent and irritant skin reactions after transdermal application.

0029985879	Percutaneous absorption of capsaicin, nonivamide and sodium nonivamide acetate from gel and ointment bases: In vitro formulation evaluations in pigs and in vivo bioengineering methods in humans	Nonivamide (NVA) and non-pungent sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) are synthetic derivatives of capsaicin. In this study, in vitro formulation evaluations in pigs and in vivo bioengineering methods in humans were performed to obtain the information on percutaneous absorption for capsaicin, NVA and SNA. After the consideration of penetration capacity, skin irritation and physicochemical properties of the formulations in vitro, 0.6% Carbopol 940® gel form for capsaicin and NVA as well as 3.8% isopropyl myristate-added hydrophilic o/w ointment for SNA were utilized to study the following in vivo test in humans. In the study of in vivo surface recovery techniques, SNA showed an equivalent therapeutic capability to that of NVA after calculation of the antinociceptive index. After the quantification of skin erythema by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), capsaicin caused more severe irritation than NVA in humans. In addition, SNA showed no skin irritation, toxicity and pungent sensation. The transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values were determined using an evaporimeter. A comparison of the gel form showed there was significantly higher TEWL AUC values in capsaicin and NVA than in the control group. The AUC value of the hydrophilic ointment control group was significantly higher than that of the gel control group. The reason was that isopropyl myristate and sodium laurylsulfate, two additives incorporated in the hydrophilic base, could cause slight skin irritation resulting in the increase of TEWL. The results of this study suggest that SNA possesses potent antinociceptive activities after transdermal application. Furthermore, SNA can be used extensively in clinical therapy because it avoids any pungent skin sensation and burning pain to improve patients' compliance.

0029789013	The preparation of norfloxacin-loaded liposomes and their in-vitro evaluation in pig's eye	The effectiveness of norfloxacin as an antibacterial agent in ophthalmology is limited by poor drug delivery and limited ocular bioavailability. Liposomes containing norfloxacin have been prepared from different phospholipids using a novel technique with an encapsulation efficiency sixteen times greater than that of a conventional film method. The in-vitro release of the norfloxacin and the transcorneal characteristics of the liposomes have been evaluated. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the interaction occurring between liposomes and cornea. The release of liposome-entrapped norfloxacin was affected by the pH of the environment. In the in-vitro corneal perfusion studies, norfloxacin-loaded liposome was transferred through the cornea at a slower rate than was the free drug. Norfloxacin-loaded liposomes were accumulated primarily in the cornea. The drug corneal retention of the lipids increased in the order dimyristoyl-L-α-phosphatidylcholine < dipalmitoyl-L-α-phosphatidylcholine < distearoyl-L-α-phosphatidylcholine. In the corneal drug-elimination study, liposomal norfloxacin increased the loading of the drug in cornea; the maximum value of the loading occurred 5 h after dosing. The drainage of liposomes from the cornea was somewhat slower than the solution form. Accumulation of norfloxacin in the cornea was greater for the liposome-entrapped drug. The results suggest that norfloxacin-loaded liposomes are absorbed by the cornea via endocytosis.

0030573079	Transdermal iontophoresis of sodium nonivamide acetate II: Optimization and evaluation on solutions and gels	Sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) is a newly designed derivative of capsaicin which reveals marked antinociceptive activity without producing an overt pungent sensation and skin irritation. The following iontophoretic drug delivery issues have been examined in this paper: (I) the competitive ion effect; (2) transdermal iontophoretic delivery from gel base; and (3) maximization of iontophoretic application mode from gel base. According to the theory of molal volume, divalent salt ions show higher buffering capacity on SNA iontophoretic transport than did monovalent salt ions. However, this effect also causes a great reduction of SNA transdermal flux. The experimental result of transdermal iontophoresis of gel indicated the flux of SNA decreased following the increase of viscosity. Using various polymers incorporated in gel formulations, indicated methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose showed higher capacity for SNA iontophoretic transport than the other materials. After a series of evaluation and optimization on the iontophoretic delivery of SNA, transdermal iontophoresis has provided a great capacity of enhancing SNA transport across the skin. The result of the present study is particularly helpful in the development of SNA transdermal delivery system and holds promise for the successful clinical development of an antinociceptive therapeutic regimen.

These results indicated that the pH dependency in skin permeability of zwitterionic drug may reflect the permselective property of the skin dependent on the lipophilicity and/or diffusivity of the ionic species. The surfactants were used as penetration enhancers to increase the percutaneous absorption of captopril. These surfactants all showed significant increase (ANOVA, P < 0.05) in the enhancing effect compared with that of the control group. Among the surfactants, sodium lauryl sulfate showed the greastest effect on the penetration which increased the flux approximately 58.8-fold and the enhancement increased following the increase of surfactant concentration.

0030601839	Transdermal iontophoresis of sodium nonivamide acetate I. Consideration of electrical and chemical factors	Transdermal iontophoresis is a process which enhances skin permeation of ionized species by an electrical field as driving force. The aim of this present study was to investigate the transdermal iontophoresis of a newly designed capsaicin derivative, sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA). Studies of electrical and physicochemical factors acting on the kinetics of in vitro iontophoresis were performed. Iontophoresis increased the transdermal penetration flux of SNA as compared to the passive diffusion in this study. Several application modes which possessed the same electrical energy had been researched. The iontophoretic flux of SNA increased following the decrease of donor buffer pH values. This trend could be due to the physiological property of skin and electro-osmotic flow presented. Comparing the various application modes, the discontinuous on/off cyclic current mode showed higher penetration capacity than did continuous mode which was due to the intensity of effective current which would not decay for on/off cyclic application of iontophoresis. The result of the present study is particularly helpful in the development of a SNA transdermal iontophoretic delivery system.

0030896468	In vitro percutaneouus absorption of captopril	Four available skin membranes (mouse, rat, rabbit, pig) and human skin were utilized to evaluate the in vitro penetration of captopril. The flux of captopril increased in the order of human = pig < rabbit < rat < mouse. The penetration rate of captopril through rabbit skin was optimal to evaluate the variation of formulations. Hence, the rabbit skin was picked out as a model membrane for in vitro penetration experiments of captopril. The flux of captopril was increased linearly when the concentration of captopril increased from 1% up to 10% (r = 0.9777). The enhancing effect of penetration enhancers including fatty alcohols (2C-14C), aliphatic esters (2C-10C) and other compounds on captopril penetration through excised rabbit skin were also evaluated.

0030955275	Characterization and stability of various liposome-encapsulated enoxacin formulations	The necessity for antibacterial agents with greater intracellular efficacy has led to the development of endocytosable drug carriers such as liposomes. Enoxacin was selected as a model drug incorporated in various liposome formulations as a therapeutic dosage form using the ethanol injection method and freeze-drying. Liposomal behavior after preparation and stability test was characterized by determining the physicochemical properties of enoxacin encapsulation percent, vesicle size and turbidity. The non-phospholipid formulation of stratum corneum liposomes showed the highest encapsulation efficiency after preparation among nine liposomal formulations. The addition of dissacharides in liposomes also enhanced the encapsulation of enoxacin due to the protection of phospholipid bilayers during the freeze- drying process. The liposomes with negatively charged component and dissacharides showed lower enoxacin leakage after five weeks of storage at 45°C, suggesting these formulations have high stability in long-term storage. The negative liposomes showed a different behavior than others in their decrease of size and turbidity during storage, possibly due to high surface charges of the negative formulation. Cholesterol stabilized bilayers interacted with plasma and high density lipoprotein (HDL) retained enoxacin in the vesicles. Nevertheless, liposomes with cholesterol caused a hydrolysis problem after incubation with normal saline. The formulation with trehalose not only showed high stability in storage but also in plasma and HDL. This suggested trehalose was useful to incorporate with phospholipids to produce a highly encapsulated and stabilized liposomes of enoxacin. This study also demonstrated that thought is required in utilizing turbidity as a direct index of liposomal vesicle size.

0030976074	Transdermal iontophoresis of sodium nonivamide acetate. III. Combined effect of pretreatment by penetration enhancers	The effect of iontophoresis combined with pretreatment of penetration enhancers such as benzalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, sodium laurylsulfate and isopropyl myristate on the transdermal transport of sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) and histologically structural properties of rat skin was undertaken. Cetylpyridinium chloride and isopropyl myristate showed the highest iontophoretic enhancement factor (E) and iontophoretic flux (J(I)) on the transdermal penetration of SNA after pretreatment with skin, respectively. However, because of the severe change on the histological structure of rat skin irritated by isopropyl myristate, its clinical use is limited. The iontophoretic flux of SNA of sodium laurylsulfate pretreatment group was lower than that of control group. The reason for this phenomenon was that iontophoretic transport of SNA would be restricted by the hindrance of sodium laurylsulfate molecules inhibiting entry into pores of the skin. In the study of the different pretreatment duration of penetration enhancer for time ranging from 6 to 24 h, the total enhancement factor over passive diffusion was decreased following the increase of pretreatment duration both in cetylpyridinium chloride- and isopropyl myristate-pretreated skin. This illustrated that penetration enhancers could largely influence the passive transport of SNA but only showed a minor effect on the iontophoretic transport of SNA. In the result for anatomical skin structures treated by current density, there was almost no change observed in the structure of skin after iontophoretic treatment as compared with the control group. Accordingly, iontophoretic delivery is a transdermal enhancement method with high safety. A combination of physical iontophoresis with the chemical enhancer may be a potential route for transdermal delivery of drugs as this present study indicates.

0030990125	Percutaneous absorption and skin erythema: Quantification of capsaicin and its synthetic derivatives from gels incorporated with benzalkonium chloride by using non-invasive bioengineering methods	Nonivamide (NVA) and sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) are synthetic derivatives of capsaicin. In this study, the cationic surfactant benzalkonium chloride was incorporated into the Carbopol 940® gel bases of capsaicin and its synthetic derivatives to evaluate the in vitro percutaneous absorption capacity. Afterwards, the optimal gel formulation selected from the in vitro study was used in a series of in vivo non-invasive bioengineering methods. To quantify the:skin erythema and irritation caused by capsaicin, NVA, and SNA, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and colorimetry were utilized for determining the cutaneous blood flow and skin barrier impairment to assess the level of irritant reaction. In the in vitro transdermal study, the gel base with 0.05% benzalkonium chloride possessed the highest penetration capacity: this was chosen for the in vivo study. After quantification of skin erythema by LDF, capsaicin developed more severe irritation than NVA, and SNA showed no skin irritation or pungent sensation in volunteers. The result of the TEWL experiment suggested that 0.05% benzalkonium chloride did not cause any skin impairment. Moreover, the Carbopol 940® gel base itself offered a moderate penetration capacity for drugs and avoided any skin irritation. The result of colorimetry confirmed that both Δa* and ΔE* parameters correlated well with the data of LDF and that they are good indicators of skin erythema response. After a series of in vivo applications, SNA was shown to be a potent analogue of capsaicin with a marked pharmacological effect and moderate percutaneous capacity and reduced skin erythema and painful sensation.

The designed system was essentially based on natural rubber or polymeric Gelva® dispersion. The characterization of physicochemical properties of the patches showed adequate adhesive force and low thickness which suggested these patch formulations possessed good quality. In the study of in vitro percutaneous experiment, the predicted therapeutic activities of patches were all higher than that of a commercially available plaster after the calculation of antinociceptive index. The highest in vitro penetration flux was found in the Gelva® patch for NVA. The result of in vivo experiments revealed a high obverse correlation with that of in vitro experiments. The information of this present study is helpful for the further development of NVA and SNA transdermal drug delivery system.

0031788078	Transdermal delivery of sodium nonivamide propionate by iontophoresis	The aim of this study was to investigate the transdermal iontophoresis of a newly designed capsaicin derivative, sodium nonivamide propionate (SNP). The iontophoretic permeation of SNP from various pH buffers increased following the decrease of pH values. This trend was consistent with that of sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) which is another synthetic analogue of capsaicin. However, the iontophoretic permeability of SNP was much lower than that of SNA. SNP was also delivered iontophoretically from hydrogel formulations. It is suggested that ionizable polymers should be avoided for iontophoretic delivery to maintain good penetration capacity of drugs. Both nonionic cellulose polymers of methylcellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) showed higher iontophoretic flux for SNP than the others did. Furthermore, the flux of SNP leveled off with an increase in the amount of polymers in hydrogel, indicating that the viscosity of vehicles plays an important role in the permeation of SNP. Comparing the various iontophoretic application modes, the discontinuous on/off cyclic mode showed higher penetration capacity than did the continuous mode although they possessed the same electrical energy. Moreover, the desorption time of SNP from skin was approximately 20 min which was longer than that of SNA.

Three commercially available formulations and three cream bases prepared in our laboratory according to Pharmacopoeia or registered patent were evaluated in this present study. The amount of CP in the receptor phase of diffusion cell was negligible in the beginning of administration due to the process of saturation of drug in skin reservoir, then the CP molecules pass through the skin directly because of the saturation of receptors in skin reservoir followed the higher flux of CP in the later period. It was suggested that the incorporation of penetration enhancers was the possible reason mainly controlling the flux of CP creams. Nevertheless, CP residue in skin and the lag time of formulations prepared in our laboratory were not significantly higher than those of commercial ones, which indicated penetration enhancer could not dominate the local pharmacological effectiveness of CP though they played a main part on the skin penetration capacity of formulations. The antiinflammatory activity of CP was assessed in the ear of Wistar rat. According to the result of antiinflammatory activity, all formulations showed significant inhibition on oedema suggesting the role of drug itself may be more important than that of vehicle in controlling the therapy efficacy.

0032444168	Transdermal iontophoresis of sodium nonivamide acetate. IV. Effect of polymer formulations	The patch or semisolid dosage form is more applicable than solution as a transdermal iontophoretic delivery system to be administered clinically. Therefore the effect of iontophoresis for sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) from various polymer formulations was investigated by using an in vitro permeation study. The cumulative amount-time curves were suitable to fit by a zero-order equation which indicated a steady-state permeation rate or sustained release effect could be achieved from polymer hydrogels. The permeability coefficient of SNA from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) were similar and showed the highest penetration capacity among six individual polymers. In order to develop optimal devices for clinical utilization, blends of two polymers as binary system formulations were prepared in order to attain acceptable bioadhesion and viscosity. The binary cellulose-PVP formulations apparently improve the mechanical characteristics of hydrogel. Moreover, the flux of SNA from these binary systems increased in the order of methylcellulose (MC)+PVP<hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)+PVP<HPC+PVP, which was consistent with the rank order of the SNA permeability coefficient from three individual cellulose derivatives. After the examination of pH shift during iontophoresis, HPMC could provide a sufficient buffer capacity to stabilize the pH value of the donor in an electrical field. Isopropyl myristate showed an enhancing iontophoretic flux of SNA after pretreatment with skin, possibly due to the ability of water accumulation in the skin reservoir. However, Azone showed no or negative effect on iontophoretic transport of SNA. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

0032516634	Development and evaluation on transdermal delivery of enoxacin via chemical enhancers and physical iontophoresis	Iontophoresis and enhancers were performed to enhance percutaneous absorption of enoxacin so as to compare the enhancement between these two enhancing methods. The cationic surfactant of benzalkonium chloride showed the highest enhancing activity for enoxacin for all pH values of buffer vehicles. The enhancement factor of sodium laurylsulfate showed a dose-dependent property between the range of 0.1% to 3.0% concentration. Nonionic surfactant of Polysorbate 80 did not exhibit any enhancing effect on the percutaneous absorption of enoxacin. The highest enhancement factor of iontophoretic delivery was observed at pH 5.0 solution of anodal iontophoresis for cationic enoxacin. The cathodal iontophoresis of negative molecules and anodal iontophoresis of neutral molecules showed lower enhancing effect for enoxacin. The fact that the skin residuals of enoxacin after iontophoresis showed both tremendous and current density-dependent amounts for cationic enoxacin suggested local skin and soft tissue infections might be treated by this physical enhancement method. Combination of benzalkonium chloride and iontophoresis exerted a synergistic effect for anionic enoxacin in pH 10.0, which was possibly due to the shielding of negative charge in skin and the water molecules carried by chloride.

24944441696	Electrically-assisted skin permeation of two synthetic capsaicin derivatives, sodium nonivamide acetate and sodium nonivamide propionate, via rate-controlling polyethylene membranes	The objective of this study was to examine the transdermal delivery of sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) using iontophoresis and electroporation with ultra high molecular weight polyethylene membranes (Solupor® ) to achieve controlled transdermal drug delivery. A derivative of SNA, sodium nonivamide propionate (SNP), was also used as a model drug in this investigation. Iontophoresis increased the transdermal permeation of SNA as compared to passive diffusion. Most Solupor membranes were rate-limiting for the iontophoretic permeation of SNA except for Solupor 8P07, which showed negligible resistance to SNA delivery. The tortuosity (Gurley number), pore size, and the current density-induced attachments on the surface of the Solupor membranes may have been important for their rate-controlling effect. The trends for inhibiting or controlling SNA permeation were similar for both iontophoretic and electroporation applications. The higher molecular size and lower hydrophilicity of SNP compared to SNA resulted in lower permeation of SNP using electrically-assisted methods. Moreover, the various types of Solupor membranes showed similar trends for both SNA and SNP. This present study indicates that Solupor membranes act as rate-limiting membranes for controlling the release and skin permeation of both SNA and SNP by electrically-assisted methods. © 2005 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

3142562736	Influence of formulation variables and manufacturing process on propranolol extended release profile from HPMC matrices tablets	The influences of some formulation variables and manufacturing processes of the release rates of propranolol from gelation of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) matrices tablets were investigated. The amount of propranolol was determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy at 290 nm. The effects of extended release of matrices tablets were evaluated by the in vitro dissolution test and were compared to the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) monograph specifications. The results showed that the lowest viscosity grade of HPMC (Metolose 4000) used gave the least burst effect in the earlier stage. The drug/Metolose ratio was an important influence on the drug release; increasing the polymer content decreased the dissolution rate of the drug. The release rate was increased with increase in the tablet content of avicel. The release curve of experimental formulation with 17% avicel was optimal compared with the USP monograph specification; there was no burst effect in the earlier stage (the release percent at 1.5 h was 26.6%) and almost total drug was released from matrices tablet after 24 h (97.4%). The other factors such as lubricant level (0.5 to 2.0%), compaction pressure (100 to 200 kPa), brand of HPMC (HPMC 4000 from Shin Etsu or Methocel K4MP from Dow Chemical Co.), and manufacturing process (tabletted from wet-massed granules or by direct compression) appeared not to modify release rates. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33847024293	The effect of Eudragit and enteric polymer composite on the release of nicardipine	The purpose of this study was to investigate the sustained release of nicardipine/polymer solid dispersions prepared by solvent evaporation method. The release pattern of drug from solid dispersions was evaluated by the dissolution test in both dissolution medium of phosphate buffer pH 6.8 or gastric acid fluid pH 1.2, and was compared with a commercial long acting product Perdipine®. The results showed that the formulations with lower ratio of Nicardipine/Eudragit RS (N/RS) (below 1/ 5) had sustained release effect in gastric acid fluid (pH 1.2). The release rate of formulation of N/RS = 1/5 was slightly faster than that of Perdipine® in gastric acid fluid in the early stage. On the contrary, the release rate was lower than that of Perdipine® in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). The enteric polymers such as HPMCAS-LF grade (HPMCAS) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, HP-55 grade (HPMCP) were incorporated into the formulation of NC/ERS = 1/5 solid dispersion to improve the drug release in both dissolution medium. It was found that the dissolution efficiencies of drug were increased 2.35-21.08 folds with the addition of 20-40% of enteric polymer in pH 6.8 media. Among these formulations of N/RS/HPMCP = 1/3.5/1.5 had similar dissolution pattern with Perdipine® in either medium of phosphate buffer or gastric acid fluid (f

34648812680	The effect of mixed-solvent and terpenes on percutaneous absorption of meloxicam gel	The purpose of the present study was to develop the meloxicam transdermal dosage form. The response surface methodology was used to obtain an appropriate mixed-solvent system of pH-7.4 buffer and ethanol for preparing meloxicam hydrogel. The enhancement effects of terpenes on drug precautious absorption were evaluated via in vitro and in vivo study. The result showed that the solubility of meloxicam was dependent on the pH value of buffer solution. The mixed-solvent system of pH-7.4 buffer and ethanol had a synergistic effect on the increase of drug solubility. The highest solubility was obtained in the ratio of 50/50 pH 7.4 buffer/ethanol. A series of terpenes were used as enhancer for improving the penetration rate of meloxicam. The penetration rates were significantly increased by about 70-593 fold and the lag times were shortened from 7.92 to 0.17 hr by enhancer incorporation. Among these terpenes, menthol showed the greatest effect. In vivo penetration study, the AUC48h was increased by about 1.7 fold by the addition of 5% menthol as enhancer.

37349070280	Transdermal delivery of capsaicin derivative-sodium nonivamide acetate using microemulsions as vehicles	The objective of this study was to prepare sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) microemulsion for topical administration. Microemulsions consisted of a mixed surfactant of Tween 80 and Span 20 as surfactant, ethanol as cosurfactant, isopropyl myristate (IPM) as an oil phase and water as an external phase. The effect of composition of microemulsion including the ratio of oil phase/surfactant/aqueous phase, various cosurfactant and polymer on the character and permeability of microemulsion were evaluated. The mean droplet size of SNA microemulsions ranged from 64 to 208 nm. Microemulsions showed potent enhancement effect for SNA transdermal delivery by a 3.7-7.1-fold increase when compared with the control group. Microemulsion containing ethanol as cosurfactant had the highest enhancement effect. With incorporated polymer, the viscosity of microemulsions increased resulting in the decrease in penetration rate of SNA. However, the permeability of SNA delivered from microemulsion was higher than SNA from volatile vehicles (pH 4.2 buffer containing 25% ethanol) reported in an earlier study, therefore microemulsions could be an effective vehicle for topical delivery of SNA. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

0032914796	Transdermal delivery of sodium nonivamide acetate from volatile vehicles: Effects of polymers	The permeation of sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA), a newly designed analogue of capsaicin, from ethanol/pH 4.2 buffer solutions containing antinucleant polymers across rat skin, was investigated. The in vitro release of SNA was determined under an open condition at 25°C and 65% relative humidity. Therefore, the influence of the evaporation of vehicle components on the permeation of SNA was examined. Evaporation of the vehicle led to so drastic compositional changes that supersaturation is attained quickly. However, supersaturated solutions started to crystallize reducing the thermodynamic activity of SNA. Antinucleant polymers were used in the preparation of volatile vehicles in order to maintain the increased activity state of the drug. Methyl cellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) were both the efficient antinucleant polymers to increase the permeation of SNA. The permeation of SNA determined from volatile vehicles with 2% MC showed the result that the flux of SNA reached maximum at a certain ethanol proportion. A part of ethanol in the vehicle may penetrate into the skin causing the dehydration of stratum corneum and, therefore, the reduction of SNA permeation. The permeation of SNA was increased when ethanol in the volatile vehicle was replaced by n-propanol which could be due to the increased SNA solubility and reduction of diffusional barrier of stratum corneum in the presence of n-propanol.

0032916999	Transdermal iontophoresis of sodium nonivamide acetate evaluated by in vivo microdialysis and histologic study	By using an intradermal microdialysis technique 22 h after the transdermal iontophoretic delivery of sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA), a synthetic derivative of capsaicin, the amount of SNA in the extracellular space was measured. Transdermal iontophoresis is a process that enhances skin permeation of ionized species by using an electric field as a driving force. Iontophoresis increased the amount of SNA in dialysate compared with passive diffusion in this study. By using various polymers incorporated in formulations, indicated hydrogels showed higher capacity for SNA delivery than solution formulations. This result was possibly attributable to the antinucleant ability of polymers resulting in the increase of thermodynamic activity of SNA in formulations. Pretreatment with isopropyl myristate, a lipophilic penetration enhancer, on rat skin enhanced transdermal delivery of SNA both for passive and iontophoretic penetration, indicating the possibility of reducing the surface area of the administrations site in clinical use. Microscopic examination revealed no or slight changes in the skin after iontophoretic treatment compared with penetration enhancer pretreatment. The histologic results also suggested iontophoretic treatment with 0.5 mA/cm

0033671983	Passive and iontophoretic delivery of three diclofenac salts across various skin types	The in vitro permeation of three diclofenac salts - diclofenac sodium (DFS), diclofenac potassium (DFP) and diclofenac diethylammonium (DFD) - across skin by both passive and iontophoretic transport were investigated. Various skin types were used as the barriers to elucidate the mechanism controlling transdermal delivery of diclofenac salts. The importance of the intercellular (paracellular) route for both DFS and DFP in passive permeation was elucidated. The transfollicular route constitutes an important permeation pathway for DFS but not for DFP. The route and mechanism for transdermal iontophoresis of DFD across the skin was somewhat different to that of the other salts. Hair follicles may be a more important pathway for DFD than for DFS and DFP under iontophoresis, while the intercellular lipid pathway showed the opposite result. Combination of iontophoresis and a penetration enhancer, cardamom oil, did not show a synergistic effect on diclofenac salt permeation. The results of this investigation suggest that the transdermal mechanism and the route of diclofenac salt uptake via passive and iontophoretic transport can be affected by their counterions.

0032950395	In vitro study of transdermal nicotine delivery: Influence of rate- controlling membranes and adhesives	The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a rate- controlling membrane and adhesive on the in vitro permeation of nicotine. The physicochemical properties of the adhesive, including adhesion and rheology (viscosity), were also detected. Higher permeability of nicotine was observed through a hydrophilic membrane than through a hydrophobic membrane. Natural rubber and silicone were used as the adhesive bases, respectively. The silicone adhesive showed the highest adhesion among all adhesive formulations. To increase the adhesion of natural rubber, a tackifier (polyisoprene) and a secondary tackifier (terpene polymer; Px 1150®) were incorporated into the formulations to achieve acceptable adhesion. The nicotine permeation through silicone adhesive and three natural rubber adhesives with the secondary tackifier (2%, 4%, and 6% Px 1150) was close to that from a commercially available patch (Habitrol®), although the loading amount of nicotine was not the same. A longer lag time during the in vitro permeation study of nicotine was required for the adhesives prepared in our laboratory than for the commercially available patch.

0032964033	Evaluation of topical application of clobetasol 17-propionate from various cream bases	The effect of clobetasol 17-propionate (CP), a potent corticosteroid, in various cream bases on the permeation through artificial membrane was sought. Four formulations were then chosen for a further in vivo skin blanching assay. After calculation of the relationship between in vivo flux(0-8hr) determined from a surface recovery technique and in vitro release rate(0- 8hr) of CP from various formulations, a high correlation coefficient of 0.9996 was achieved. Therefore, the in vitro release study could be used as an index to predict and evaluate the in vivo penetration capacity of CP cream to screen the effective formulation preclinically. After a series of in vivo investigations in this study, it was concluded that myristic acid-added formulations may show a bioequivalence with commercial Dermovate®. Furthermore, the flux calculated from the surface recovery technique and ΔE°detected from the skin blanching assay may be useful as parameters evaluating the quality and effectiveness of CP cream.

0032964519	Evaluation of transdermal iontophoresis of enoxacin from polymer formulations: In vitro skin permeation and in vivo microdialysis using Wistar rat as an animal model	Polymers were used in vehicles to form hydrogel matrices in this study to evaluate the in vitro permeation and in vivo microdialysis of enoxacin. The highest transdermal delivery determined by area under flux-time curve (AUC) and intracutaneous enoxacin concentration were observed in methylcellulose (MC) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) hydrogels, respectively. To avoid the pH shift in vehicles during iontophoresis, buffer species were added to formulations to increase the buffer capacity. As expected, the permeability of enoxacin of anodal iontophoresis was larger than that of cathodal iontophoresis. Combination of benzalkonium chloride, a cationic surfactant as an enhancer, and iontophoresis exerted an enhancing effect for anionic enoxacin at pH 10.0. However, no effect or a negative effect was detected for cationic enoxacin in deionized water or pH 5.0 buffer, due to the shielding of the negative charge in the skin. The skin residue of enoxacin was slightly increased after the incorporation of Azone in PVP hydrogel. The result of in vivo microdialysis was in accordance with that of in vitro study. The effect of Azone on the intracutaneous enoxacin was more significant for in vivo microdialysis than in the in vitro study indicating the clinical feasibility of Azone for iontophoretic delivery. Microdialysis can be considered as a useful technique to investigate the pharmacokinetics of transdermal iontophoresis in vivo. Copyright (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

0032973192	Cyclic monoterpene extract from cardamom oil as a skin permeation enhancer for indomethacin: In vitro and in vivo studies	The in vitro and in vivo effect of pretreatment by cardamom oil, a crude drug extract, in ethanol/water vehicles on the transdermal delivery of indomethacin was investigated. The cyclic monoterpene components in cardamom oil were also determined and quantified in this study. The permeation of indomethacin was significantly enhanced after pretreatment of cardamom oil both in the in vitro and in vivo studies. The result of various pretreatment periods showed that the indomethacin flux decreased as the length of the pretreatment increased. Both natural cardamom oil and a cyclic monoterpene mixture composed of the components of the oil showed similar enhancement on indomethacin permeation, indicating cyclic monoterpenes are the predominant components altering the barrier property of stratum corneum. The results also showed that three minor components in cardamom oil (α-pinene, 6.5%; β- pinene, 4.8%; α-terpineol, 0.4%) had a synergistic effect with 1,8-cineole (59.3%) and d-limonene (29.0%) to enhance the permeation of indomethacin.

40949159792	Physicochemical and safety evaluation of 5-aminolevulinic acid in novel liposomes as carrier for skin delivery	In this study we successfully entrapped 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in liposome, although it exists as a zwitter ion. A molar ratio of 2:1:2.5 phosphatidyle-thanolamine (PE)/cholesterol/sodium stearate represented the best condition to achieve high entrapment efficiency (29.37 ± 1.21%), and the average vehicle size was 133.6 ± 2.8 nm. After 32 days of storage, the vehicle sizes of formulations with PE series were still approximately less than 200 nm. The safety of liposomes was tested and ensured both with regard to cellular cytotoxicity and erythrocyte hemolysis. Safety studies showed that liposome formulations did not affect cell viability except when both potassium stearate and sodium oleate were added. Moreover, PE and PE/cholesterol did not damage human erythrocytes in this study. The range of the hemolytic effect caused by liposomes was 5 to 37% and the effect was dependent on the amount of sodium stearate added to the formulation. According to the release rates and skin penetration of ALA liposomes in vitro, PE/cholesterol/sodium stearate liposomes might increase skin penetration, and it was shown that penetration across the stratum-corneum (sc) layer was the rate-limiting process. Images from confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed the great potency of liposomes for delivering ALA into skin.

42649086013	Comparison of 5-aminolevulinic acid-encapsulated liposome versus ethosome for skin delivery for photodynamic therapy	Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an alternative therapy for many non-melanoma skin cancers. The major limitation of this therapy, however, is the low permeability of ALA through the stratum corneum (SC) of the skin. The objective of the present work was to characterize ethosomes containing ALA and to enhance the skin production of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), compared to traditional liposomes. Results showed that the average particle sizes of the ethosomes were less than those of liposomes. Moreover, the entrapment efficiency of ALA in the ethosome formulations was 8-66% depending on the surfactant added. The particle size of the ethosomes was still approximately <200 nm after 32 days of storage. An in vivo animal study observed the presence of PpIX in the skin by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results indicated that the penetration ability of ethosomes was greater than that of liposomes. The enhancements of all the formulations were ranging from 11- to 15-fold in contrast to that of control (ALA in an aqueous solution) in terms of PpIX intensity. In addition, colorimetry detected no erythema in the irradiated skin. The results demonstrated that the enhancement ratio of ethosome formulations did not significantly differ between the non-irradiated and irradiated groups except for PE/CH/SS, which may have been due to a photobleaching effect of the PDT-irradiation process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

4444234554	Determination of xanthonolol by high performance liquid chromatography for pharmacokinetic studies in rats	A rapid and simple HPLC method was developed for the determination of xanthonolol concentration in plasma. The sample preparation utilized liquid-liquid extraction before injection into the HPLC system. Phenazine was used as the internal standard. Separation was obtained using a reversed-phase column under isocratic conditions. The mobile phase consisted of a 65% McIlvaine buffer containing 0.05% triethylamine adjusted to pH 6.4 with phosphoric acid, 18% acetonitrile, and 17% methanol. Xanthonolol was detected at the ultraviolet wavelength 235 nm. The lower limit of quantization was 50 ng/mL. The assay was applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats. The plasma concentration of xanthonolol versus time data were best fitted to a two-compartment open model with first-order elimination processes. After the intravenous administration of xanthonolol at three different dosages of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, the respective pharmacokinetic parameters, such as apparent volume of distribution, half-life, and clearance, showed no significant difference at three different dosages. Also, the area under the plasma concentration time curves for three dosages increased proportionally with dose. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of xanthonolol was found to be linear over the dose range studied.

70350427673	Topical delivery of 5-aminolevulinic acid-encapsulated ethosomes in a hyperproliferative skin animal model using the CLSM technique to evaluate the penetration behavior	Psoriasis, an inflammatory skin disease, exhibits recurring itching, soreness, and cracked and bleeding skin. Currently, the topical delivery of 5-aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is an optional treatment for psoriasis which provides long-term therapeutic effects, is non-toxic and enjoys better compliance with patients. However, the precursor of ALA is hydrophilic, and thus its ability to penetrate the skin is limited. Also, little research has provided a platform to investigate the penetration behavior in disordered skin. We employed a highly potent ethosomal carrier (phosphatidylethanolamine; PE) to investigate the penetration behavior of ALA and the recovery of skin in a hyperproliferative murine model. We found that the application of ethosomes produced a significant increase in cumulative amounts of 5-26-fold in normal and hyperproliferative murine skin samples when compared to an ALA aqueous solution; and the ALA aqueous solution appeared less precise in terms of the penetration mode in hyperproliferative murine skin. After the ethosomes had been applied, the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) intensity increased about 3.64-fold compared with that of the ALA aqueous solution, and the penetration depth reached 30-80 μm. The results demonstrated that the ethosomal carrier significantly improved the delivery of ALA and the formation of PpIX in both normal and hyperproliferative murine skin samples, and the expression level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was reduced after the ALA-ethosomes were applied to treat hyperproliferative murine skin. Furthermore, the results of present study encourage more investigations on the mechanism of the interaction with ethosomes and hyperproliferative murine skin. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

76549120706	In vitro permeation and in vivo whitening effect of topical hesperetin microemulsion delivery system	Hesperetin is one of the flavonoids and possess anti-inflammatory, UV-protecting and antioxidant effects. Permeation issues for topical delivery systems of such effects are occasionally problematic, and in view of the fact that microemulsions are potential carriers for transdermal delivery system, the objective of this study was to design an optimal microemulsion formulation by in vitro permeation study for hesperetin topical dosage form and determine its topical photoprotective effect and skin irritation by in vivo study. The hesperetin-loaded microemulsion showed an enhanced in vitro permeation compared to the aqueous and isopropyl myristate (IPM) suspension dosage form of hesperetin. In comparison, the effect of co-surfactant on the drug permeation capacity, propylene glycol showed highest permeation rate, followed by ethanol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG 400). Sunscreen agent padimate O, as a transdermal enhancer could increase the permeation rate of hesperetin. In case of in vivo study, the hesperetin-loaded microemulsion showed significant topical whitening effect and diminished skin irritation when compared with the non-treatment group, indicating that the hesperetin microemulsion could be used as an effective whitening agent. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

0035857726	In vitro skin permeation of estradiol from various proniosome formulations	The skin permeation of estradiol from various proniosome gel formulations across excised rat skin was investigated in vitro. The encapsulation efficiency and size of niosomal vesicles formed from proniosomes upon hydration were also characterized. The encapsulation (%) of proniosomes with Span surfactants showed a very high value of ≒100%. Proniosomes with Span 40 and Span 60 increased the permeation of estradiol across skin. Both penetration enhancer effect of non-ionic surfactant and vesicle-skin interaction may contribute to the mechanisms for proniosomes to enhance estradiol permeation. Niosome suspension (diluted proniosomal formulations) and proniosome gel showed different behavior in modulating transdermal delivery of estradiol across skin. Presence or absence of cholesterol in the lipid bilayers of vesicles did not reveal difference in encapsulation and permeation of the associated estradiol. The types and contents of non-ionic surfactant in proniosomes are important factors affecting the efficiency of transdermal estradiol delivery. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0035902673	Evaluation of percutaneous absorption and skin irritation of ketoprofen through rat skin: In vitro and in vivo study	The influences of different mechanisms of penetration enhancers (such as menthol, azone, ethanol and nonivarnide) regarding the percutaneous absorption and skin irritation of ketoprofen formulations through rat skin were investigated by in vitro and in vivo study. The skin irritation degree at the end of the experiment (10 h) was deterinined by pathologic biopsy and colorimetry methods. In vitro, the menthol showed the most potent enhancing effect. Furthermore, the enhancement effect of a combination of menthol and nonivamide was higher than that of their individual use alone. In vivo the formulation containing 0.05% nonivantide, 5% menthol and 20% ethanol showed a higher penetration rate and an acceptable degree of skin irritation compared to a commercial product (Formax plus® gel containing 3% ketoprofen), indicating that it could be used in the clinical situation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0035984942	In vitro topical application and in vivo pharmacodynamic evaluation of nonivamide hydrogels using Wistar rat as an animal model	Nonivamide, a so-called synthetic capsaicin, is a substitute for capsaicin which has a similar chemical structure and pharmacological activities as those of capsaicin. The purposes of this study were to explore the in vivo pharmacodynamic responses of nonivamide in hydrogels using Wistar rat as an animal model and to correlate the in vivo results with in vitro topical application. The incorporation of Pluronic F-127 polymer into hydrogels resulted in retarded release of nonivamide. Chitosan and carboxymethylcellulose hydrogels produced higher levels of in vitro nonivamide permeation and skin distribution. The in vivo effects of nonivamide on skin perturbation and vasodilation were found to differ depending on dose and duration after topical application. Quantification of transepidermal water loss was demonstrated to correlate with the measured in vitro skin distribution of nonivamide. The various doses of nonivamide in the hydrogels did not markedly influence erythematous reactions of skin as determined by colorimetric measurements. Hydrogel formulations of nonivamide delivered more drug to the skin and produced greater pharmacodynamic activities than did cream bases of capsaicin. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0035999782	Chitin/PLGA blend microspheres as a biodegradable drug-delivery system: Phase-separation, degradation and release behavior	A novel chitin-based microsphere was developed for anti-cancer drug-delivery purpose in the present study. These biodegradable microspheres were prepared by directly blending chitin with different contents of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide 50:50) (PLGA 50/50) in dimethylacetamide-lithium chloride solution, and following it by coagulating in water via wet phase inversion. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrography of the blend microsphere showed that there are numerous PLGA particulates homogeneously dispersed in chitin matrix, suggesting the occurrence of obvious phase separation from the blended chitin and PLGA 50/50 phase due to their thermodynamic incompatibility. Degradation of the chitin/PLGA 50/50 blend microsphere depends on the surface erosion of chitin phase and bulk hydrolysis of PLGA phase, according to the examinations of SEM and differential scanning calorimetry studies. Weight loss of the chitin/PLGA 50/50 blend microsphere increases with the increase of chitin content in the microsphere. A two-phase drug-release model is observed from the release of chlorambucil from chitin/PLGA 50/50 blend microspheres. The initial stage of drug-release rate increases with the increased chitin content due to the hydration and surface erosion of hydrophilic chitin phase; however, the following stage of slow release is sustained for several days, mainly contributed by the bulk hydrolysis of hydrophobic PLGA phase. In conclusion, such a chitin/PLGA 50/50 blend microsphere is novel and interesting, and may be used as a special drug-delivery system. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0036614628	Monitoring amino acid neurotransmitters in plasma profiles and predicting early progression of ischemic stroke	Progressing stroke is a devastating condition, but neither a good nor a safe predictor has been determined in previous studies. Elevated levels of excitatory amino acid (glutamate) and inhibitory amino acid (glycine) have been detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain tissue after acute ischemic stroke by microdialysis studies in humans. However which amino acid is increased in plasma and the duration of elevation after acute ischemic stroke is still unclear in spite of the fact that there is a positive correlation of glutamate concentrations between CSF and plasma in progressing strokes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate these amino acids in plasma could predict acute ischemic stroke or progression of ischemic strokes. The study included 22 ischemic stroke patients admitted within 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset. The plasma concentrations of glutamate and glycine were determined by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography). Progression was defined as when the NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) rose by three or more points within 48 hours after acute ischemic stroke. The infarction area was calculated from brain CT (brain computerized tomography) or brain MRI (magnetic resonance image) when the infarct was not visible on brain CT. Our study found a rapid elevation of glycine but not glutamate in plasma during stroke progression. Significantly lower AUC (area under plasma concentration -time curve) levels of glutamate and glycine during progression was also found in large vessel infarction including middle cerebral artery occlusion or internal carotid artery occlusion. This indicates that plasma glycine may be a good and non-invasive predictor for progressing stroke. Low AUC of plasma glutamate and glycine in progressing stroke may indicate a large vessel infarct and act as a poor prognostic factor in acute ischemic stroke.

79956321515	Elastic liposomes as carriers for oral delivery and the brain distribution of (+)-catechin	The aim of this work was to investigate whether the oral bioavailability and brain regional distribution of (+)-catechin could be improved by utilizing elastic liposomes. Liposomes containing soy phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and Tween 80 in the presence of 15% ethanol were prepared by a thin-film method and subsequent sonication and extrusion. The size, zeta potential, and stability of the liposomes in simulated gastrointestinal (GI) media were characterized. The mean size of liposomes was 3570nm, which decreased with an increase in the Tween 80 concentration. The zeta potential of the system was about-15 mV. More than 80% of the (+)-catechin was entrapped in the aqueous core of liposomes produced with 1% Tween 80. Liposomes entrapping (+)-catechin remained stable in the presence of GI fluids, especially in simulated intestinal fluid. The liposomes showed suppressed and sustained release of (+)-catechin compared with that from an aqueous solution. The aqueous control and liposomes were orally administered to rats. The blood level of liposomal (+)-catechin was enhanced at a later stage after administration compared with the free control. In the experiment on the brain distribution, liposomes with elastic properties showed 2.9-and 2.7-fold higher (+)-catechin accumulations compared with the aqueous solution in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, respectively. Greater compound accumulations with liposomes were also detected in the striatum and thalamus. The experimental results suggest that elastic liposomes may offer a promising strategy for improving (+)-catechin delivery via oral ingestion. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

80051727052	Formulation optimization of transdermal meloxicam potassium-loaded mesomorphic phases containing ethanol, oleic acid and mixture surfactant using the statistical experimental design methodology	Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to develop and optimize the mesomorphic phase formulation for a meloxicam transdermal dosage form. A mixture design was applied to prepare formulations which consisted of three independent variables including oleic acid (X1), distilled water (X2) and ethanol (X3). The flux and lag time (LT) were selected as dependent variables. The result showed that using mesomorphic phases as vehicles can significantly increase flux and shorten LT of drug. The analysis of variance showed that the permeation parameters of meloxicam from formulations were significantly influenced by the independent variables and their interactions. The X3 (ethanol) had the greatest potential influence on the flux and LT, followed by X1 and X2. A new formulation was prepared according to the independent levels provided by RSM. The observed responses were in close agreement with the predicted values, demonstrating that RSM could be successfully used to optimize mesomorphic phase formulations. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd.

84860313484	A new antitumor agent, (3-chloro-7-methoxyfuro[2,3-b]-quinolin-4-yl)-(4-methoxyphenyl) amine, loaded in solid lipid nanoparticles: Characterization and pharmacokinetics	(3-Chloro-7-methoxyfuro[2,3-b]-quinolin-4-yl)-(4-methoxyphenyl)amine (CYL), a chemotherapeutic agent, is an analogue of amsacrine. The water insolubility of CYL limits its delivery and thus its application. The aim of the study was to utilize solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) to improve the delivery of CYL, and investigate its biodistribution behavior in an animal model. Characterizations of SLNs were evaluated including the particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency. An in vivo study was used to investigate the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution behaviors. We established a rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique with electrochemical detection to determine CYL, and the limit of detection was 40 ng/ml. We found that particle sizes of CYL-loaded SLNs were about 25%~33% larger then empty SLNs. The entrapment efficiency (E%) of CYL embedded in the SLN matrix was about 80%~98%. Moreover, the E% of SLNs incorporating glyceryl monostearate (GMS) significantly increased by about 11%~17% and the polydispersity index dropped 0.3~0.39. An in vivo pharmacokinetics study of intravenous CYL displayed linear plasma pharmacokinetics and fit a two-compartment model. The biodistribution behavior demonstrated that CYL-loaded tristearin(TS)- GMS SLNs mainly accumulated in the heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, and kidneys. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

0037139420	Transdermal iontophoresis of sodium nonivamide acetate: V. Combined effect of physical enhancement methods	The effect of iontophoresis combined with treatment of other physical enhancement methods such as electroporation, low frequency ultrasound, and erbium:YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser on the transdermal delivery of sodium nonivamide acetate (SNA) was examined in this present study. Iontophoresis increased the transdermal flux of SNA in vitro as compared to the passive diffusion without any enhancement. Furthermore, iontophoresis was always the most potent enhancement method for SNA permeation among the physical enhancement methods tested. Pulsing of high voltages (electroporation) followed by iontophoresis did not result in increased transport over iontophoresis alone. However, electroporation shortened the onset of transdermal iontophoretic delivery of SNA. Pretreatment of low frequency ultrasound (sonophoresis) alone on skin did not increase the skin permeation of SNA. The combination of iontophoresis and sonophoresis increased transdermal SNA transport more than each method by itself. The enhancement of drug transport across shunt routes and reduction of the threshold voltage in the presence of an electric field may contribute to this synergistic effect. Use of an erbium:YAG laser was a good method for enhancing transdermal absorption of SNA because it allows precise control of stratum corneum (SC) removal, and this ablation of SC could be reversible to the original normal status. The combination of laser treatment and iontophoresis also synergized the skin permeation of SNA, possibly due to a gradual drop in the electric resistance of the skin. The results in this present study point out that the choice of certain conditions with suitable physical enhancement methods can induce a synergistic effect on transdermal delivery of SNA during iontophoresis. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037173530	Effect of antioxidants and anti-irritants on the stability, skin irritation and penetration capacity of captopril gel	The effects of antioxidants and chelating agent on the stability of captopril in aqueous and semisolid were determined in this study. Then the influence of the combination of additives including antioxidants, anti-irritants and penetration enhancer on stability, skin irritation and penetration capacity of captopril in semisolid dosage form was investigated. In the stability study, the degradation of captopril followed the first-order kinetic. The chelating agent EDTA showed a potent stability effect and obviously increased the shelf-life up to 14-fold that of control gel. The anti-irritants such as clobetasol and diphenhydramine had potent inhibition irritation activity and the effect was not retarded by the addition of EDTA. Moreover, the captopril gel containing penetration enhancer, anti-irritants and chelating agent had a higher penetration capacity and the minimum therapeutic concentration could be obtained by applying about 13.24 cm

84870382536	Modification of polyethylene glycol onto solid lipid nanoparticles encapsulating a novel chemotherapeutic agent (PK-L4) to enhance solubility for injection delivery	Background: The synthetic potential chemotherapeutic agent 3-Chloro-4-[(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]furo[2,3-b]quinoline (PK-L4) is an analog of amsacrine. The half-life of PK-L4 is longer than that of amsacrine; however, PK-L4 is difficult to dissolve in aqueous media, which is problematic for administration by intravenous injection. Aims: To utilize solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve the delivery of PK-L4 and investigate its biodistribution behavior after intravenous administration. Results: The particle size of the PK-L4-loaded SLNs was 47.3 nm and the size of the PEGylated form was smaller, at 28 nm. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of PK-L4 in SLNs with and without PEG showed a high capacity of approximately 100% encapsulation. Results also showed that the amount of PK-L4 released over a prolonged period from SLNs both with and without PEG was comparable to the non-formulated group, with 16.48% and 30.04%, respectively, of the drug being released, which fit a zero-order equation. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of PK-L4-loaded SLNs with and those without PEG were significantly reduced by 45%-64% in the human lung carcinoma cell line (A549), 99% in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line with estrogen receptor (MCF7), and 95% in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MDA-MB-231). The amount of PK-L4 released by SLNs with PEG was significantly higher than that from the PK-L4 solution (P < 0.05). After intravenous bolus of the PK-L4-loaded SLNs with PEG, there was a marked significant difference in half-life alpha (0.136 ± 0.046 hours) when compared with the PK-L4 solution (0.078 ± 0.023 hours); also the area under the curve from zero to infinity did not change in plasma when compared to the PK-L4 solution. This demonstrated that PK-L4-loaded SLNs were rapidly distributed from central areas to tissues and exhibited higher accumulation in specific organs. The highest deposition of PK-L4-loaded SLNs with PEG was found in the lung and spine. Conclusion: Sufficient amounts of PK-L4 were entrapped in the SLNs, and the pharmacokinetic behavior of PK-L4-loaded SLNs was established. This formulation successfully resolved the delivery problem, and the drug was localized in particular organs. 2012 Fang et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84879582787	Effect of microemulsions on transdermal delivery of citalopram: Optimization studies using mixture design and response surface methodology	The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of microemulsions as a drug vehicle for transdermal delivery of citalopram. A computerized statistical technique of response surface methodology with mixture design was used to investigate and optimize the influence of the formulation compositions including a mixture of Brij 30/Brij 35 surfactants (at a ratio of 4:1, 20%-30%), isopropyl alcohol (20%-30%), and distilled water (40%-50%) on the properties of the drug-loaded microemulsions, including permeation rate (flux) and lag time. When microemulsions were used as a vehicle, the drug permeation rate increased significantly and the lag time shortened significantly when compared with the aqueous control of 40% isopropyl alcohol solution containing 3% citalopram, demonstrating that microemulsions are a promising vehicle for transdermal application. With regard to the pharmacokinetic parameters of citalopram, the flux required for the transdermal delivery system was about 1280 μg per hour. The microemulsions loaded with citalopram 3% and 10% showed respective flux rates of 179.6 μg/cm

84879584830	The transport effect of submicron emulsions on 5-flurouracil topical application	Water-in-oil submicron emulsions were used as carrier for the topical delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The effect of components such as level and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value of surfactant, type of cosurfactant, and drug concentration on the delivery capability of drug in the receptor fluid and in the various skin layers (stratum corneum, epidermis and dermis) were evaluated. The result showed the submicron emulsion could increase the transdermal and deposition of 5FU compared with the aqueous control. Submicron emulsion with surfactant at HLB of 6.0 had higher deposition amount of drug in epidermis layer. The deposition amount of drug in the skin layers increased with increased amounts of surfactant and drug loading of submicron emulsion. However, the 0.2% 5FU-load submicron emulsion showed a comparable deposition effect in various skin layers with the commercial product (5%, Efudix®), which indicated that the submicron emulsions could be a promising drug vehicle for topical application. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

0141961726	Chitin/PLGA blend microspheres as a biodegradable drug delivery system: A new delivery system for protein	Novel chitin/PLGAs and chitin/PLA based microspheres were developed for the delivery of protein. These biodegradable microspheres were prepared by polymers blending and wet phase-inversion methods. The parameters such as selected non-solvents, temperature of water and ratio of polylactide to polyglycolide were adjusted to improve thermodynamic compatibility of individual polymer (chitin and PLGAs or chitin/PLA), which affects the hydration and degradation properties of the blend microspheres. Triphasic pattern of drug release model is observed from the release of protein from the chitin/PLGAs and chitin/PLA microspheres: the initially fast release (the first phase), the following slow release (the second phase) and the second burst release (the third phase). Formulations of the blends, which are based on the balance among the hydration rate of the chitin phase and degradation of chitin/PLA and PLGA phase, can lead to a controllable release of bovine serum albumin (BSA). In conclusion, such a chitin/PLGA 50/50 microsphere is novel and interesting, and may be used as a protein delivery system. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84891559401	Anti-oxidant activity and attenuation of bladder hyperactivity by the flavonoid compound kaempferol	Objectives: To evaluate the anti-oxidant activity of the flavonoid compound, kaempferol, and to examine its role in the suppression of oxidative stress and attenuation of bladder hyperactivity in a rat model of bladder injury. Methods: The anti-oxidative activity of kaempferol was examined in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW264.7 macrophages by using flow cytometry. For invivo studies, rats were pretreated with kaempferol or vehicle for 24h. The rat urothelium was injured by the administration of protamine sulfate for 1.5h and irritated by the subsequent infusion of potassium chloride for 4h. Oxidative stress in the bladder tissue was assessed using chemiluminescence assay, and the bladder pressure was determination by cystomertrogram. Results: Kaempferol significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced reactive oxygen species production in RAW264.7 rat macrophages. Exposure of the rat bladder to sequential infusion of protamine sulfate and potassium chloride induced bladder hyperactivity. Pretreatment with kaempferol, prevented the formation of reactive oxygen species and prolonged the intercontraction interval. Conclusion: Kaempferol suppresses oxidative stress and attenuates bladder hyperactivity caused by potassium chloride after protamine sulfate-induced bladder injury. © 2013 The Japanese Urological Association.

1142309797	The characterization and biodistribution of cefoxitin-loaded liposomes	To conquer the clinical restriction of relative short half-life and poor tissue retaining activities, liposomes containing cefoxitin were prepared using three methods in this study. The physicochemical properties including cefoxitin encapsulation percentage, vesicle size, stability, as well as the in vivo biodistribution were studied. The highest entrapment percentage was observed by using reverse phase evaporation method, and the molar ratio of cefoxitin to phospholipids was 1:3, DMPC to cholesterol was 2:1, respectively. From the result of stability, the freeze-drying powder and then stored in the frozen condition of cefoxitin-loaded liposome was an ideal storage state. Accordingly, the formulation by reverse-phase evaporation method was selected to investigate the biodistribution of cefoxitin-loaded liposome and compared to free cefoxitin in rats. It was observed that the cefoxitin levels and the duration retained in the liver, spleen, and pancreas of liposome-injected animals were higher and longer than that of free cefoxitin-injected animals. The drug concentrations of bile after post-injection of liposomal cefoxitin at 0.5, 1 and 2h were all approximately 2.7 times higher than that of free cefoxitin injection group. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
