84928539188	A transonic compressor design methodology including the influence of 3D passage shock waves	Tbroughflow theory, as a design problem, is extensively used in the design of transonic axial flow compressors and fans. The losses caused by a simplified passage shock named shock loss model were taken into account in the design of transonic stages. However, the influences of shock waves on flow fields are still under development for transonic design. This problem is studied in the present paper. The basic equations of the throughflow method are re-derived under the concept of discontinuous passage averaging, and then, the distribution shock forces acted on the averaged throughflow fields are obtained. To evaluate these effects on averaged throughflow fields, a passage shock structure model is developed based on the previous models. Finally, the shock influences are assessed and compared in the present paper. It is demonstrated that the distribution shock forces have dramatically effects on the results of design.

84928567959	A helical surface model for 3-D shock structure analysis	This paper is Pan I of a comprehensive study on the blade leading edge sweep/bend of supersonic and transonic axial compressors. The objective of the paper is to develop an analytical shock surface model which links a blade leading edge with the 3-D shock structure, and can be eventually explored as a means to estimate the direct and indirect shock losses. The model surface is composed of helixes on a set of cylinders with aerodynamically determined ascendent for each helix. One kind of the relation between the ascendent and 2-D aerodynamics on SI stream surface has been established for a leading edge attached shock surface. The succeeding research has revealed that the concepts of a forward/backward swept shock surface, and their qualitative and quantitative natures, can be analysed by the model in uniformity. The model is constructed as such that it can also be used in the inverse method of design process. Two leading edge shock surfaces from two high loading transonic fans are simulated by the model.

9444225925	Frequency analyses for mechanism research of unsteady flow inside three dimensional compressor cascade	Numerical simulations are carried out for unsteady flow field of certain kind of 3D compressor cascade. Emphasis is laid on vortex shedding and frequency analysis in a compressor cascade. Numerical simulations using unsteady Reynolds-averaged viscous turbulent equations are carried out. The results show that the flows in separated areas and wake areas are characterized as periodic or quasi-periodic vortex shedding and the frequencies of vortex shedding vary with incidences and Mach number. At the same Mach number, the frequency of vortex shedding will decrease as the incidence increases. Yet, the frequency will increase as the Mach number increases at the same incidence. In the same computation case, the frequency of vortex shedding will vary along the span of blade. The frequency is smaller at the middle of the span than that at the hub.

0013406592	Spatipal transformation of the discrete sound field from a propeller	A technique for the spatial transformation of the discrete sound field from a propeller is proposed that is based on solving the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation with quadrupole source term neglected. Since the blade surface velocity is fully specified, numerical inversion of Farassat's integral is used to relate the blade surface pressures to the finite number of measurements in the acoustic field. With the reconstructed aerodynamic loading, the whole sound field is naturally predicted using Farassat's integral. Since the inverse problem is ill posed, the Tikhonov regularization method is used to stabilize the solution. The optimal regularization parameter is chosen by generalized cross-validation criterion. Numerical results show that the reconstruction is inaccurate in the presence of measurement noise (error) but the spatial transformation of discrete sound filed remains satisfactory.

0031358536	3D rotating stall stability model for axial flow compressor	Rotating stall phenomenon is usually characterized by 3D aerodynamic stability behavior. The earlier models mainly considered the flow effects in terms of 1D and 2D spatial variables. In order to involve the characteristics of the 3D flow of the compressor, it is necessary to improve the existing rotating stall stability models and further develop the models to consider the effects of the 3D disturbance. In this paper, a new aerodynamic stability model concerning the effects of a radial disturbance produced by the compressor, and explaining more mechanisms about the aerodynamic stability of compressor is presented. Using the developed rotating stall stability model, the stall margins are calculated and compared to experimental data for two axial flow compressors. The calculated results show that the developed 3D rotating stall stability model gives better stall margin prediction than that by the 2D model.

The model could be used to solve acoustic-elastic problems, such as calculating the added modal mass and loss factor induced by the interaction between the external sound field and fuselage structure. For demonstration of its application the intermodal coupling coefficients of a scaled fuselage model have been ascertained. For verification purposes the sound field radiated by a sphere with a cyclically vibrating surface has been calculated by this model. The results are coincident with those yielded by an analytical method. The calculation of sound power radiated by a static sphere source gives the model and the numerical method additional proof of their validity.

23844518976	Investigation on a type of flow control to weaken unsteady separated flows by unsteady excitation in axial flow compressors	By solving unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations discretized by a high-order scheme, the results showed that the disordered unsteady separated flow could be effectively controlled by periodic suction and blowing in a wide range of incidences, resulting in enhancement of time-averaged aerodynamic performances of an axial compressor cascade. The effects of unsteady excitation frequency, amplitude, and excitation location were investigated in detail. The effective excitation frequency spans a wide spectrum, and there is an optimal excitation frequency that is nearly equal to the characteristic frequency of vortex shedding. Excitation amplitude exhibits a threshold value (nearly 10% in terms of the ratio of maximum velocity of periodic suction and blowing to the velocity of free flow) and an optimal value (nearly 35%). The optimal excitation location is just upstream of the separation point. We also explored feasible unsteady actuators by utilizing the upstream wake for constraining unsteady separation in axial flow compressors. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.

26444560103	Interaction of unsteady separated flow over multi-bodies moving relatively in the same flow field	Unsteady separated flow is one of research frontiers in current aerodynamic. Great accomplishments have been acquired; however, most studies are on single body in a stream, such as studies on unsteady separated flows over airfoils. There are typical cases in the nature and engineering applications, in which several interacting bodies with relative motions are within the same flow field. These interacting unsteady separated flow fields not only are closely related to the phenomena of noise and flutter induced by flows, but also have strong influences on aerodynamic performances. With axial flow compressors as background, the present paper carried out studies on 'interaction of unsteady separated flow over multi-bodies moving relatively in the same flow field'. Experiment investigations carried out in the stationary annular cascade wind tunnel and the single-stage low-speed axial flow compressor experimental facility as well as relevant CFD simulations demonstrate that under properly organized interactions between all unsteady components, the time-space structure of unsteady separated flow field can be remarkably improved and the time-averaged aerodynamic performances be significantly enhanced accordingly. The maximum reduction of the loss coefficient reached 27.4% and 76.5% in the stationary annular cascade wind tunnel and the CFD simulation for single-stage axial flow compressor, respectively. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

27744484355	Compressibility effects on the two generations of unsteady flow types in axial flow compressors	There occurred unsteady separated flows inside axial flow compressors, which was however not taken into consideration in the present aerodynamic design system. This discrepancy indicates that the potential underlying unsteady separated flows is yet to be explored, hence the present research team proposes the concept of two generations of unsteady flow types, i.e. Unsteady Natural Flow Type (UNFT) and Unsteady Cooperative Flow Type (UCFT). Numerical simulations are carried out in the present paper to study the compressibility effect on the unsteady cooperative flow type in axial flow compressors. The studies show that aerodynamic performances are remarkably enhanced by means of transforming the flow type from UNFT into UCFT by imposing unsteady excitations. In the case of 2D subsonic cascade, performances are greatly improved in a wide range of Ma number (Ma<0.8) and the maximum relative reduction of the loss coefficient reaches 40.2%. In the case of 2D trans-supersonic cascade, positive effects can't be captured. However, in the case of a 3D trans-supersonic single rotor, the adiabatic efficiency is increased from 87.0% to 90.2%.

27744557895	Numerical simulation of wake impacting effect of axial flow compressor	By giving accurate inlet boundary condition of rotor to simulate the interaction between rotor and stator, the result of 3D unsteady numerical simulation to a row of rotor's flow field can reflect the effect induced by upstream unsteady wakes. Because the number of rotor's blades and stator's blades is difference, traditional numerical simulation usually can't accurately simulate the frequency of upstream unsteady excitation to downstream flow field. This difficulty can be solved by using this method. At the same time, the requirement of computational time and computational capability can be received. The result of numerical simulation to a low velocity axial flow compressor rotor shows that the aerodynamic performance of the rotor can be improved greatly if the deflected amplitude and frequency of upstream wakes were arranged reasonable. Therefore one kind of reasonable methods was presented to control and use unsteady flow in axial flow fan and compressor.

Unsteady excitations were utilized to trigger the transformation from the unsteady natural flow pattern into the unsteady cooperative flow pattern, resulting in increment of aerodynamic performances of axial compressor. Numerical simulations show that distinct positive effect can be obtained for the 2D cascade in a wide range of subsonic working conditions. No positive effect can be observed under the 2D supersonic working conditions and unsteady excitations have little influence on the flow field space-time structure. However, positive effect can be obtained under the 3D trans-sonic working conditions. In addition, engineering applications of unsteady cooperative flow type are discussed.

30744458109	Control of unsteady separated flows inside axial compressors by synthetic jets	By means of planar cascade wind tunnel experiments and relevant numerical simulations, synthetic jets have been used to control boundary layer unsteady separation from the suction side of a compressor airfoil. The reliability of the numerical simulations was validated by experimental results, and optimal analyses of various excitation parameters were carried out by means of numerical simulations. The excitation effects reached the best when the unsteady excitation frequency is equal to (or close to) the characteristic frequency of trailing edged vortex shedding, when the excitation was forced at the separation point and when the excitation direction was vertical to the profile. Generally, the larger the excitation amplitude, the better the excitation effects. The studies showed that this kind of unsteady excitation could regulate boundary layer evolution and development, promote the merging of small vortexes and enhance time-averaged aerodynamic performances in wide incidence, in which the loss coefficient decreases from 0.297 to 0.232 (δω̄=-21.9%), and the static pressure ratio increases from 1.058 to 1.103 (δp̄ =77.6%). Based on these optimal analyses, the discrepancy between the experimental and simulation results could be explained, and an improved experiment scheme was thereby put forward.

Moreover, because the intensity of vortex shedding in the wake of the guide vane is too weak, it's frequency has no influence on the vibration characteristics of the low-pressure compressor rotor.

33947524349	Process mechanism of synthetic jet and its effect on the mixing in coaxial jets	Two-dimensional unsteady numerical simulation was carried out to investigate the flowfields surrounding a synthetic jet actuator and its effect on the mixing in coaxial jets. The synthetic jet flowfield and the coaxial jets flowfield were investigated. The results show synthetic jet comprises a series of vortex pairs, which distribute around the centerline symmetrically. Its frequency keep same to the actuator's frequency. This is a disturbed force for the outer flowfield. The movement velocity of vortex pairs is nearly constant. The formation and development of the outer flowfield have the same rule as that of the inner flowfield. But they are opposite to each other at the certain moment. As a result of actuating device, the centerline velocity distribution shows that the amplitude decreases gradually, which represents the radical characteristic of vorticity development. The mixing ratio of coaxial jets increases comparatively because of the synthetic jet actuators, and the mixing effects in coaxial jets also become more agreeable.

A novel objective function of torque associated with BVF was used to optimize the blade configuration. The physical sources of separated flow could be probed on rotor blade through the BVF diagnosis, which was a novel diagnosis method based on local dynamics. The shock structure was showed clearly on the rotor blade in this diagnosis method. Although the torque of the optimized rotor was increased, the shock strength was decreased and the separated flow was controlled better, as the BVF distribution was better than before. The results of 3D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) analysis indicate that not only the total pressure ratio of rotor is increased by 7.69%, but also the adiabatic efficiency is increased by 1.92% too. The optimized rotor has a higher performance over a wide range of mass flow. The optimization method based on BVF can play an important role in the optimization design of fans/compressors.

34548720402	Optimization of highly loaded fan rotor based on throughflow model	This paper presents an optimization method for fan/compressor which couples throughflow model solving axisymmetric Euler equations with adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) algorithm. One of the advantages of this optimization method is that it spends much less time than 3D optimization due to the rapid solving of throughflow model. In addition, the optimization space is quite extensive because more design variables can be adjusted in throughflow phase, such as swirl distribution, hub curve and sweep. To validate this optimization method, a highly loaded fan rotor with pressure ratio of 3.06 as a baseline is optimized. During the optimization process, the objective function is total pressure ratio, moreover, mass flow and efficiency are selected as the constraint conditions. Three important design variables including swirl distribution, hub curve and sweep are parameterized using Bezier curve, and then optimized in throughflow model independently, finally the optimum designs are validated using 3D viscous CFD solver. It is shown that pressure ratio and rotor loading can be improved further through optimizing swirl distribution, however, hub and sweep curves take more effects on mass flow and efficiency respectively. The optimization results demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of this optimization method. Copyright © 2007 by ASME.

The circumferential vorticity is directly expressible by the circulation distribution which is the significant parameter in the throughflow compressor design.

The time-mean jeted flow rates are not more than 1% of the inlet mass flow rate. The results show that, by means of adding jets on the suction surface, the separated flow could be effectively controlled and the time-mean performance of flow field could be remarkably improved. The optimal jet direction varies with each type of jets. The most effective jet location is at a distance upstream of the time-mean separation point which distinguishes from that of unsteady jet. For a fixed slot width, the effectiveness of injection associates with the balance between injection velocity, or jeted flow rate, and blockage. There is an optimal frequency for the unsteady jet.

In throughflow design, swirl is prescribed according linear distribution along axial direction for one rotor, but cosine curve distribution for another rotor. 3D viscous analysis results show that the latter one has higher pressure ratio, efficiency and mass flow in peak efficiency point. Particularly the cosine curve distribution of swirl causes more pre-compression for the profiles of supersonic sections, which is of great benefit to weakening the intensity of shock wave and suppressing the flow separation after shock wave. The cosine type of swirl distribution along axial direction in throughflow design is more suitable for highly-loaded fan.

47049126437	Vorticity dynamics in axial compressor flow diagnosis and design	It is well recognized that vorticity and vortical structures appear inevitably in viscous compressor flows and have strong influence on the compressor performance. However, conventional analysis and design procedure cannot pinpoint the quantitative contribution of each individual vortical structure to the integrated performance of a compressor, such as the stagnation-pressure ratio and efficiency. We fill this gap by using the so-called derivative-moment transformation, which has been successfully applied to external aerodynamics. We show that the compressor performance is mainly controlled by the radial distribution of azimuthal vorticity, of which an optimization in the through-flow design stage leads to a simple Abel equation of the second kind. The satisfaction of the equation yields desired circulation distribution that optimizes the blade geometry. The advantage of this new procedure is demonstrated by numerical examples, including the posterior performance check by 3D Navier-Stokes simulation. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.

The explicit conceptions of transonic stator and the integral transonic fan/compressor stage are defined respectively. At least two differences in fan/compressor design between the transonic and the conventional methods can be summarized: the inlet Ma of stator hub is allowed to be higher than 1.0; the diffusion factor of stator hub ought to be limited below 0.53.

By means of investigation on the cascade performance variation with slot position, blowing angle and slot width, the best slot scheme is obtained. BVF aerodynamics analysis indicates that the high positive peak of BVF is a sign of large scale flow separation, BVF distribution and cascade performance are interrelated, the blowing can adjust BVF distribution well to improve the performance. The best slot position is located behind the positive BVF peak and in a small zone near separation point. By selecting an appropriate slot position, the best effect could be obtained in a wide operating range.

51149117382	Analysis of unsteady vortex sheet in 2-D axial compressor	The flowfield in turbomachinery is characterized by unsteady vortex flow. Contradictorily, the current analysis and design system of axial compressor is based on the spatial structure of the flowfield under the assumption of steady flow. It is understood that one of the methods to investigate the real flow inside the axial compressor is to analyze the temporal-spatial structure of the flowfield. In this paper, an axial compressor stage embedding interlaced rotor and stator rows was simplified into a single blade row, and then further into a 2-D compressor cascade. In this way, the temporal-spatial structure of the unsteady vortex flowfield could be described from the angle of unsteady vortex sheet of the cascade. For illustration, the temporal-spatial structure of the flowfield in cascade was transformed through controlling the evolution of vortex sheet by synthetic jet normal to the suction surface of the cascade. The presented unsteady vortex sheet model could be used as an analysis tool for further research on the temporal-spatial structure of stator/rotor interaction in multistage turbomachinery flowfield.

53649097441	Investigation on the concept and application of available stagnation pressure in the compressor	The aerodynamics design of compressor is definitely required for the flow direction, which, however, isn't considered in the definition of stagnation pressure. So, the limitation of stagnation pressure appears when describing the performance of unsteady flow in high load fan/compressor. In order to deal with this limitation, available stagnation pressure was presented to consider the influnence on working capability of small flow volume caused by its velocity value and flow direction. And, according to the design demand of flowing in fan/compressor, the concepts of available stagnation pressure and pressure difference coefficent were defined at the level of engneering aplication. The application of available stagnation pressure can reflect more effectively the influence of flow direction on unsteady flow field in turbomachinery, making the performance characters of flow field change more sensitive to the change of quality of flow field. So the available stagnation pressure is useful to analyze the unsteady flow field.

This model provides a simple method for 3-D unsteady numerical simulation under inlet circumferential distortion.

56849119570	Impact of lower reaction on high aerodynamic load transonic fan inlet stage	Lower reaction was concluded to be a necessary consequence of an increased aerodynamic load of a transonic fan/compressor inlet stage. Through the definitions of aerodynamic load coefficient and reaction, the rule of reaction changing with aerodynamic load coefficient was acquired, and two critical values of aerodynamic load coefficient were given. Based on a successfully designed and tested single stage high load fan, four transonic fan rotor designs were compared through numerical simulation. It was found that with the increase of aerodynamic load coefficient, the distribution of aerodynamic parameters in rotor hub region was changed remarkably. Transonic incoming flow to the stator is determined to be a problem in the design of a high aerodynamic load transonic fan inlet stage. Through discussions, it's considered that the problem of transonic incoming flow to the stator could be solved by existing design methods. The best design of the single stage fan was picked up, with its aerodynamic load coefficient reached 0.53, and its 3D viscous flow field was analyzed.

64049116100	Investigation of the effect of wake impact effect on vortex sheets of the downstream blade row in axial compressor	The flowfield in axial compressor is characterized by unsteady vortex flow due to the relative motion of the blade rows. The upstream unsteady wake flow changing periodically is responsible for the airfoil aerodynamic efficiency and thus for the overall performance of the aeroengine. This paper examines the influence of such unsteadiness of upstream wake impact on the development of vortex sheets of downstream blades in a highly loaded HPC (High pressure compressor). The results of this study indicate that the temporal-spatial structure of wake impact effect in multistage turbomachinery flowfield could be more deeply understood when the unsteady processes are considered through the interaction of respective vortex sheets. The results suggest that the performance change is corresponding with temporal-spatial structure of the flowfield. The vortex sheets interaction of upstream weak and downstream blades might reduce the loss. It is the frequency of the vortex shedding alternately at the trailing edge that couple with the upstream weak passing frequency, instead of the frequency of leading edge separated vortex instability.

77950846231	Effects of injection frequency on the rotor stall margin	The stall margin of compressor could be improved effectively by rotor tip injection, and the periodic injection is commonly used in the research. The purpose of this work is to investigate the influence of injection frequency on the rotor stall margin. An unsteady CFD code was employed to simulate the flow field of the rotor with injections of different frequencies. Comparing the stall margin of the rotor with injections of different frequencies, it is shown that there is an optimal injection frequency, around which the rotor stability enhancement is the largest. When the injection frequency is away form the optimal frequency, the improvement in stable flow range decreases correspondingly. For the rotor in this paper, the optimal frequency was 1.5 times the frequency of tip leakage vortex (for short, TLV) fluctuation. Time-averaged loading distribution at 98.5% span indicates that the loading of the rotor near the leading edge is decreased through injection with the optimal frequency, and therefore, the stall could be delayed. © 2010 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

77952176582	S-shaped compressor transition duct design based on wall pressure gradient control	A method for the parameterization of an S-shaped transition duct is presented. The midway offset ratio (MWOR), a parameter closely related to the curvature of the duct, is introduced, to enable the duct geometry to be expressed by only two independent parameters: MWOR and control-point area ratio (CPAR) in a selected axial position. Approaches of controlling the wall pressure gradient through MWOR and the area ratio is then investigated respectively. Finally, the method is applied to the design of a compressor transition duct to explore the design principle. The results show that larger values of MWOR tend to move the loading forward, while they decrease the adverse pressure gradient in the rear half of the inner wall where separation is likely to occur, thus reducing the loss. In addition, the area variation in an increase-decrease sequence along the duct, which can be controlled by CPAR, generates a mean pressure gradient counteracting that of the inner wall, and the integral pressure gradient can be further diminished. For the transition duct with equal area at its inlet and outlet, the loss is significantly decreased with the MWOR between 0.55 and 0.65, and CPAR around 1.1.

77958094527	Axisymmetric equivalent of S-shaped transition duct with struts in axial compression systems	Thick struts which intersect an S-shaped transition duct in an axial compression system tend to cause blockage in the flow passage and significantly influence the performance of the duct. As there are no design rules available for them, design of a transition duct with struts involves three dimensional numerical optimization, which is rather complicated. To simplify the issue in the design phase, an axisymmetric equivalent method which can reduce the problem to two dimensional problem is established. First, the theoretical concepts of axisymmetric equivalent method are presented based on the influence of struts on the pressure field in the duct. Then, the main features of the flow field in the equivalent duct and the strutted duct are compared through numerical calculation. It is shown that the endwall pressure distribution of the two ducts agrees well, and that they exhibit similar loss variation features, which both indicate that the equivalent duct is capable of capturing the major influence of struts. Finally, the equivalent method is applied to the optimization of a baseline strutted duct with separation in the strut-hub area due to high local diffusion. The optimized duct is found to have removed the separation completely, and decreased the loss by 41.6%.

This shows that the performance of stator will be improved on high blade loading while it varies little on low blade loading as the inlet wake angle increases. During the interaction of wake and boundary on high blade loading, increasing inlet wake angle will enhance the energy exchange between wake and boundary layer, which is a main factor to suppress the separated boundary layer and reduce the stator loss.

The calculated design speed performance of fan and high pressure compressor (HPC) shows that the design targets are achieved for mass flow, total pressure ratio and efficiency, while the stall margin of fan is only 7.8%, lower than the required value. Analysis of the flow field evolution shows that, during core nozzle throttling, the system instability is initiated in the exit stage of HPC; during bypass nozzle throttling, however, the large extent blockage, which is caused by the interaction of rotor tip vortex and passage shock, may contribute to the instability of the compression system.

The purpose of this paper is to explore a new type of injection, which is easy to implement in compressors without increasing the total weight. A casing modification (CM) method was used on the casing near the rotor tip leading edge, so that the axial velocity near rotor tip leading edge improved, which has a similar effect on the rotor tip injection. The method was numerically tested on the rotor 37, and it was concluded that, the CM method could improve the rotor stall margin by 6.7%, and the efficiency and pressure ratio are improved slightly. Comparison of different schemes of CM method shows that, the location of CM influences stall margin most obviously. The analysis of rotor tip flow field indicates that, the CM method could increase the rotor tip axial velocity, push the tip leakage vortex downstream, weaken the blockage at the rotor tip region, and enhance stability of the rotor therefore.

However, the compressor performance can be improved if the bleeding design is optimized. The model in this paper is a one-dimensional engine model based on air system bleeding. The relation between the compressor performance and the engine thermodynamic cycle caused by bleeding is analyzed to explore the potential of air system bleeding in improving compressor and engine performance. The results show that if bleeding brings an increase the pressure ratio of compressor, the negative impact on engine specific fuel consumption can be inhibited. If the efficiency of compressor is increased after bleeding, the negative impact on engine thrust can be alleviated. With proper bleeding flow rates, if both the pressure ratio and the efficiency increase at the same time, the negative impact on the engine performance can be eliminated. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.

84883736662	Forced response analysis of compressor blades under unsteady inlet distortion	Aircraft maneuver in high angle of attack can cause severe unsteady inlet distortion, which may induce forced response of compressor blades. Research on blade forced response is premise and basis for high-cycle fatigue life analysis. A compressor rotor blade is investigated with three-dimensional numerical simulation in fluid-structure coupling methods. Total pressure wake of inlet unsteady distortion is assumed as a sinusoidal function as parameters of turbulence intensity and excitation frequency. Different turbulence intensities and excitation frequencies are discussed in forced response analysis of rotor blades. The result demonstrates that turbulence intensity above 4% enhances the blade vibration level significantly. At 71.75% rotation speed, blade forced response is typically excited by dynamic total pressure distortion in 667Hz frequency, which is close to natural frequency of second flexural mode. Unsteady total pressure distortion induces increment of deformation and stress fluctuation. Although turbulence intensity and structure damping ratio are same compared with 667Hz, blade forced response level decreases and mechanical vibration energy of blade system is consumed by structure and aerodynamic damping in 286Hz excitation frequency. Inlet unsteady distortion in first to fourth engine order frequency does not induce significant forced response of compressor blades.

The flow field was studied numerically with and without inlet total pressure distortion. 3-D steady, unsteady numerical simulations have been conducted to determine the effects of circumferential total pressure inlet distortion on a transonic axial-flow compressor rotor. Overall performance (total pressure ratio, adiabatic efficiency and stable operating range) within inlet distortion has been investigated and compared with the results with clean inlet flow: Dropped in mass flow, adiabatic efficiency, and decreased in surge margin. Detail analyses of the flow field in the rotor show: Circumferential flow appears at the border of the distorted region, and flows inside to the distorted region. When entering the distortion, the blade passage faces a positive pre-swirl, on the countary, when leavinging the distortion, the blade passage faces a negative pre-swirl, which increases its incidence angle and loading. © 2013 IEEE.

Though the latter is now widely used in engineering design of turbomachinery, lots of cares must be taken of its effects in design process. It may be found that the time-averaged solutions, especially that with mixing interface method, sometimes give a false representation to the practical performance of the turbomachine, this is a disaster for engineering design problem. On the other hand, except inaccuracy due to scarcity of unsteady turbulence model and numerical error, time-accurate solution is a realistic approximation to practice. But its cost are two orders higher than time-averaged solution, moreover, how to understand and use the time-accurate results in day-to-day design is still impercipient up to now. So time-averaged design will hold its leading position for a long period till time-accurate design could go into practice, and more accurate time-averaged simulation is desired.

The results show that no oscillation occurs in tip flow field of rotor under high mass flow condition, which can be regarded as steady flow field for analysis, and the oscillation of tip leakage vortex is intensive under low mass flow conditions. Furthermore, periodical interference within the tip leakage flow between adjacent blade passages emerges. As a result, a phenomenon called "rotating instability" caused by the oscillation of tip leakage vortices and its circumferential propagation, is found in stationary frame. The dominating cell number of "rotating instability" flow field is nearly 40% of the blade passage number, and the cell size in circumferential direction is 2-3 pitches.

84905717598	Probing into the connotation of sweep aerodynamics of transonic fans and compressors	Theory researches, numerical analyses and experiment studies of sweep aerodynamics in turbo-machinery had rapidly developed during the 1990s. Taking a low-aspect-ratio, high-loaded axial flow transonic rotor as the baseline, this paper attempts to probe the connotation of sweep aerodynamics of transonic fans and compressors. The definition of sweep angle was discussed. Flow field, key factors that affect structures of flow fields, linkage between leading edges as well as flow field structures in swept rotors were presented. In order to find out the optimum sweep leading edge curve under prescribed conditions, a numerical optimization program that can be added into design processes was developed.

84906731044	Flutter analysis of turbomachinery based on phase lagged boundary condition	Based on phased lagged boundary conditions, an efficient aerodynamic damping computational model of a transonic compressor rotor with double passage was established. Numerical results of rotor aerodynamic performance, flutter boundary and blade modal analysis were consistent closely with experimental results respectively. The aerodynamic damping results of rotor with different interblade phase angles (IBPA) and first bending mode were calculated using double passage method and conventional multiple passage energy method. The numerical results indicated that the aerodynamic damping attained by double passage method and conventional multiple passage energy method agreed with each other. The efficiency was improved by almost 7.7 times than conventional multiple passage energy method and the memory requirement was about 0.45 times to the conventional method. The aerodynamic damping results for different vibration amplitudes demonstrates that the nonlinear fluid dynamics effects are significant at such a small geometric displacement. Compared with the damping at design point, aerodynamic damping of rotor is reduced at near flutter operation condition, while the minimum aerodynamic damping is gotten at the same interblade phase angle (-42.4 degree). The results show that IBPA has significant influence on the flutter of rotor blades.

84914162543	Affection of asymmetric IGV circumferential distribution on rotor in a low speed axial compressor	Theasymmetric Inlet guide vane (IGV) can increase the aerodynamic performance of the low speed axial compressor. Different circumferential distribution of IGV makes different effect. In this paper,a two-dimensional intermittent synthetic jet computational model based on unsteady cooperative flow (UCF) is made to explain this phenomenon. The result of computation indicate that the length of time between the jets is the key of the loss of flow. There must be a proper number of divisions for a asymmetric IGV. The result show that the angle of area without IGV Associated with the loss of the rotor. The asymmetric IGV make the downstream rotor different in dynamic response. An arbitrary circumferentially distributed IGV resonance model based on Fourier transform is built for the asymmetric IGV application in engineering. The result shows that the Campbell diagram of asymmetric IGV is quite different from the symmetric. There is three more frequency should be considered.

84914179780	Numerical study of the impact of rotor casing bleeding structure on the performance of an axial compressor	By studying the single-stage and low-speed axial compressor, the function of the compressor throttle plug is simulated by using the moving mesh to get a time-accurate numerical simulation on the compressor overall performance. Combined with experimental results, compressor flow field with and without air bleeding are compared to study the impact of different bleeding structures on compressor performance. The results show that casing bleeding can ease the blockage generated by the tip leakage flow. As a result, outlet deviation angle and relative total pressure loss of rotor are significantly decreased in the tip region. The compressor performance will be improved and the stall will be effectively postponed. The number of stall cells varies as the bleeding structure change. And the more the number of stall cells, the smaller range and strength of the stall cells.

0542369397	Solution of a sound field generated by the vibrating surface of a body moving at small Mach number	An approach to calculate the sound field generated by the Vibrating surface of a body with arbitrary shape moving at a small mach number has been developed by using acoustical analogy. A governing equation to calculate the sound pressure on the surface exited by its vibration has been derived on the basis of the united aerodynamics and aeroacoustics approach by Farassat and Long, and the sound field would be determinate. The cases relating to the sound sources of static sphere and moving compact pulsating sphere give a good check for the approach.

11144245303	3D numerical analysis for the effect between tip clearance and casing treatment in turbomachinery	The field in tip clearance of some compressor stator was simulated by Numeca computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the field in casing treatment slots. The results were compared and analyzed, the computation showed detail streamline in tip clearance and slots. By the casing treatment, the flow path was changed, the tip leakage eddy can be passed through, so the blockage of low incline streamline can be moderated. The field near the tip entered into the inclined slots by the high pressure from the tailing pressure side, then jetted into the field near the leading suction side. The jet fluid swept off the stalled flow, so the flow separated was postponed, the stable operating flow range was increased, and the quadratic flow loss was decreased. The high jet effect on main flow from momentum exchange may be the primary reason that slot casing improved the stable operating range.

0347588089	Research on sound-vortex resonance in enhancing performance of an annular cascade	This paper presents an experimental investigation on the effects of internal acoustic excitation on enhancing performance of an annular cascade. Based on the research on the shedding frequency characteristics of the annular cascade, the mechanism of interaction between the unsteady fluctuation and the separated flow in the annular cascade was systematically investigated by means of unsteady acoustic excitation. The experimental results reveal that the aerodynamic performance of turbomachinery would be improved amazingly if the unsteady interferences in the flow field could be reasonably organized. In experiment, the loss in one cascade passage could be reduced by nearly 30 percents. The optimal effect of the acoustic excitation was studied at different frequencies, intensities and positions of the excitation as well as at different flow incidence angles.

10244262853	Numerical investigation of wake impact effect in low-speed axial compressor	By using a Reynolds-averaged two-dimensional computation, the effect of upstream wake on unsteady separated flow field of downstream adjacent vanes was investigated in low-speed axial compressor. The results indicate that the generation of trailing-vortex of downstream adjacent vanes could be restrained effectively by upstream wake when the passing frequency and the amplitude of wake defect satisfy some conditions, associated with a significant enhancement of time-averaged aerodynamic performance: reducing loss coefficient by 40.2% and the ratio of loading coefficient and increasing loss coefficient by 93%. Thus, an approach was available to utilize the potentiality of intrinsic unsteady flow.

10244278043	Investigation on a type of flow control to weaken unsteady separated flows by unsteady excitation in axial flow compressors	By solving unsteady Reynolds-averaged 2-D N-S equations discretized by a high-order scheme, the results showed that the disordered unsteady separated flow could be effectively controlled by periodic suction and blowing in a wide range of incidence, resulting in enhancement of time-averaged aerodynamic performances. The effects of unsteady excitation frequency, amplitude and excitation location were investigated in detail. The effective excitation frequency spans a wide spectrum and there is an optimal excitation frequency that is nearly equal to the Characteristic frequency of vortex shedding. Excitation amplitude exhibits a threshold value (nearly 10% in term of the ratio of maximum velocity of periodic suction and blowing to the velocity of free flow) and an optimal value (nearly 35%). The optimal excitation location is just upstream of the separation point. We also explored feasible unsteady actuators by utilizing upstream wake for constraining unsteady separation in axial flow compressors.
