1542579906	Cloning and characterization of a novel splicing variant of the ZADH1 gene	We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel splicing variant of the human zinc binding alcohol dehydrogenase, domain containing 1 (ZADH1) gene. ZADH1 is localized on chromosome 14q24.2. The cDNA of this splicing variant is 1613 base pairs in length, and encodes a 351-amino acid protein with a putative molecular weight of 38.5 kDa. We named the novel splicing variant ZADH1b. By MTC-panel PCR analysis, it was found that ZADH1b was widely expressed in human tissues. Computer analysis revealed ZADH1 had a potential ADH_zinc_N domain and it had considerable homology with some dehydrogenases. It was speculated that ZADH1 may have definite metabolic roles in vivo as a dehydrogenase. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

18144386606	Co-administration of a DNA vaccine encoding the prostate specific membrane antigen and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides suppresses tumor growth	Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well characterized prostate-specific tumor associated antigen. Its expression is elevated in prostate carcinoma, particularly in metastatic and recurrent lesions. These observations suggest that PSMA can be used as immune target to induce tumor cell-specific recognition by the host and, consequently tumor rejection. We utilized a DNA-based vaccine to specifically enhance PSMA expression. An immune modulator, such as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides which promote Th1-type immune responses was combined to increase the efficacy of tumor recognition and elimination. Methods: A eukaryotic expression plasmid pCDNA3.1-PSMA encoding full-length PSMA was constructed. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with endotoxin-free pCDNA3.1-PSMA alone or in combination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides by intramuscular injection. After 4 immunizations, PSMA specific antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocyte reactivity were measured. Immunized C57BL/6 mice were also challenged subcutaneously with B16 cells transfected with PSMA to evaluate suppression of tumor growth. Results: Vaccine-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with B16 cells expressing PSMA could be induced with this treatment schedule. Immune protection was observed in vaccinated mice as indicated by increased tumor growth in the control group (100%) compared with the groups vaccinated with DNA alone (66.7%) or DNA plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (50%) respectively. Average tumor volume was smaller in vaccinated groups and tumor-free survival time was prolonged by the vaccination. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that specific anti-tumor immune response can be induced by DNA vaccines expressing PSMA. In addition, the suppression of in vivo growth of tumor cells expressing PSMA was augmented by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. This strategy may provide a new venue for the treatment of carcinoma of prostate after failure of standard therapy. © 2004 Ren et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

27144529044	DNA vaccine expressing PSMA elicits suppresses tumor cells	Objective: To construct DNA vaccine expressing PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen) and to investigate its suppression to tumor cells. Methods: An eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1-PSMA encoding fall-length PSMA cDNA was constructed, and was introduced into B16 cells to establish a PSMA-expressing murine melanoma B16-PSMA cell line. The C57BL/6 mice were immunized with DNA vaccine pCDNA3.1-PSMA by intramuscular injection. After four dosages of immunizations, splenocytes were isolated and stimulated by mitomycin-treated B16-cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release method. The immunized C57BL/6 mice were also challenged by transplanting B16-PSMA cells, tumor-free survival time and the growth rate of tumors were recorded to investigate the anti-tumor reaction. Results: DNA vaccine expressing PSMA elicited CTL reaction of splenocytes. After DNA vaccine immunization, tumor occurrence reduced and tumor-free time was prolonged. Although tumors developed in immunized mice, the growth speed of the tumors was markedly reduced. Histological examination showed that there was infiltration by lymphocytes in tumors from immunized mice, while this infiltration was less prominent in control group. Conclusion: DNA vaccine expressing PSMA induced specific cellular immune response and suppressed tumor cells, that may provide a potential alternative in the treatment of carcinoma of prostate.

33646415691	Administration of PUMA adenovirus increases the sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to anticancer drugs	Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal human tumors, characterized by relative chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Researchers have been seeking for multimodality to improve its outcome of therapy. PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) is a potent proapoptotic molecule that is rapidly induced in cells following DNA damage and is required for p53-induced apoptosis. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PUMA adenovirus against esophageal cancer cell lines (KYSE-150, KYSE-410, KYSE-510 and YES-2). Infection with Ad-PUMA (PUMA Adenovirus) resulted in the more powerful cytotoxicity in these cell lines compared with Ad-p53. Furthermore, we assessed the efficacy of a combined treatment with Ad-PUMA and anticancer drug (cisplatin, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, respectively) for these cells and found PUMA significantly increased the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer cells, which may result from more abundant apoptosis induction. Interestingly, Ad-PUMA was found to be more efficient than Ad-p53 in inhibiting cell growth and enhancing the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer cell lines irrespective of the p53 status. These results suggest that Ad-PUMA is a potent cytotoxic agent and could be a promising alternative in the cancer gene therapy in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. ©2006 Landes Bioscience.

32344439117	Interaction of Pin1 with Nek6 and characterization of their expression correlation in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma patients	The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is prevalently overexpressed in human cancers and is regarded as a new diagnostic and therapeutic target. Pin1 interacts with several proteins involved in cell cycle events in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Among them, NIMA (never in mitosis, gene A) was first identified to interact with Pin1. In this report, we found that Pin1 could interact with Nek6, one of the human NIMA-related kinases (Neks). This interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down assay, which was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, as well as immunofluorescence colocalization. We further studied Pin1 and Nek6 mRNA level in 40 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma cases, finding significant correlations between Nek6 and Pin1 mRNA expression levels in these samples. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

60649084999	Multi-slice CT contrast-enhanced presentations of advanced gastric cancer: Associations with histo-differentiation and expression of p53 and P-glycoprotein	Background: This study aimed to investigate multi-slice CT contrast-enhanced presentation of gastric cancer and its correlation with histo-differentiation and p53 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. Methods: Sixty-six patients with gastric cancer in the present study underwent a muliti-slice CT preoperative routine and dual-phase contrast-enhanced examination of the upper abdomen; postoperative specimens were used to determine histo-differentiation and the expression of p53 and P-gp. The correlation of med-slice CT. contrast-enhanced presentation with histo-differentiation and expression of p53 and P-gp was analyzed. Results: The dual-phase contrast-enhanced ratio (CER) was not correlated with the histo-differentiation of gastric cancer (P >0.05). Positive expression of p53 and P-gp was significantly higher in the cases of layered or heterogeneous enhancement than in the cases of homogenous enhancement (P <0.05). Positive expression of p53 was also correlated with the arterial phase CER, tumor size and lymph node metastasis (P <0.05), but not with infiltration thickness of the gastric wall, nor was it correlated with the portal phase CER (P >0.05). Positive expression of P-gp was only correlated with the portal phase CER (P=0.005). Conclusions: Differently enhanced pattern and CER of the arterial and portal phase in gastric cancer correlate with its different histo-differentiation and expression of p53 and P-gp respectively. In addition, tumor size and lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer relate to the expression of p53.

84861808686	High-throughput screening for anti-influenza A virus drugs and study of the mechanism of procyanidin on influenza A virus-induced autophagy	In this research, we have established a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform based on the influenza A virus (IAV) vRNA promoter. Using this HTS platform, we selected 35 medicinal plants out of 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and found that 7 examples had not been reported. After examining many previous reports, we found that Vaccinium angustifolium Ait., Vitis vinifera L, and Cinnamomum cassia Presl had a common active compound, procyanidin, and then determined the anti-IAV effect of procyanidin and explored its mechanism of action. With a plaque inhibition assay and a time-of-addition experiment, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the IAV replication at several stages of the life cycle. In the Western blot and EGFP-LC3 localization assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the accumulation of LC3II and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. In the RT-PCR and Western blot assays, we found procyanidin could inhibit the expression of Atg7, Atg5, and Atg12. Finally, by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation-fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer and the dissociation of the beclin1/bcl2 heterodimer. In conclusion, we have established an HTS platform and identified procyanidin as a novel and promising anti-IAV agent. © 2012 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

84876698248	Adenovirus-delivered angiopoietin-1 treatment for phosgene-induced acute lung injury	Context: Exposure to phosgene can result in an acute lung injury, leading to pulmonary edema and even death. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is a critical factor for vascular stabilization due to its ability to reduce endothelial permeability and inflammation. Objective: In this study, the histopathological changes of the lungs after exposure to phosgene and the effect of Ang1 treatment were examined. Materials and methods: Rats were exposed to phosgene gas at 8.33g/m for 5min. Ang1 overexpressing rats were established by an intravenous injection of adenovirus-Ang1 (Ad/Ang1). The histological changes of the lung were examined by Haematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining and fluorescence microscopy. The inferior lobe was used for the determination of the ratio of wet weight to dry weight of the lung. The concentration of cytokines in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The pathological analysis showed signs of inflammation and edema, evident from a significant increase in the number of leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the ratio of wet to dry weight of the lungs. The lung injury induced by phosgene was markedly reduced after the injection of Ad/Ang1. The increase of IL-1β and IL-17 and decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of phosgene-exposed animals were abolished by the administration of Ad/Ang1. Discussion and conclusions: Ang1 has the beneficial effects on phosgene-induced lung injury. The adenovirus-delivered Ang1 may have the potential as a novel approach for the treatment of the acute lung injury caused by phosgene gas inhalation in humans. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

84908012088	TAp73 promotes cell survival upon genotoxic stress by inhibiting p53 activity	p53 plays a key role in regulating DNA damage response by suppressing cell cycle progression or inducing apoptosis depending on extent of DNA damage. However, it is not clear why mild genotoxic stress favors growth arrest, whereas excessive lesions signal cells to die. Here we showed that TAp73, a p53 homologue thought to have a similar function as p53, restrains the transcriptional activity of p53 and prevents excessive activation of its downstream targets upon low levels of DNA damage, which results in cell cycle arrest. Extensive DNA damage triggers TAp73 depletion through ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of E2F1, leading to enhanced transcriptional activation by p53 and subsequent induction of apoptosis. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of p53 function and suggest that TAp73 keeps p53 activity in check in regulating cell fate decisions upon genotoxic stress.

43749112192	Anti-cancer effects of JKA97 are associated with its induction of cell apoptosis via a Bax-dependent and p53-independent pathway	p53, one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers, is thought to be associated with cancer development. Hence, screening and identifying natural or synthetic compounds with anti-cancer activity via p53-independent pathway is one of the most challenging tasks for scientists in this field. Compound JKA97 (methoxy-1-styryl-9H-pyrid-[3,4-b]-indole) is a small molecule synthetic anti-cancer agent, with unknown mechanism(s). In this study we have demonstrated that the anticancer activity of JKA97 is associated with apoptotic induction via p53-independent mechanisms. We found that co-incubation of human colon cancer HCT116 cells with JKA97 inhibited HCT116 cell anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice and also induced a cell apoptotic response, both in the cell culture model and in a tumorigenesis nude mouse model. Further studies showed that JKA97-induced apoptosis was dramatically impaired in Bax knock-out (Bax

48249116426	Protective effects of a compound herbal extract (Tong Xin Luo) on free fatty acid induced endothelial injury: Implications of antioxidant system	Background: Tong-Xin-Luo (TXL) - a mixture of herbal extracts, has been used in Chinese medicine with established therapeutic efficacy in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods: We investigated the protective role of TXL extracts on endothelial cells injured by a known risk factor - palmitic acid (PA), which is elevated in metabolic syndrome and associated with cardiovascular complications. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were preconditioned with TXL extracts before exposed to PA for 24 hours. Results: We found that PA (0.5 mM) exposure induced 73% apoptosis in endothelial cells. However, when HAECs were preconditioned with ethanol extracted TXL (100 μg/ml), PA induced only 7% of the endothelial cells into apoptosis. Using antibody-based protein microarray, we found that TXL attenuated PA-induced activation of p38-MAPK stress pathway. To investigate the mechanisms involved in TXL's protective effects, we found that TXL reduced PA-induced intracellular oxidative stress. Through AMPK pathway, TXL restored the intracellular antioxidant system, which was depressed by the PA treatment, with an increased expression of thioredoxin and a decreased expression of the thioredoxin interacting protein. Conclusion: In summary, our study demonstrates that TXL protects endothelial cells from PA-induced injury. This protection is likely mediated by boosting intracellular antioxidant capacity through AMPK pathway, which may account for the therapeutic efficacy in TXL-mediated cardiovascular protection. © 2008 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

52649172218	Highly efficient in vitro site-specific recombination system based on Streptomyces phage φBT1 integrase	The Streptomyces phage φBT1 encodes a site-specific integrase of the large serine recombinase subfamily. In this report, the enzymatic activity of the φBT1 integrase was characterized in vitro. We showed that this integrase has efficient integration activity with substrate DNAs containing attB and attP sites, independent of DNA supercoiling or cofactors. Both intra- and intermolecular recombinations proceed with rapid kinetics. The recombination is highly specific, and no reactions are observed between pairs of sites including attB and attL, attB and attR, attP and attL, or attP and attR or between two identical att sequences; however, a low but significant frequency of excision recombination between attL and attR is observed in the presence of the φBT1 integrase alone. In addition, for efficient integration, the minimal sizes of attB and attP are 36 bp and 48 bp, respectively. This site-specific recombination system is efficient and simple to use; thus, it could have applications for the manipulation of DNA in vitro. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

53249140333	Silencing alpha-fetoprotein expression induces growth arrest and apoptosis in human hepatocellular cancer cell	The expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a tumor-associated antigen, is silenced in normal adult hepatocyte but reactivated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To investigate the roles of AFP in the regulation of cell growth, we silenced AFP expression in the HCC cell line Huh7 by transfection of specific Stealth™ RNAi. After the transfection for 48 h, the expression of AFP gene was almost abolished, the cell proliferation was inhibited by 46.15%, and the number of cells undergoing early apoptosis was significantly increased to 63.93%. Inhibition of AFP expression also resulted in an increased in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of caspase-3. The results suggest that AFP may positively regulate cell proliferation by enhancing the apoptosis resistance via dysfunction of the p53/Bax/cytochrome c/caspase-3 signaling pathway in AFP-producing HCC cell line. As such, the knockdown of AFP gene should be further investigated in vivo as a novel approach to HCC treatment. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

54949116560	Relative expression of SOD and CAT mRNA and activities of SOD and CAT in grafted cucumber leaves under NaCl stress	Taking grafted and own-root cucumber (Junlv No. 3) plants as test materials, the changes of their leaf Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT mRNA relative expression, leaf SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT activities, leaf MDA content, and leaf electrolytic leakage under NaCl stress were studied. The results showed that under NaCl stress, grafted cucumber had a higher relative expression of its leaf Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT mRNA, and higher activities of its leaf SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT, compared with own-root cucumber, which suggested that the higher relative expression of Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT mRNA in grafted cucumber leaves resulted in the higher activities of their SOD, Cu/ Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT. With the NaCl stress prolonged, the relative expression of Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT mRNA in both grafted and own-root cucumber leaves had an increasing trend, but the changing trend of Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT activities were not the same as that of mRNA, indicating that the activities of SOD and CAT were also regulated by other factors. The leaf MDA content and electrolytic leakage of grafted cucumber were lower than those of own-root cucumber, suggesting that grafted cucumber had a higher scavenging metabolism, which could decrease oxidative damage and increase its salt-tolerance.

54049150816	SarA influences the sporulation and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor M145	The filamentous bacteria Streptomyces exhibit a complex life cycle involving morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism. A putative membrane protein gene sarA (sco4069), sporulation and antibiotic production related gene A, was partially characterized in Streptomyces coelicolor M145. The gene product had no characterized functional domains and was highly conserved in Streptomyces. Compared with the wild-type M145, the sarA mutant accelerated sporulation and dramatically decreased the production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that SarA influenced antibiotic production by controlling the abundance of actII-orf4 and redZ messenger RNA. © 2008 Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

60849136358	Lupeol, a dietary triterpene, inhibited growth, and induced apoptosis through down-regulation of DR3 in SMMC7721 cells	Lupeol (Lup-20(29)-en-3H-ol), a novel dietary triterpene, was found in fruits, vegetables, and several medicinal plants. Here, we investigated its growth-inhibitory effect and associated mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC7721 cells. Lupeol treatment resulted in significant inhibition of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death of this cell line with activation of caspase3 expression. Caspase8 inhibitor pretreatment was found to partially block the apoptosis induced by Lupeol. Moreover, Lupeol specifically caused a significant decrease in the expression of Death receptor 3 (DR3) mRNA and protein and a significant elevated expression of FADD mRNA whereas Fas mRNA and protein expression was not detectable. Further more, knockdown of DR3 by small interfering RNA inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cell. These results suggested that Lupeol treatment induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in SMMC7721 cells, the mechanism is due to down-regulation of DR3 expression. We demonstrated that Lupeol appears to be a promising chemopreventive agent for treating hepatocellular carcinoma, and DR3 may be an important target for liver cancer therapy.

63849138962	Characterization of rrdA, a TetR family protein gene involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor	Streptomyces not only exhibits complex morphological differentiation but also produces a plethora of secondary metabolites, particularly antibiotics. To improve our general understanding of the complex network of undecylprodigiosin (Red) biosynthesis regulation, we used an in vivo transposition system to identify novel regulators that influence Red production in Streptomyces coelicolor M145. Using this screening system, we obtained 25 Red-deficient mutants. Twenty-four of these mutants had a transposon inserted in the previously described Red biosynthetic gene cluster and produced different amounts of another secondary metabolite, actinorhodin (Act). One mutant was shown to have an insertion in a different region of the chromosome upstream of the previously uncharacterized gene rrdA (regulator redD, scoll04), which encodes a putative TetR family transcription factor. Compared with wild-type strain M145, the rrdA null mutant exhibited increased Red production and decreased Act production. A high level of rrdA expression resulted in a severe reduction in Red production and Act overproduction. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that RrdA negatively regulated Red production by controlling redD mRNA abundance, while no change was observed at the transcript level of the Act-specific activator gene, actII-orf4. The effects on Act biosynthesis might arise from competition for precursors that are common to both pathways. Copyright © 2009, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

68749083357	Production of double-stranded RNA for interference with TMV infection utilizing a bacterial prokaryotic expression system	In many species, the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces potent and specific gene silencing, a phenomenon called RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is the process of sequence-specific, posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in animals and plants, mediated by dsRNA homologous to the silenced genes. In plants, PTGS is part of a defense mechanism against virus infection, and dsRNA is the pivotal factor that induces gene silencing. Here, we report an efficient method that can produce dsRNA using a bacterial prokaryotic expression system. Using the bacteriophage λ-dependent Red recombination system, we knocked out the rnc genes of two different Escherichia coli strains and constructed three different vectors that could produce dsRNAs. This work explores the best vector/host combinations for high output of dsRNA. In the end, we found that strain M-JM109 or the M-JM109lacY mutant strain and the vector pGEM-CP480 are the best choices for producing great quantities of dsRNA. Resistance analyses and Northern blot showed that Tobacco mosaic virus infection could be inhibited by dsRNA, and the resistance was an RNA-mediated virus resistance. Our findings indicate that exogenous dsRNA could form the basis for an effective and environmentally friendly biotechnological tool that protects plants from virus infections. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

70349633673	Activation of the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway reduces fatty acid-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species by upregulating thioredoxin	OBJECTIVE - Oxidative stress induced by free fatty acids contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases in patients with metabolic syndrome. Reducing oxidative stress may attenuate these pathogenic processes. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been reported to reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The thioredoxin (Trx) system is a major antioxidant system. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the AMPK-mediated regulation of Trx expression and the reduction of intracellular ROS levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We observed that activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) significantly reduced ROS levels induced by palmitic acid in human aortic endothelial cells. Activation of AMPK increased expression of the antioxidant Trx, which mediated the ROS reduction. RT-PCR showed that AMPK regulated Trx at the transcriptional level. RESULTS - Forkhead transcription factor 3 (FOXO3) was identified as the target transcription factor involved in the upregulation of Trx expression. FOXO3 bound to the Trx promoter, recruited the histone acetylase p300 to the Trx promoter, and formed a transcription activator complex, which was enhanced by AICAR treatment. AMPK activated FOXO3 by promoting its nuclear translocation. We further showed that AICAR injection increased the expression of Trx and decreased ROS production in the aortic wall of ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. CONCLUSIONS - These results suggest that activation of the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway reduces ROS levels by inducing Trx expression. Thus, the AMPK-FOXO3-Trx axis may be an important defense mechanism against excessive ROS production induced by metabolic stress and could be a therapeutic target in treating cardiovascular diseases in metabolic syndrome. © 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.

76749168032	JNK-ATF-2 inhibits thrombomodulin (TM) expression by recruiting histone deacetylase4 (HDAC4) and forming a transcriptional repression complex in the TM promoter	Thrombomodulin (TM) is an important vascular protective molecule that has anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. TM is downregulated in many thrombotic and vascular diseases. However, the mechanisms responsible for TM suppression are not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism involved in fatty acid-induced suppression of TM expression in human aortic endothelial cells. We found that palmitic acid inhibited TM expression through the JNK and p38 pathways. ATF-2, a JNK and p38 target transcription factor, was involved in the suppression. ATF-2 can bind to the TM promoter, recruit HDAC4 and form a transcriptional repression complex in the promoter, which may lead to chromatin condensation and transcriptional arrest. This study provides novel insight into TM down-regulation by stress signaling pathways.

76249089202	Protective effects of ulinastatin on phosgene-induced acute lung injury and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha	Objective: To observe the effects of ulinastatin on the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the lung tissues of rats with acute lung injury induced by phosgene, and to explore the mechanism of ulinastatin in treating acute lung injury. Method: Sixty-four clean grade healthy male SD rats were randomly divided (random number) into eight groups with eight in each group. Group A1 in which rats were exposed to air. Group A2 in which rats wereexposed to air and treated with saline. Group A3 in which rats were exposed to air and treated with dexamethasone. Group A4 in which rats were exposed to air and treated with ulinastatin. Group B1 in which rats were exposed to phosgene without treatment. Group B2 in which rats were exposed to phosgene and treated with saline. Group B3 in which rats were exposed to phosgene and treated with dexamethasone. Group B4 in which rats were exposed to phosgene and treated with ulinastatin. The expressions of TNF-α in the lung tissues were measured by using immunohistocheistry. Lung tissues were observed grossly and under 200-fold light microscope to identify the positive expressions in kytoplasm. Results: In group B1 and group B2, the wet weight, dry weight and wet/dry weight ratio og right lower lobe of lung were higher than those in group A1 and group A4(P < 0.01) , and those in group B4 and group B3 were significantly lower than those in group Bl (P < 0.01) , but still higher than those in group A1 and A4 (P < 0.01). The gross observation suggested that the surfaces of lung tissues in group Aland group A2 were slick and rose pink without congestion, dropsy or infarction; the surfaces of lung tissue in groups B1 and B2 appeared with congestion, dropsy and many petechia. The surfaces of lung tissue in groups B3 and B4 were similar to those in groups B1 and B2. Under the light microscope, the structure of lungs in groups A1 and A2 were clear without congestion, effusion or inflammatory cell infiltration. In groups B1 and B2, the engorgement of lung capillary vessels, congestion and tiny thrombosis were found and there abundant edematous fluid and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung stroma and alveolus with focal pulmonary atelectasis in some lung tissue section. The tissues in groups B3 and B4 showed congestion, dropsy, tiny thrombosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, but these changes were slighter than those in groups B1 and B2. The expressions of TNF-α in groups B1, B2, B3, and B4 were significantly higher thanthose in groups A1 and A2(P < 0.01), but the expressions of TNF-α IN group B4 was lower than that in groups B1 and B2 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Ulinastatin could lessen the lung injury by reducing the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.

77249107739	Metformin reduces lipid accumulation in macrophages by inhibiting FOXO1-mediated transcription of fatty acid-binding protein 4	Objective: The accumulation of lipids in macrophages contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Strategies to reduce lipid accumulation in macrophages may have therapeutic potential for preventing and treating atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications. The antidiabetic drug metformin has been reported to reduce lipid accumulation in adipocytes. In this study, we examined the effects of metformin on lipid accumulation in macrophages and investigated the mechanisms involved. Methods and results: We observed that metformin significantly reduced palmitic acid (PA)-induced intracellular lipid accumulation in macrophages. Metformin promoted the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), while reduced the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) which was involved in PA-induced lipid accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that metformin regulates FABP4 expression at the transcriptional level. We identified forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 as a positive regulator of FABP4 expression. Inhibiting FOXO1 expression with FOXO1 siRNA significantly reduced basal and PA-induced FABP4 expression. Overexpression of wild-type FOXO1 and constitutively active FOXO1 significantly increased FABP4 expression, whereas dominant negative FOXO1 dramatically decreased FABP4 expression. Metformin reduced FABP4 expression by promoting FOXO1 nuclear exclusion and subsequently inhibiting its activity. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that metformin reduces lipid accumulation in macrophages by repressing FOXO1-mediated FABP4 transcription. Thus, metformin may have a protective effect against lipid accumulation in macrophages and may serve as a therapeutic agent for preventing and treating atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77949539947	IRF-1 transcriptionally upregulates PUMA, which mediates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in IRF-1-induced apoptosis in cancer cells	Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that acts as a tumor suppressor and causes apoptosis in cancer cells. We evaluated IRF-1-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cell lines. We established stable clones in AGS cells that have a tetracycline-inducible IRF-1 expression system. We used these clones and recombinant adenovirus expressing IRF-1 to explore the mechanism of IRF-1-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer. Expression of IRF-1 causes apoptosis in gastric cancer cell lines as shown by phosphatidylserine exposure and cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, and Bid with the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. However, inhibition of caspase-8 and Bid did not inhibit apoptosis and did not decrease cleaved caspase-9 or mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. We then show that IRF-1 upregulates PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), which is known to activate apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway; this can be p53-independent. IRF-1 binds to distinct sites in the promoter of PUMA and activates PUMA transcription. Moreover, molecular markers of mitochondrial apoptosis are eliminated in PUMA knockout and knockdown cells and phosphatidylserine exposure is decreased dramatically. Finally, we show that IFN-γ induces IRF-1-mediated upregulation of PUMA in cancer cells. We conclude that IRF-1 can induce apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway independent of the extrinsic pathway by upregulation of PUMA. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

To understand themolecular mechanismof amino acids and carbohydratemetabolismin Malus hupehensis Rehd. var. pinyiensis Jiang (Pingyi Tiancha, PYTC), a full-length cDNA clone encoding homologue of SnRK1 was isolated from PYTC by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE). The clone, designated as MhSnRK1, contains 2063 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 1548 nucleotides. The deduced 515 amino acids showed high identities with other plant SnRK1 genes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed this gene was expressed in roots, stems and leaves. Exposing seedlings to nitrate caused and initial decrease in expression of the MhSnRK1 gene in roots, leaves and stems in short term. Ectopic expression of MhSnRK1 in tomato mainly resulted in higher starch content in leaf and red-ripening fruit than wildtype plants. This result supports the hypothesis that overexpression of SnRK1 causes the accumulation of starch in plant cells. All the results suggest that MhSnRK1 may play important roles in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

77951753647	Deletion of Puma protects hematopoietic stem cells and confers long-term survival in response to high-dose γ-irradiation	Molecular paradigms underlying the death of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) induced by ionizing radiation are poorly defined. We have examined the role of Puma (p53 up-regulated mediator of apoptosis) in apoptosis of HSCs after radiation injury. In the absence of Puma, HSCs were highly resistant to γ-radiation in a cell autonomous manner. As a result, Puma-null mice or the wild-type mice reconstituted with Puma-null bone marrow cells were strikingly able to survive for a long term after high-dose γ-radiation that normally would pose 100% lethality on wild-type animals. Interestingly, there was no increase of malignancy in the exposed animals. Such profound beneficial effects of Puma deficiency were likely associated with better maintained quiescence and more efficient DNA repair in the stem cells. This study demonstrates that Puma is a unique mediator in radiation-induced death of HSCs. Puma may be a potential target for developing an effective treatment aimed to protect HSCs from lethal radiation. © 2010 by The American Society of Hematology.

77952741468	Metformin reduces intracellular reactive oxygen species levels by upregulating expression of the antioxidant thioredoxin via the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway	Background: Oxidative stress induced by free fatty acids plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in patients with metabolic syndrome. Reducing oxidative stress in these patients may prevent cardiovascular complications. The antidiabetic agent metformin has been reported to directly protect the cardiovascular system. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin on the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by palmitic acid (PA) in human aortic endothelial cells and studied the molecular mechanisms involved. Methods and results: We observed that metformin significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels induced by PA. Additionally, metformin increased the expression of the antioxidant thioredoxin (Trx), which mediated metformin's effects on ROS reduction. Metformin increased Trx expression through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Metformin-regulated Trx at the transcriptional level and forkhead transcription factor 3 (FOXO3) was involved in this process. Conclusion: These results suggest that metformin reduces ROS levels by inducing Trx expression through activation of the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77953288101	Hypoxia induces PGC-1α expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium of TOF patients	PGC-1α, a potent transcriptional coactivator, is the major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity in the cardiac muscle. The dysregulation of PGC-1α and its target genes has been reported to be associated with congenital and acquired heart diseases. By examining myocardium samples from patients with Tetralogy of Fallot, we show here that PGC-1α expression levels are markedly increased in patients compared with healthy controls and positively correlated with the severity of cyanosis. Furthermore, hypoxia significantly induced the expression of PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured cardiac myocytes. Mechanistic studies suggest that hypoxia-induced PGC-1α expression is regulated through the AMPK signaling pathway. Together, our data indicate that hypoxia can stimulate the expression of PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis in the cardiac myocytes, and this process might provide a potential adaptive mechanism for cardiac myocytes to increase ATP output and minimize hypoxic damage to the heart. © 2010 IBCB, SIBS, CAS.

77953437721	Expression profile of microRNA in epithelial cancer: Diagnosis, classification and prediction	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the small non-coding RNAs, regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Up to one-third of human messenger RNAs (mRNAs) appear to be miRNA targets. Each miRNA can target hundreds of mRNA transcripts and production of proteins directly or indirectly, while more than one miRNA can converge on a single transcript target. Therefore, potential regulatory circuitries afforded by miRNAs are enormous. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs act as key regulators of various fundamental biological processes, in which common pathways are shared with cancer. Objective/methods: To provide an overview of the potential application of miRNA profile in human epithelial cancer diagnosis, more than 180 miRNA-related publications have been reviewed. Conclusion: Increasing evidence shows that the expression of miRNAs is remarkably deregulated in human cancer owing to multiple epigenetic and genomic alterations, and several miRNAs have been demonstrated to serve as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes in cancer. The deregulated miRNA expression profile in human cancer may prove a powerful tool for cancer detection, diagnosis, classification and prognosis. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.

77954023724	Development of two-dimensional micro strong cation exchan liquid chromatography/reversed phase pressurized capillary electrochromatography and its application on Cortex Phellodendri extract	Pressurized capillary electrochromatography (pCEC) combines capillary electrophoresis (CE) with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), resulting in high separation efficiency, high selectivity, high resolution and fast speed. In addition it provides a solvent gradient capability. Based on pCEC, a two-dimensional chromatography was constructed using micro strong cation exchange liquid chromatography and reversed phase pressurized capillary electrochromatography (μ-SCXLC/RP-pCEC) for the analysis of Cortex Phellodendri extract. A sample was separated by the first dimensional SCX column with a linear salt gradient elution into 11 plugs. Each plug was collected and injected into the second dimensional RP-pCEC column with a linear gradient for further separation. Compared with one-dimensional liquid chromatography it has higher resolution and larger peak capacity. The two-dimensional chromatographic system is suitable for the separation and analysis of complex samples.

77956302698	Distinct expression levels and patterns of stem cell marker, aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1), in human epithelial cancers	Aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1) has been proved useful for the identification of cancer stem cells. However, our knowledge of the expression and activity of ALDH1 in common epithelial cancers and their corresponding normal tissues is still largely absent. Therefore, we characterized ALDH1 expression in 24 types of normal tissues and a large collection of epithelial tumor specimens (six cancer types, n = 792) by immunohistochemical staining. Using the ALDEFUOR assay, ALDH1 activity was also examined in 16 primary tumor specimens and 43 established epithelial cancer cell lines. In addition, an ovarian cancer transgenic mouse model and 7 murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed. We found that the expression levels and patterns of ALDH1 in epithelial cancers are remarkably distinct, and they correlate with their corresponding normal tissues. ALDH1 protein expression levels are positively correlated with ALDH1 enzymatic activity measured by ALDEFLUOR assay. Long-term in vitro culture doesn't significantly affect ALDH1 activity in epithelial tumor cells. Consistent with research on other cancers, we found that high ALDH1 expression is significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes in serous ovarian cancer patients (n = 439, p = 0.0036).

78649684224	PUMA induction by FoxO3a mediates the anticancer activities of the broad-range kinase inhibitor UCN-01	Most targeted anticancer drugs are inhibitors of kinases that are aberrantly activated in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which kinase inhibitors suppress tumor growth remain unclear. In this study, we found that UCN-01, a staurosporine analogue and broad-range kinase inhibitor used in clinical trials, inhibits colon cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis via PUMA, a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member and a p53 target. PUMA expression was markedly elevated in a p53-independent fashion following UCN-01 treatment. The induction of PUMA by UCN-01 was mediated by direct binding of FoxO3a to the PUMA promoter following inhibition of AKT signaling. Deficiency in PUMA abrogated UCN-01-induced apoptosis, caspase activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and rendered UCN-01 resistance in a clonogenic assay, whereas elevated PUMA expression or a BH3 mimetic sensitized UCN-01 induced apoptosis. Chemosensitization by UCN-01 seemed to involve simultaneous PUMA induction through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, deficiency in PUMA suppressed the antitumor effects of UCN-01 in a xenograft model, concurrent with reduced apoptosis and caspase activation in vivo. These results suggest that PUMA-mediated apoptosis is pivotal for the anticancer activities of UCN-01, and possibly other clinically used kinase inhibitor drugs, and that PUMA manipulation may be useful for improving their anticancer activities. ©2010 AACR.

Chromatographic separation of SPRC and its internal standard (IS) was performed using a commercial analytical column which contained both C18 bonded silica particles and sulfonic acid cation-exchange particles. The optimized mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile/ammonium acetate buffer (10. mM, pH 4): 30/70 (v/v). Quantification was conducted by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of the transitions of m/z 160.0 → 143.0 for SPRC and 178.1 → 160.9 for S-butyl-cysteine (IS). The assay utilized methanol to achieve a simple and fast deproteinization. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.6 μg/mL (diluted with 50-fold of methanol) using 20 μL rat plasma. The assay was linear over a range from 0.6 to 159 μg/mL, with intra- and inter-batch accuracy (as relative error) less than ±5% and precision (as relative standard deviation) less than 10%. Using the validated assay, the pharmacokinetic properties of SPRC in rats were investigated. SPRC exhibits linear pharmacokinetics after oral or intravenous administration in rats. The bioavailability after oral administration at 25, 75, and 225. mg/kg was 96.6%, 97.0%, and 94.7%, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

HIV-RNA viral load was determined in the 48th week of cART. In total, 42 subjects were recruited and grouped according to their mean concentration of EFV during the study period: groups A, B and C with EFV concentrations (mean) <2 mg/L (1.8 mg/L), 2-4 mg/L (2.9 mg/L) and >4 mg/L (5.5 mg/L), respectively. The CD4 cell counts in group C increased more quickly than in groups B and A, although this was not statistically significant (211±176/μL versus 151± 145/μL and 172±105/μL, respectively; P = 0.799). Groups B and C had higher rates of HIV viral load suppression than group A (P = 0.017). For treatment-naïve Chinese HIV-infected patients, EFV plasma concentrations above 2 mg/L appear to suppress HIV replication more effectively than concentrations below 2 mg/L.

79551707420	A preliminary study on correlations of triple-phase multi-slice CT scan with histological differentiation and intratumoral microvascular/lymphatic invasion in gastric cancer	Many studies have shown that cancer cell differentiation and microvascular invasion play a principle role in cancer progression and metastasis, and non-invasive imaging techniques such as CT, MRI and US assessing the differentiation and the surgical resectibility and the prognosis of cancers are now of great importance. This study aimed to explore the correlation of triple-phase multi-slice CT scan with the histological differentiation and intratumor microvascular/lymphatic invasion of progressive gastric cancer. Methods The present study included 64 patients with gastric cancer, all of whom underwent routinal and dual-phase contrast enhancement multi-slice CT examinations of the upper abdomen before surgery. The post-operative specimens were used for determination of histological differentiation, cancer cell invasion of intratumoral microvascular/lymphatic vessel identified by CD34 and D2-40 expression. Correlations between contrast enhancement ratio (CER) of triple-phase multi-slice CT scan in gastric cancer and histological differentiation as well as intratumoral microvascular/lymphatic invasion were compared and analyzed. Results There was a significant correlation between CER of triple-phase CT scan in gastric cancer and tumor histological differentiation (P <0.05). CER of the arterial phase in gastric cancer with intratumoral microvascular invasion was significantly higher than that without invasion (0.61±0.28 vs. 0.46±0.14, P <0.05); CER of the arterial-parenchymal phase was significantly lower in gastric cancer with intratumoral microvascular invasion than that without invasion (1.81±0.39 vs. 2.28±0.80, P <0.05). However, CER of the parenchymal phase in gastric cancer with intratumoral lymphatic invasion was significantly higher than that without invasion (1.25±0.57 vs. 1.00±0.35, P <0.05). Conclusions CER of triple-phase multi-slice CT scan in gastric cancer is closely correlated with intratumoral microvascular and lymphatic invasion, and also could be used as a marker for histological differentiation.

79951486698	DNA cleavage is independent of synapsis during streptomyces phage Φ BT1 integrase-mediated site-specific recombination	Bacteriophage-encoded serine recombinases have great potential in genetic engineering but their catalytic mechanisms have not been adequately studied. Integration of Φ BT1 and Φ C31 via their attachment (att) sites is catalyzed by integrases of the large serine recombinase subtype. Both ΦBT1 and ΦC31 integrases were found to cleave single-substrate att sites without synaptic complex formation, and ΦBT1 integrase relaxed supercoiled DNA containing a single integration site. Systematic mutation of the central att site dinucleotide revealed that cleavage was independent of nucleotide sequence, but rejoining was crucially dependent upon complementarity of the cleavage products. Recombination between att sites containing dinucleotides with antiparallel complementarity led to antiparallel recombination. Integrase-substrate pre-incubation experiments revealed that the enzyme can form an attP-integrase tetramer complex that then captures naked attB DNA, and suggested that two alternative assembly pathways can lead to synaptic complex formation. © The Author (2010).

Samples were fractionated by the first-dimension μ-SCXLC with a linear solvent gradient and then injected into the second-dimension RP-pCEC for further separation. The μ-SCXLC/RP-pCEC 2-D system with three separation mechanisms, namely strong cation-exchange, reversed-phase chromatography and electrophoresis, provided high selectivity, high resolution and high peak capacity compared to one-dimensional chromatographic approaches. Separation effectiveness of this 2-D system was demonstrated by the analysis of different kinds of complex samples, such as traditional Chinese medicine Cortex Phellodendri, bovine serum albumin (BSA) tryptic digest and real serum tryptic digest.

79955906744	Posttranscriptional mechanisms in controlling eukaryotic circadian rhythms	The circadian clock is essential in almost all living organisms to synchronise biochemical, metabolic, physiological and behavioural cycles to daily changing environmental factors. In a highly conserved fashion, the circadian clock is primarily controlled by multiple positive and negative molecular circuitries that control gene expression. More recently, research in Neurospora and other eukaryotes has uncovered the involvement of additional regulatory components that operate at the posttranslational level to fine tune the circadian system. Though it remains poorly understood, a growing body of evidence has shown that posttranscriptional regulation controls the expression of both circadian oscillator and output gene transcripts at a number of different steps. This regulation is crucial for driving and maintaining robust circadian rhythms. Here we review recent advances in circadian rhythm research at the RNA level. © 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The column was a TSKgel ODS-100V. The mobile phase was ACN/aqueous solution of 15 mM ammonium acetate adjusted with TFA to pH 3.0 (2:98 v/v), in an isocratic mode. The drift tube temperature was set at 50°C and the nebulizing gas flow rate of air was 3.5 L/min for ELSD detection. Almost all of the reported degradation compounds of spectinomycin such as actinamine, actinospectinoic acid and biosynthesis intermediates such as dihydrospectinomycin diastereoisomers were baseline separated. MS was utilized for the identification of spectinomycin and its seven related substances. The method for the assay of spectinomycin was successfully validated with respect to accuracy, precision (RSD less than 2%), linearity (throughout the linear range 0.025-3 mg/mL, r=0.9993), sensitivity (LOD: 100 ng on column) and robustness. The experimental results demonstrated that the simultaneous determination of chloride, spectinomycin and related substances is feasible in a single run, which suggests applicability in routine assays. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

80051689473	Role of Smac in determining the chemotherapeutic response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Purpose: Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) regulates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Smac mimetics have been tested in clinical trials as chemosensitizers. We determined the role of Smac in modulating the chemosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Experimental Design: Smac expression was evaluated in tissues from ESCC patients with differential chemotherapeutic responses. The effects of Smac knockdown and Smac mimetics on the chemosensitivity of ESCC cells and the molecular mechanisms by which Smac and Smac mimetics modulate chemosensitivity were determined. The therapeutic responses of ESCC cells with different Smac statuses were compared using xenograft models. Results: We found that Smac was significantly downregulated in most ESCC samples (36.8%, 25/68, P = 0.001), and Smac expression differed significantly (P < 0.05) between chemosensitive and chemoresistant tumors. The associations of tested factors and their responses were examined using logistic regression analysis. In ESCC cells treated with cisplatin, a common chemotherapeutic drug, Smac and cytochrome c were released from mitochondria, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 were activated. Knockdown of Smac abrogated cisplatin-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Smac deficiency also reduced the effect of cisplatin on long-term cell viability, and led to cisplatin resistance in xenograft tumors in vivo. LBW242, a small molecule Smac mimetic, enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis and caspase activation and restored cisplatin sensitivity in Smac-deficient cells. Conclusion: Our data suggested that downregulation of Smac may be a chemoresistance mechanism in ESCC. Combinations of Smac mimetics with chemotherapeutic agents may have therapeutic benefits for the treatment of esophageal cancer. ©2011 AACR.

Efficient identification of oncomirs remains a challenge. Here we report a novel, clinically guided genetic screening approach for the identification of oncomirs, identifying mir-30d through this strategy. mir-30d regulates tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and migration. The chromosomal locus harboring mir-30d was amplified in more than 30% of multiple types of human solid tumors (n = 1,283). Importantly, higher levels of mir-30d expression were associated significantly with poor clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer patients (n=330, P=0.0016). Mechanistic investigations suggested that mir-30d regulates a large number of cancer-associated genes, including the apoptotic caspase CASP3.

Here, we report the surprising finding that exogenous plant miRNAs are present in the sera and tissues of various animals and that these exogenous plant miRNAs are primarily acquired orally, through food intake. MIR168a is abundant in rice and is one of the most highly enriched exogenous plant miRNAs in the sera of Chinese subjects. Functional studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that MIR168a could bind to the human/mouse low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 (LDLRAP1) mRNA, inhibit LDLRAP1 expression in liver, and consequently decrease LDL removal from mouse plasma. These findings demonstrate that exogenous plant miRNAs in food can regulate the expression of target genes in mammals. © 2012 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

Increasing evidence indicates that LIN28A functions as an oncogene promoting cancer cell growth. However, little is known about its molecular mechanism of cell cycle regulation in cancer. Using tissue microarrays, we found that strong LIN28A expression was reactivated in about 10% (7.1-17.1%) of epithelial tumors (six tumor types, n∇369). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that LIN28A promotes cell cycle progression in cancer cells. Genome-wide RNA-IP-chip experiments indicate that LIN28A binds to thousands of mRNAs, including a large group of cell cycle regulatory mRNAs in cancer and embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the ability of LIN28A to stimulate translation of LIN28A-bindingmRNAs,such asCDK2,was validated in vitro and in vivo. Finally, using a combined gene expression microarray and bioinformatics approach, we found that LIN28A also regulates CCND1 and CDC25A expression and that this is mediated by inhibiting the biogenesis of let-7 miRNA. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LIN28A is reactivated in about 10% of epithelialtumorsandpromotescell cycle progressionbyregulation of both mRNA translation (let-7-independent) and miRNA biogenesis (let-7-dependent). © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

The phosphorylation sites of the p53 regulation and the apoptosis key protein expressions of caspase3, 8 and 9 are detected by western blot assay. Our data show that, in case of short treatment time (48 h) at low cytokine concentrations (20 ng/ml), the co-immobilized drug demonstrates visible effects in comparison with the treatment using TNF-α plus IFN-γ freely attached on the polymeric plate (free drug). It is revealed that the co-immobilized drug leads to significant cell arrest in the S phase or G

84862295360	Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy	In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84863703004	The apoptosis of OVCAR-3 induced by TNF-α plus IFN-γ co-immobilized polylactic acid copolymers	The cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 cells, induced by three kinds of co-immobilized polylactic acid copolymer materials, compared with the corresponding control groups and free groups, are investigated in vitro. The three kinds of polylactic acid copolymers are PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)), PDLLA (poly(dl-lactic acid)), and PEG-PLGA (polyethylene glycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) copolymers). They are respectively photo-immobilized with TNF-α plus IFN-γ as the co-immobilized group, respectively mixed with TNF-α plus IFN-γ as the free group. First, the co-immobilized groups are prepared and examined by Fourier transform attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). Second, the cell morphology, cell mortality, and cell cycle arrest of OVCAR-3 cells induced by the co-immobilized group are analyzed by ematoxylin staining and flow cytometry. Third, western immunoblot analysis of the protein expression of p53, Bax, and Bcl-2 and immunofluorescence analysis of the protein location of caspase-3 in the induced OVCAR-3 cells were also performed. The results show that the co-immobilized group shows more visible inhibition activity towards OVCAR-3 cells than the control group and free group, after a time of 48 hours and at a concentration level of 20 ng ml

84864029638	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers exposure in breast milk in Shanghai, China: Levels, influencing factors and potential health risk for infants	The use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is increasing annually in China. Although several studies have reported significant contamination by these compounds in biological samples in China, little is known about the factors that may influence the levels of exposure and the potential health risk for infants. We investigated PBDE exposure levels in breast milk, its influencing factors and the potential health risk for infants in Shanghai, China by enrolling 48 healthy women between September 2006 and April 2007. PBDE exposure was assessed by analyses of seven PBDE congeners in breast milk. The estimated daily intake of PBDEs by infants via breastfeeding was determined for evaluating the potential health risk for infants. The median (range) of total PBDE content in breast milk was 8.81 (1.92-41.55). ng/g lipid. 34 (71%) of the 48 samples tested positive for all seven congeners. Maternal education level and household monthly salary were positively associated with PBDE concentration in breast milk (r = 0.337, p = 0.019 and r = 0.436, p = 0.004, respectively). The median of estimated daily intake of BDE-99 (6.67. ng/kg/day) by infants via breastfeeding was below the human no adverse effect level (NAEL) set for BDE-99 for neurodevelopmental toxicity (18.8. ng/kg/day). However, 3 (6%) of the samples exceeded the human NAEL. Taking the high detection rate of PBDEs in breast milk together with 6% of their EDI higher than NAEL in Shanghai, more studies on the effects of maternal PBDE exposure on fetal growth and child neurodevelopment are warranted. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84864150232	Impact of ERβ and CD44 expression on the prognosis of patients with stage II colon cancer	The correlation of ERβ/CD44 expression and progression of patients with stage II of colon cancer were explored in this work. A total of 220 paraffin-embedded specimens with stage II colon cancer from 1995 to 2003 were included for assessing ERβ and CD44 by immunohistochemistry in normal mucosa and tumor tissues. Kaplen-Meier method, log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to analyze the overall survival data. ROC curve was used to describe the capacity of variables in prognosis prediction. Jackknife method was used to perform cross validation of predictions. The survival rates were significantly different between the patients with high expression and low expression of CD44-tumor tissues (61 % vs. 90 %, p < 0.0001) and between the patients with high expression and low expression of ERβ-tumor tissue (99 % vs. 36 %, p < 0.0001), respectively. In addition, the interaction between expression of ERβ and CD44 was found that the impact of CD44 to the overall survive appeared only when expression of ERβ was low; and the high expression of ERβ-tumor could be regarded as a protective factor for overall survival. This study suggest that low expression of ERβ-tumor and high expression of CD44-tumor are risk factors for overall survival in patients with stage II colon cancer. © 2012 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

84865020558	A drug screening method based on the autophagy pathway and studies of the mechanism of evodiamine against influenza A virus	In this research, we have established a drug screening method based on the autophagy signal pathway using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation - fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BiFC-FRET) technique to develop novel anti-influenza A virus (IAV) drugs. We selected Evodia rutaecarpa Benth out of 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and explored the mechanisms of evodiamine, the major active component of Evodia rutaecarpa Benth, on anti-IAV activity. Our results showed that evodiamine could significantly inhibit IAV replication, as determined by a plaque inhibition assay, an IAV vRNA promoter luciferase reporter assay and the Sulforhodamine B method using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction. Additionally, evodiamine could significantly inhibit the accumulation of LC3-II and p62, and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. This compound also inhibited the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer, the expressions of Atg5, Atg7 and Atg12, and the cytokine release of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 after IAV infection. Evodiamine inhibited IAV-induced autophagy was also dependent on its action on the AMPK/TSC2/mTOR signal pathway. In conclusion, we have established a new drug screening method, and selected evodiamine as a promising anti-IAV compound. © 2012 Dai et al.

84865086928	The multi-targeted kinase inhibitor sunitinib induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells via PUMA	Constitutive activation of pro-survival kinases has become a promising target of small molecules with an increasing interest in developing multi-targeted agents. The mechanisms underlying the responsiveness to most agents targeting cancer specific survival pathways are still poorly understood but critical for their clinical application. In this study, we found that sunitinib, a small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including VEGFRs and PDGFRs induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in colon cancer cells in cell culture and xenograft models via the BH3-only protein PUMA. Sunitinib treatment induced PUMA transcription via the AKT/FoxO3a axis. PUMA, BH3 mimetics, or 5-Flurourical sensitized colon cancer cells to sunitinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PUMA was induced by sunitinib treatment in xenograft tumors, and deficiency in PUMA significantly suppressed the anti-tumor effects of sunitinib. Our study suggests that PUMA-mediated apoptosis is important for the therapeutic responses to sunitinib, and activation of the mitochondrial pathway by BH3 mimetics or PUMA manipulation may be useful for improving the antitumor activity of sunitinib. Modulation of PUMA and selective Bcl-2 family members might be potential biomarkers for predicting sunitinib responses. © 2012 Sun et al.

84866771296	Combination of TRAIL and Actinomycin D liposomes enhances antitumor effect in non-small cell lung cancer	The intractability of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to multimodality treatments plays a large part in its extremely poor prognosis. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising cytokine for selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells; however, many NSCLC cell lines are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The therapeutic effect can be restored by treatments combining TRAIL with chemotherapeutic agents. Actinomycin D (ActD) can sensitize NSCLC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulation of death receptor 4 (DR4) or 5 (DR5). However, the use of ActD has significant drawbacks due to the side effects that result from its nonspecific biodistribution in vivo. In addition, the short half-life of TRAIL in serum also limits the antitumor effect of treatments combining TRAIL and ActD. In this study, we designed a combination treatment of long-circulating TRAIL liposomes and ActD liposomes with the aim of resolving these problems. The combination of TRAIL liposomes and ActD liposomes had a synergistic cytotoxic effect against A-549 cells. The mechanism behind this combination treatment includes both increased expression of DR5 and caspase activation. Moreover, systemic administration of the combination of TRAIL liposomes and ActD liposomes suppressed both tumor formation and growth of established subcutaneous NSCLC xenografts in nude mice, inducing apoptosis without causing significant general toxicity. These results provide preclinical proof-of-principle for a novel therapeutic strategy in which TRAIL liposomes are safely combined with ActD liposomes. © 2012 Guo et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84866497960	Preoperative Cyfra21-1 and SCC-Ag serum titers predict survival in patients with stage II esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive significance of preoperative serum level of cytokeratin 19 fragments (Cyfra21-1) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) after complete resection in patients with stage II esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).Methods: Between 1995 and 2006, a total of 379 patients in stage II ESCC who underwent complete resection were consecutively recruited. Statistical analyses were applied to test the associations between preoperative serum titers of Cyfra21-1 and SCC-Ag, clinicopathological factors and prognoses.Results: Preoperative high and normal serum level of Cyfra21-1 and SCC-Ag were found in 47.8%, 52.2% and 72.8%, 27.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival rate for the entire cohort of patients was 95%, 78%, and 56%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 45.3 months longer in patients with low preoperative serum level of Cyfra21-1 (91.9 months) than those with high preoperative serum level of Cyfra21-1 (46.6 months) (P < 0.001). Median OS among patients with SCC-Ag-low level was also longer than those with SCC-Ag-high level (89.7 vs. 63.7 months, P < 0.001), especially for those with stage IIB (P < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, along with pTNM stage, preoperative serum level of Cyfra21-1 and SCC-Ag were independently and significantly predictive factors (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the five-year survival rate in double-low subset, either-low subset and double-high subset was 100%, 83% and 27%, respectively (P < 0.001).Conclusions: The preoperative serum level of Cyfra21-1 and SCC-Ag are independently significant predictors which negatively affected the survivals of patients with stage II ESCC. © 2012 Cao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84868087232	Changes in the Diurnal Rhythms during a 45-Day Head-Down Bed Rest	In spaceflight human circadian rhythms and sleep patterns are likely subject to change, which consequently disturbs human physiology, cognitive abilities and performance efficiency. However, the influence of microgravity on sleep and circadian clock as well as the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Placing volunteers in a prone position, whereby their heads rest at an angle of -6° below horizontal, mimics the microgravity environment in orbital flight. Such positioning is termed head-down bed rest (HDBR). In this work, we analysed the influence of a 45-day HDBR on physiological diurnal rhythms. We examined urinary electrolyte and hormone excretion, and the results show a dramatic elevation of cortisol levels during HDBR and recovery. Increased diuresis, melatonin and testosterone were observed at certain periods during HDBR. In addition, we investigated the changes in urination and defecation frequencies and found that the rhythmicity of urinary frequency during lights-off during and after HDBR was higher than control. The grouped defecation frequency data exhibits rhythmicity before and during HDBR but not after HDBR. Together, these data demonstrate that HDBR can alter a number of physiological processes associated with diurnal rhythms. © 2012 Liang et al.

84871573090	Combination of fingerprint analysis and multiple compounds determination for the quality control of Sanhuang tablet by HPLC-DAD	A simple and reliable high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD) was developed both for fingerprint analysis (FA) and simultaneous quantitative determination of ten bioactive constituents (scutellarin, baicalin, berberine hydrochloride, baicalein, aloe-emodin, wogonin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, and physcion) in Sanhuang Tablet (SH-T) by optimizing the extraction, separation and analytical conditions of HPLC-DAD. For FA, 38 peaks were selected as the characteristic peaks to evaluate the similarities of different samples collected from different manufacturers. The similarities of 14 SH-T samples from 12 manufacturers were beyond 0.80 indicating that samples were consistent to some extent, whereas the results from the quantitative data showed that the contents of some marker compounds were significantly different from manufacturer-to-manufacturer. These results indicate that this multiple components determination (MCD) method in combination with chromatographic fingerprint analysis is suitable for quality control of SH-T.

84872788994	ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 levels are elevated in thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections	Background: ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) is a recently identified family of extracellular metalloproteinases that has been shown to participate in tissue destruction. We hypothesized that ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 expression is increased in aortic tissues from patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. Methods: We examined ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 expression in human descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (n = 14), chronic descending thoracic aortic dissections (n = 16), and descending thoracic aortas from age-matched control organ donors (n = 12). In these tissues, we also evaluated the degradation of versican, a proteoglycan substrate of ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4. In cultured macrophages, we examined whether ADAMTS-4 functions in macrophage infiltration by using a transwell assay. Results: ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 protein and mRNA expression was significantly higher in thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection tissues than in control aortic tissues. Double immunofluorescence staining showed the expression of ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 in smooth muscle cells and macrophages. Consistent with the upregulation of ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 in thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection tissues, versican was degraded significantly more in these tissues than in control aortic tissues. In cultured macrophages, transforming growth factor-β increased ADAMTS-4 protein levels and induced macrophage invasion, and the knockdown of ADAMTS-4 reduced cell invasion. Conclusions: Increased expression of ADAMTS proteins may promote thoracic aortic aneurysm progression by degrading versican and facilitating macrophage invasion. © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

84873587301	An Efficient Procedure for Marker-Free Mutagenesis of S. coelicolor by Site-Specific Recombination for Secondary Metabolite Overproduction	Streptomyces bacteria are known for producing important natural compounds by secondary metabolism, especially antibiotics with novel biological activities. Functional studies of antibiotic-biosynthesizing gene clusters are generally through homologous genomic recombination by gene-targeting vectors. Here, we present a rapid and efficient method for construction of gene-targeting vectors. This approach is based on Streptomyces phage φBT1 integrase-mediated multisite in vitro site-specific recombination. Four 'entry clones' were assembled into a circular plasmid to generate the destination gene-targeting vector by a one-step reaction. The four 'entry clones' contained two clones of the upstream and downstream flanks of the target gene, a selectable marker and an E. coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector. After targeted modification of the genome, the selectable markers were removed by φC31 integrase-mediated in vivo site-specific recombination between pre-placed attB and attP sites. Using this method, part of the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) and actinorhodin (Act) biosynthetic gene clusters were deleted, and the rrdA encoding RrdA, a negative regulator of Red production, was also deleted. The final prodiginine production of the engineered strain was over five times that of the wild-type strain. This straightforward φBT1 and φC31 integrase-based strategy provides an alternative approach for rapid gene-targeting vector construction and marker removal in streptomycetes. © 2013 Zhang et al.

84873718626	Mir-30d Regulates multiple genes in the autophagy pathway and impairs autophagy process in human cancer cells	In human epithelial cancers, the microRNA (miRNA) mir-30d is amplified with high frequency and serves as a critical oncomir by regulating metastasis, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. Autophagy, a degradation pathway for long-lived protein and organelles, regulates the survival and death of many cell types. Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy plays an important function in epithelial tumor initiation and progression. Using a combined bioinformatics approach, gene set enrichment analysis, and miRNA target prediction, we found that mir-30d might regulate multiple genes in the autophagy pathway including BECN1, BNIP3L, ATG12, ATG5, and ATG2. Our further functional experiments demonstrated that the expression of these core proteins in the autophagy pathway was directly suppressed by mir-30d in cancer cells. Finally, we showed that mir-30d regulated the autophagy process by inhibiting autophagosome formation and LC3B-I conversion to LC3B-II. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the oncomir mir-30d impairs the autophagy process by targeting multiple genes in the autophagy pathway. This result will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of mir-30d in tumorigenesis and developing novel cancer therapy strategy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84873508731	Transcription of the Major Neurospora crassa microRNA-Like Small RNAs Relies on RNA Polymerase III	Most plant and animal microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. We previously discovered miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa and uncovered at least four different pathways for milRNA production. To understand the evolutionary origin of milRNAs, we determined the roles of polymerases II and III (Pol II and Pol III) in milRNA transcription. Our results show that Pol III is responsible for the transcription of the major milRNAs produced in this organism. The inhibition of Pol III activity by an inhibitor or by gene silencing abolishes the production of most abundant milRNAs and pri-milRNAs. In addition, Pol III associates with these milRNA producing loci. Even though silencing of Pol II does not affect the synthesis of the most abundant milRNAs, Pol II or both Pol II and Pol III are associated with some milRNA-producing loci, suggesting a regulatory interaction between the two polymerases for some milRNA transcription. Furthermore, we show that one of the Pol III-transcribed milRNAs is derived from a tRNA precursor, and its biogenesis requires RNase Z, which cleaves the tRNA moiety to generate pre-milRNA. Our study identifies the transcriptional machinery responsible for the synthesis of fungal milRNAs and sheds light on the evolutionary origin of eukaryotic small RNAs. © 2013 Yang et al.

84874538641	The heterochronic microRNA let-7 inhibits cell motility by regulating the genes in the actin cytoskeleton pathway in breast cancer	The heterochronic gene let-7 serves as a tumor suppressor microRNA by targeting various oncogenic pathways in cancer cells. Considerable evidence indicates that reduced expression of let-7 might be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with cancer. Here, we report that the expression levels of three let-7 family members, let-7a, let-7b, and let-7g, were significantly decreased in the patients with breast cancer with lymph node metastasis compared with those without lymph node metastasis. Enforced expression of let-7b significantly inhibits breast cancer cell motility and affects actin dynamics. Using bioinformatic and experimental approaches, four genes in the actin cytoskeleton pathway, including PAK1, DIAPH2, RDX, and ITGB8, were identified as let-7 direct targets. Blocking the expression of PAK1, DIAPH2, and RDX significantly inhibits breast cancer cell migration induced by let-7b repression. Our results indicate that reconstitution of let-7 expression in tumor cells could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastatic disease. ©2013 AACR.

84874745141	The expressions of MIF and CXCR4 protein in tumor microenvironment are adverse prognostic factors in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: Tumor-derived cytokines and their receptors usually take important roles in the disease progression and prognosis of cancer patients. In this survey, we aimed to detect the expression levels of MIF and CXCR4 in different cell populations of tumor microenvironments and their association with survivals of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).Methods: MIF and CXCR4 levels were measured by immunochemistry in tumor specimens from 136 resected ESCC. Correlation analyses and independent prognostic outcomes were determined using Pearson's chi-square test and Cox regression analysis.Results: The expression of CXCR4 in tumor cells was positively associated with tumor status (P = 0.045) and clinical stage (P = 0.044); whereas the expression of CXCR4 in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of MIF in tumor cells and in TILs were not associated with clinical parameters of ESCC patients. High MIF expression in tumor cells or in TILs or high CXCR4 expression in tumor cells was significantly related to poor survival of ESCC patients (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the expression of MIF or CXCR4 in tumor cells and the expression of MIF in TILs were adverse independent factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the whole cohort of patients (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the expression of MIF and CXCR4 in tumor cells were independent factors for reduced DFS and OS in metastatic/recurrent ESCC patients (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the expressions of MIF and CXCR4 in tumor cells and in TILs were significantly positively correlated (P < 0.05), and the combined MIF and CXCR4 expression in tumor cells was an independent adverse predictive factor for DFS and OS (P < 0.05).Conclusion: The expressions of MIF and CXCR4 proteins in tumor cells and TILs have different clinically predictive values in ESCC. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84877576157	Targeting bax interaction sites reveals that only homo-oligomerization sites are essential for its activation	Bax is a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that has a central role in the initiation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, the mechanism of Bax activation during apoptosis remains unsettled. It is believed that the activation of Bax is mediated by either dissociation from prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, or direct association with BH3-only members. Several interaction sites on Bax that mediate its interactions with other Bcl-2 family members, as well as its proapoptotic activity, have been identified in previous studies by other groups. To rigorously investigate the functional role of these interaction sites, we knocked in their respective mutants using HCT116 colon cancer cells, in which apoptosis induced by several stimuli is strictly Bax-dependent. Bax-mediated apoptosis was intact upon knock-in (KI) of K21E and D33A, which were shown to block the interaction of Bax with BH3-only activators. Apoptosis was partially reduced by KI of D68R, which impairs the interaction of Bax with prosurvival members, and S184V, a constitutively mitochondria-targeting mutant. In contrast, apoptosis was largely suppressed by KI of L70A/D71A, which blocks homo-oligomerization of Bax and its binding to prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins. Collectively, our results suggest that the activation of endogenous Bax in HCT116 cells is dependent on its homo-oligomerization sites, but not those previously shown to interact with BH3-only activators or prosurvival proteins only. We therefore postulate that critical interaction sites yet to be identified, or mechanisms other than protein-protein interactions, need to be pursued to delineate the mechanism of Bax activation during apoptosis. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84879153993	Three-dimensional CT features of occipital squama normal anatomy, anatomic variations and fractures	Objective: To evaluate 3D CT features of normal anatomy, anatomic variations and fractures of occipital squama. Methods: The 3D CT features on MIP, VR images were analyzed retrospectively in 589 pediatric cases. The normal anatomy, anatomic variations and fractures of occipital squama were observed respectively, and the differential diagnostic features including the individual location, appearance and extension were analyzed. Results: Four hundred and thirty-three patients (75.2%) showed normal anatomy, including 154 patients with adult occipital anatomical features, 279 patients with posterior intraoccipital synchondrosis, and 37 patients with Kerckring-supraoccipital synchondrosis. When cases with recent trauma history were excluded, 113 patients (19.1%) showed anatomic variants, including unpenetrating sutures and penetrating sutures. The former could be subdivided to Mendosal sutures in 23 cases, superior median fissures in 19 cases, and midline supraoccipital fissures in 4 cases, while the latter could be subdivided to the interparietal bone variations in 54 cases, wormian bones in 23 cases, and accessory bones in 7 cases. Two or more variations coexisted in 33 cases. The occipital squama fractures were shown in 34 cases (5.6%), including linear fractures in 27 cases, comminuted fractures in 3 cases, with depression fracture in one case, separation of cranial sutures in 3 cases, and other fractures associated with variants in 3 cases. The fractures were sharp, or jagged, without limitation of the occification. Conclusion: There are different 3D CT features of normal anatomy, anatomic variations and fractures of occipital squama in children, which are important for making the accurate diagnosis.

84899876083	Aurora kinase inhibition induces PUMA via NF-kB to kill colon cancer cells	Aurora kinases play a key role in mitosis and are frequently overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells. Inhibition of aurora kinases results in mitotic arrest and death of cancer cells, and has been explored as an anticancer strategy. However, how aurora inhibition kills cancer cells is poorly understood. In this study, we found that inhibition of aurora kinases by siRNA or small-molecule inhibitors led to induction of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein, in colorectal cancer cells irrespective of p53 status. Deficiency in PUMA increased polyploidy, improved cell survival, and abrogated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis induced by aurora kinase inhibitors. In response to aurora kinase inhibition, PUMA was directly activated by p65 through the canonical NF-kB pathway following AKT inhibition. Furthermore, PUMA was necessary for the chemosensitization and in vivo antitumor effects of aurora kinase inhibitors in colon cancer cells. These results suggest that PUMAinduction mediates the apoptotic response to mitotic arrest imposed by aurora kinase inhibition, and may be a useful indicator for the anticancer activity of aurora kinase inhibitors. © 2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

84905705835	Fibulin-3 suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling and lung cancer invasion	The 5 year survival rate of lung cancer is <20%, with most patients dying from distant metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer invasion and metastasis have not been fully characterized. In this study, we found that fibulin-3, a fibulin family extracellular matrix protein, functions as a suppressor of lung cancer invasion and metastasis. Fibulin-3 was downregulated in large fractions of lung tumors and cell lines, and inhibited lung cancer cell invasion and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), a promoter of lung cancer invasion. The expression levels of fibulin-3 and MMP-7 were inversely correlated in lung tumors. Fibulin-3 inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to activate glycogen synthase kinase 3β and suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which induces MMP-7 expression in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, fibulin-3 expression impeded the growth and metastasis of lung tumors in mice. Collectively, these results suggest that downregulation of fibulin-3 contributes to lung cancer invasion and metastasis by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and MMP-7 expression. © The Author 2014.

84908671045	A Functional Genomic Approach Identifies FAL1 as an Oncogenic Long Noncoding RNA that Associates with BMI1 and Represses p21 Expression in Cancer	In a genome-wide survey on somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in 2,394 tumor specimens from 12 cancer types, we found that about 21.8% of lncRNA genes were located in regions with focal SCNAs. By integrating bioinformatics analyses of lncRNA SCNAs and expression with functional screening assays, we identified an oncogene, focally amplified lncRNA on chromosome 1 (FAL1), whose copy number and expression are correlated with outcomes in ovarian cancer. FAL1 associates with the epigenetic repressor BMI1 and regulates its stability in order to modulate the transcription of a number of genes including CDKN1A. The oncogenic activity of FAL1 is partially attributable to its repression of p21. FAL1-specific siRNAs significantly inhibit tumor growth invivo.

However, how NSAIDs prevent colorectal tumorigenesis has remained obscure. We found that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and the BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (BID) are activated in adenomas from NSAID-treated patients. Loss of BID abolishes NSAID-mediated tumor suppression, survival benefit, and apoptosis in tumor-initiating stem cells in APCMin/+ mice. BID-mediated cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways is responsible for selective killing of neoplastic cells by NSAIDs. We further demonstrate that NSAIDs induce death receptor signaling in both cancer and normal cells, but only activate BID in cells with APC deficiency and ensuing c-Myc activation. Our results suggest that NSAIDs suppress intestinal tumorigenesis through BID-mediated synthetic lethality triggered by death receptor signaling and gatekeeper mutations, and provide a rationale for developing more effective cancer prevention strategies and agents.

11144317448	Preparation of monoclonal antibody against human tumor endothelial marker-7 extracellular fragment and study of the localization of its protein in carcinoma of different origins	Objective: To prepare monoclonal antibody specifically against human tumor endothelial marker-7(TEM7), then to examine the localization of TEM7 protein in solid tumors and related normal tissues of different origins by immunohistochemical staining in order to provide a valuable theoretical basis for TEM7-based vascular targeting cancer therapy. Methods: TEM7 extracellular cDNA fragment was cloned with PCR to pET-32b vector and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The purified TEM7 fusion protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice and monoclonal antibody against TEM7 extracellular fragment was prepared. The hybridoma cells were primarily screened by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), and identified by Western blot. With the previous prepared monoclonal antibody, tumor tissues and related normal tissues were examined immunohistochemically (ABC method) for the localization of TEM7 protein. Results: A specific monoclonal antibody against human TEM7 extracellular domain was characterized by Western blot and human TEM7 protein was detected in different tumor tissue. Conclusion: The TEM7 isn't only present in tumor endothelia, but also in cancer cells, even in some normal tissues. Our results suggested that to examine the protein markers may be a more effective and reliable way in the research of vascular targeting cancer therapies.
