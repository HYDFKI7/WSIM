84926368129	Application of mycophenolate mofetil combined with low-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid regimen after renal transplantation	BACKGROUND: Sufficient dose of mycophenolate mofetil combined with low-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid regimen may be an ideal treatment option for renal transplant recipients, and the regimen has been widely used in clinic due to its low nephrotoxicity, few adverse reactions and strong immunosuppressive effects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil combined with low-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid regimen in renal transplantation patients with the control of mycophenolate mofetil combined with standard-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid. METHODS: A total of 210 patients receiving a single-organ renal allograft were randomly divided into standard-dose tacrolimus group (n=104) and low-dose tacrolimus group (n=106). Individual patients were treated for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoints were the chronic allograft damage index and glomerular filtration rate at 12 months after transplantation. The secondary efficacy end points mainly included the acute rejection rate, treatment failure rate, and the survival rate of patient and transplant kidney. The safety parameters such as new onset of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also evaluated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The vast majorities of patients were administrated with sufficient dose of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g/d or above) in two groups. The majority of the patients in standard-dose tacrolimus group had the mean trough level below the protocol-defined, which led to the similar mean trough level between standard-dose and low-dose tacrolimus group. These could also confirm that the regimen of mycophenolate mofetil combined with low-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid had been wildly accepted and used by clinicians. The efficacy and safety of two groups were similar. The mean chronic allograft damage index of the renal pathological changes at 12 months after transplantation in standard-dose and low-dose tacrolimus group were 1.82 and 2.13 respectively (P=0.081 3), the mean glomerular filtration rates were 77.08 mL/min and 80.12 mL/min (P=0.794 9), acute rejection rates were 2.6% and 5.2% (P=0.681 2), and the survival rates of patients and transplant kidney were 100% and 99.1% (P=1.000 0). The rates of new onset of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus in the standard-dose and low-dose tacrolimus group were 2.9% and 1.9%, and the rates of hyperlipidemia were 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively. For the regimen of mycophenolate mofetil combined with tacrolimus and corticosteroid, the utilization of sufficient dose of mycophenolate mofetil could reduce the dose of tacrolimus, thereby significantly reducing the nephrotoxicity, hyperlipidemia and new onset of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus caused by tacrolimus and achieving a good balance of efficacy and toxicity when maintaining a strong immune inhibition and reducing the acute rejection incidence successfully.

0030992345	Changes in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, IV and IV in renal cell carcinoma	The activities of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT) III, IV and V were determined in 10 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and compared with the normal kidney cortex (NKC) regions of the same kidney resected from RCC patients. It was found that the GnT LII and GnT IV activities decreased consistently in all samples of RCC, while GnT V activity increased, decreased or did not change in different samples. The mean levels of GnT III and GnT IV activities in RCC were found to be very significantly lower than those of NKC on statistical analysis, but the mean value of GnT V activity was almost identical in RCC and NKC. The decrease in GnT activities in RCC were compatible with the decrease in bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and antennary number of complex-type N-glycans in γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-GT) partially purified from RCCs as studied with concanavalin A (ConA) affinity column chromatography, which showed a decrease of unbound fraction and increase of bound fractions.

3242730302	Differential changes of nitric oxide synthesis in renal ischemia reperfusion injury	Purpose: Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) plays important roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes in the kidney. In this study, we investigated the expression of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) during ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rat kidneys. Methods: IRI was induced by clamping the left renal artery for 1 hour followed by 1 h reperfusion. NOS activities of kidneys was assayed at various time points, NOS protein levels as well as NOS mRNA expression were determined by Western blot and RT-PCR methods respectively. Results: eNOS activity, protein level and mRNA expression were all increased in early stage of IRI (2-6 h after reperfusion), and decreased after 3 days of IRI, and then gradually returned to basal level after 21 days. During this period, there was a significantly elevation of iNOS expression, and reached its peak level at 3 days after IRI, and then decreased to basal level. Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrate that differential expression of eNOS and iNOS in kidney during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, selective regulation of eNOS and iNOS expression may be therapeutically relevant in treating patients with renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.

3142735836	Surgical operation of primary aldosteronism	Purpose: To study the surgical indications and factors associated with normolization of blood pressure (BP) after surgery of primary aldosteronism(PA). Methods: Clinical features of 83 cases of different types of PA were analysed. Sixty nine cases accepted adrenalectomy or partial adrenalectomy. Surgical indications, patterns, and pathological features associated with results were evaluated. Results: Fifty nine surgical cases were followed. Fifty five cases (93.2%) had normal serum potassium level; BP was normalized in 33 cases (55.9%; Hypertension persisted but BP control was significantly improved in 20 cases (33.9), and not improved in the remaining 6 patients (10.2%). The rate without suppressed PRA was 12.1% (4/33) in normal BP group, and 38.5% (10/26) in remained hypertension group (P < 0.05). The durations of hypertension of latter was longer than that of former (4.1 years vs 7.5 years, P < 0.05). In ablosteronism producing adenomas patients, 14 cases were treated by partial adrenalectomy, and 28 cases adrenalectomy. Hypertension was cured or improved in 13 cases (92.9%) in former and 27 cases (96.4%) in latter, there were no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with unilateral overproduction of aldosterone who potentially can be cured surgically. Patients presented with a single adrenal adenomas can be treated by partial adrenalectomy, those with multiple adenomas or hyperplasia should accepted adrenalectomy. The factors related with surgical effect included durations of hypertension, secondary hypertensive kidney damage, and insufficient surgery or recurrence.

33750596762	Blocking tumor necrosis factor-α inhibits folic acid-induced acute renal failure	Systemic administration of mice with folic acid (FA) has been used for studying the pathogenesis of acute renal failure. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FA induces acute renal failure remain poorly understood. We found that CD-1 mice treated with FA developed acute renal failure characterized by increased blood urea nitrogen, necrosis, and apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells. Compared to control mice, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was markedly elevated in blood and kidneys of these FA-treated mice, accompanied by markedly reduced expression of anti-apoptotic protein BclxL in their kidneys. In vivo administration of FA-treated CD-1 mice with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody restored the expression of BclxL in kidneys and inhibited the necrosis and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells, leading to the amelioration of acute renal failure. In ex vivo cultures, we found that FA enhanced production of TNF-α, decreased expression of BclxL protein, and induced apoptosis of mouse cortical tubule (MCT) cells. Addition of neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody, but not control IgG, in the cultures markedly blocked the apoptotic death of FA-treated MCT cells and restored expression of BclxL to the same levels as those MCT cells cultured in the absence of FA. All these results suggest that TNF-α is a critical inflammatory cytokine responsible for FA-mediated acute renal failure. Furthermore, in vivo administration of anti-TNF-α antibody may be proved as an effective approach for acute renal failure prevention and treatment. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33847150634	DRB Genotyping in Cynomolgus Monkeys from China Using Polymerase Chain Reaction -Sequence-Specific Primers	Cynomolgus macaques are relevant models for human diseases and transplantation. In each case, a complete understanding of these models requires knowledge of the macaque major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Because of high polymorphism and multiple genes per haplotype, it has been difficult to develop a rapid typing method for cynomolgus monkey MHC class II. We developed a simple and rapid polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) strategy for Chinese cynomolgus monkey DRB locus typing. Forty Chinese cynomolgus monkeys originating from the Guangxi Province in China were included in the study. Twenty nine cynomolgus monkey allele-specific primer pairs were designed based on published Macaca fascicularis (Mafa)-DRB locus gene sequences. Allele-specific PCR products ranged in size from 143 to 253 bp; 5′ and 3′ Mafa-DRB locus allele specific primers were located in the second exon. Specific PCR product gel purification was followed by direct sequencing in both directions. Our data showed prominent variability in the number of Mafa-DRB sequences ranging from 2 to 7 per animal. This analysis demonstrated that most of the amplicons were identical to Mafa-DRB sequences that our PCR primers were to amplify. However, 98 to 99% similarity was noticed in the case of Mafa-DRB4*0101, Mafa-DRB*W2101, and Mafa-DRB*W4901 sequences. The observed mismatches were located in nonpolymorphic regions. Thus, haplotype analysis confirmed the existence of allelic associations published earlier. In addition, we propose a new DRB sequence. The established medium-resolution PCR-SSP technique appears to be a highly reproducible and discriminatory typing method for detecting polymorphisms of DRB genes in Chinese cynomolgus monkeys. © 2007 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

34748813055	Blockade of LIGHT/HVEM and B7/CD28 signaling facilitates long-term islet graft survival with development of allospecific tolerance	BACKGROUND. Previous studies have shown that blockade of LIGHT, a T-cell costimulatory molecule belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, by soluble lymphotoxin β receptor-Ig (LTβR-Ig) inhibited the development of graft-versus-host disease. The cardiac allografts were significantly prolonged in LIGHT deficient mice. No data are yet available regarding the role of the LIGHT/HVEM pathway in more stringent fully allogeneic models such as skin and islet transplantation models. METHODS. Streptozotocin-induced chemical diabetic BALB/C mice underwent transplantation with allogeneic C57BL/6 islets and were treated with LTβR-Ig, CTLA4-Ig or a combination of both in the early peritransplant period. RESULTS. Administration of CTLA4-Ig or LTβ R-Ig alone only increased graft survival to 55 days and 27 days respectively, whereas simultaneous blockade of both pathways significantly prolonged the islet allograft survival for more than 100 days. Long-term survivors were retransplanted with donor-specific (C57BL/6) islets and the grafted islets remained functional for more than 100 days. All of islet allografts were protected against rejection when the mixtures of 1×10 CD4 T cells from tolerant mice and islet allografts were cotransplanted under the renal capsule of the naïve BALB/c recipients. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that: 1) a synergistic effect for prolonged graft survival can be obtained by simultaneously blocking LIGHT and CD28 signaling in the stringent model of islet allotransplantation; 2) development of donor-specific immunological tolerance is associated with the presence of regulatory T-cell activity; and 3) local cotransplantation of the allografts with the regulatory T cells can effectively prevent allograft rejection and induce donor-specific tolerance in lymphocytes-sufficient recipients. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

37549047612	A novel set of DNA methylation markers in urine sediments for sensitive/specific detection of bladder cancer	Purpose: This study aims to provide a better set of DNA methylation markers in urine sediments for sensitive and specific detection of bladder cancer. Experimental Design: Fifty-nine tumor-associated genes were profiled in three bladder cancer cell lines, a small cohort of cancer biopsies and urine sediments by methylation-specific PCR. Twenty-one candidate genes were then profiled in urine sediments from 132 bladder cancer patients (8 cases for stage 0a; 68 cases for stage I; 50 cases for stage II; 4 cases for stages III; and 2 cases for stage IV), 23 age-matched patients with noncancerous urinary lesions, 6 neurologic diseases, and 7 healthy volunteers. Results: Despite six incidences of four genes reported in 3 of 23 noncancerous urinary lesion patients analyzed, cancer-specific hypermethylation in urine sediments were reported for 15 genes (P < 0.05). Methylation assessment of an 11-gene set (SALL3, CFTR, ABCC6, HPR1, RASSF1A, MT1A, RUNX3, ITGA4, BCL2, ALX4, MYOD1, DRM, CDH13, BMP3B, CCNA1, RPRM, MINT1, and BRCA1) confirmed the existing diagnosis of 121 among 132 bladder cancer cases (sensitivity, 91.7%) with 87% accuracy. Significantly, more than 75% of stage 0a and 88% of stage I disease were detected, indicating its value in the early diagnosis of bladder cancer. Interestingly, the cluster of reported methylation markers used in the U.S. bladder cancers is distinctly different from that identified in this study, suggesting a possible epigenetic disparity between the American and Chinese cases. Conclusions: Methylation profiling of an 11-gene set in urine sediments provides a sensitive and specific detection of bladder cancer. © 2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

84876678814	Osteopontin level correlates with acute cellular renal allograft rejection	Background: Osteopontin (OPN) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that is upregulated in cell-mediated immunity and various inflammatory states of the kidney. However, the relationship between OPN levels plasma/urine and acute renal allograft rejection is still unknown. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between OPN levels in plasma/urine and acute cellular rejection post-renal transplantation. Materials and methods: Clinical data and biologic samples of renal transplant recipients were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with biopsy-proved acute cellular rejection (ACR) (n = 22), protocol biopsy-proved non-rejection (non-R) (n = 16), and living related donors as healthy control (HC) (n = 10) were involved in this study. OPN level in plasma and urine was detected using the human OPN enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Type and grade of ACR were diagnosed based on Banff' 03 classification criteria of renal allograft pathology. No prisoners or organs from prisoners were used in this study. Results: Compared with non-R patients and HC, plasma and urine OPN levels in ACR patients were significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference between non-R patients and HC (P > 0.05). In ACR patients, plasma OPN level was positively correlated with Banff grading of acute rejection, and a cut-off value of 24.20 ng/mL was further demonstrated a good clinical value in receiver operation characteristic curve. Conclusions: The data obtained suggested that assessment of OPN levels in plasma and urine, especially in plasma, should be useful in predicting and evaluating the severity of ACR in renal transplant recipients.

84907986089	A novel proteolysis-resistant cyclic helix B peptide ameliorates kidney ischemia reperfusion injury	Helix B surface peptide (HBSP), derived from erythropoietin, displays powerful tissue protection during kidney ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury without erythropoietic side effects. We employed cyclization strategy for the first time, and synthesized thioether-cyclized helix B peptide (CHBP) to improve metabolic stability and renoprotective effect. LC-MS/MS analysis was adopted to examine the stability of CHBP in vitro and in vivo. The renoprotective effect of CHBP in terms of renal function, apoptosis, inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition, and histological injury was also detected in vivo and in vitro. Antibody array and western blot were performed to analyze the signal pathway of involvement by CHBP in the IR model and renal tubular epithelial cells. In this study, thioether-cyclized peptide was significantly stable in vivo and in vitro. One dose of 8. nmol/kg CHBP administered intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion improved renal protection compared with three doses of 8. nmol/kg linear HBSP in a 48. h murine IR model. In a one-week model, the one dose CHBP-treated group exhibited remarkably improved renal function over the IR group, and attenuated kidney injury, including reduced inflammation and apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that the phosphorylation of autophagy protein mTORC1 was dramatically reduced upon CHBP treatment. We also demonstrated that CHBP induced autophagy via inhibition of mTORC1 and activation of mTORC2, leading to renoprotective effects on IR. Our results indicate that the novel metabolically stable CHBP is a promising therapeutic medicine for kidney IR injury treatment.

84926188200	Serum-stabilized Naked Caspase-3 siRNA Protects Autotransplant Kidneys in a Porcine Model	The naked small interfering RNA (siRNA) of caspase-3, a key player in ischemia reperfusion injury, was effective in cold preserved and hemoreperfused kidneys, but not autotransplanted kidneys in our porcine models. Here, chemically modified serum stabilized caspase-3 siRNAs were further evaluated. The left kidney was retrieved and infused by University of Wisconsin solution with/without 0.3 mg caspase-3 or negative siRNA into the renal artery for 24-hour cold storage (CS). After an intravenous injection of 0.9 mg siRNA and right-uninephrectomy, the left kidney was autotransplanted for 2 weeks. The effectiveness of caspase-3 siRNA was confirmed by caspase-3 knockdown in the post-CS and/or post-transplant kidneys with reduced apoptosis and inflammation, while the functional caspase-3 siRNA in vivo was proved by detected caspase-3 mRNA degradation intermediates. HMGB1 protein was also decreased in the post-transplanted kidneys; correlated positively with renal IL-1β mRNA, but negatively with serum IL-10 or IL-4. The minimal off-target effects of caspase-3 siRNA were seen with favorable systemic responses. More importantly, renal function, associated with active caspase-3, HMGB1, apoptosis, inflammation, and tubulointerstitial damage, was improved by caspase-3 siRNA. Taken together, the 2-week autotransplanted kidneys were protected when caspase-3 siRNA administrated locally and systemically, which provides important evidence for future clinical trials.

42949137531	The value of multi-slice spiral CT in the preoperative assessment of living renal donor	Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the value of multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) in the preoperative evaluation of living renal donor as a all in one modality. Methods: Thirty-six potential living renal donors underwent the examination using a GE light VCT scanner. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The plain scan, early arterial phase, late arterial phase and excretory phase scans are performed in the former 25 donors (injection rate 5 ml/s, total volume 100 ml, tube tension 120 kV). While in the later 11 donors (2 ml/s 40 ml +4 ml/s 60 ml), the scanning protocol included the plain scan (100 kV), vascular phase and excretory phase scans (100 kV). The excretory phase data were used in the reconstruction of CT urography in both groups. All images were reviewed by one radiologist and one urologist, and the findings of MSCT were compared with intraoperative findings for 33 donors, to investigate the utilities of MSCT in assessing renal vascularity, urinary tract and lesions of renal parenchyma. When discrepancies are found between the two reviewers, consensus was obtained via discussion. Au data was statiscally processed with SPSS for Windows. Results: MSCT angiography is in accordance with intraoperative findings in demonstrating the anatomy of renal arteries and renal vein trunk, accesary arteries, early branching of renal artery. The findings from CTA are highly in accordance with the intraoperative findings, which facilitate intraoperative ligation and reduce relevant complications. CTU demonstrates the anatomy of urinary tract in good agreement with the intraoperative findings. The image quality of 3D vascularity and CTU between the two groups, scored 4.4 ± 1.2 vs 4.2 ± 1.3 and 4.6 ± 0.8 vs 4.4 ± 0.9 respectively, no statistical between-groups difference was found (Z = - 0.89, -0.47, P >0.05). Conclusion: MSCT multiphase scanning combined with CTA and CTU play a important role in the evaluation of living renal donor, which preoperatively provide detailed information of renal vascularity, urinary tract and renal parenchyma as a all-in-one modality.

53049094382	Prediction of acute cellular renal allograft rejection by urinary metabolomics using MALDI-FTMS	The present study investigated small molecule analysis of urinary samples as a noninvasive method to detect acute cellular renal allograft rejection. Matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTMS) was used to analyze 15 urinary samples from transplant patients with different grades of biopsy showing improved clinical acute cellular rejection (ACR) and 24 urinary samples from 8 transplant patients without evidence of rejection. Seven small molecules demonstrated highly successful diagnostic performance (mlz): 278.1 (t = 3.398, p = 0.004), 293.0 (t = 2.169, p = 0.048), 294.1 (t = 2.154, p = 0.05), 382.2 (t = 2.961, p= 0.010), 383.3 (t = 2.270, p = 0.040), 402.2 (t = 2.994, p = 0.010), 424.0 (t = 2.644, p = 0.019). Kidney transplant patients with ACR could be distinguished from those without ACR using four individual small molecules with a specificity of 100%. In conclusion, the combination of MALDI-FTMS technology with a clear definition of patient groups can detect urine small molecule associated with ACR. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

57549101696	Hand-Assisted Laparoscopic Donor Nephrectomy: A Comparative Study With Conventional Open Donor Nephrectomy in a Single Chinese Center	Background: Traditional open donor nephrectomy (ODN) is associated with good outcomes and excellent allograft function; nevertheless, it causes too much injury to the donor. Hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HLDN) may accomplish these goals with less damage. We compared the outcomes of the hand-assisted with the traditional open approach. We also investigated whether the availability of the HLDN approach affected a donor's decision and why he or she selected HLDN versus ODN. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed donor and allograft outcomes for the first 65 patients undergoing HLDN at our institution compared with those of 32 patients undergoing traditional ODN. Patient data were obtained from medical record reviews and telephone interviews. Results: HLDN and ODN were successfully completed in 97 (100%) donors. No conversion to open operation occurred among the HLDN group. The mean (standard deviation) operative durations were 157.92 (23.79) minutes for HLDN and 103.21 (19.63) minutes for ODN (P = .000), and hospital stays were 5.00 (1.54) days for the HLDN group and 6.59 (0.79) days for the ODN group (P = .000). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in postoperative donor (P = .541) and recipient (P = .337) renal functions. The primary reason encouraging donors was family obligations and bonds (70.1%); the availability of HLDN did encourage the decision (29.9%). Although all renal donors were aware of the option of HLDN, 28 selected ODN because of financial reasons, another 4 patients due to safety concerns. The main reasons for choosing HLDN instead of ODN were less postoperative pain (60%) and cosmetic concerns (29.2%). Conclusions: HLDN was safe and feasible to procure a normally functional organ for live donor transplantation. The availability of the HLDN approach did affect a donor's decision. The main reason for choosing HLDN instead of ODN was less postoperative pain. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

57149089467	Elder living related donor kidney transplantation: Clinical analysis of 14 cases	Objective To analyze the difference in clinical outcome between elder living related donor kidney transplantation (ELRDKT) and standard living related donor kidney transplantation (SLRDKT). Methods The clinical data of 14 ELRDKTs and 84 SLRDKTs were analyzed retrospectively, both donors and recipients were followed up. The comparison between ELRDKT and SLRDKT was made on renal function of donors/recipients, the rate of delayed, graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR), and the survival rate of renal graft. Results There was no significant difference in the change of serum creatinine (Scr) between elder donors and standard donors (P> 0. 05). There was no significant difference between ELRDKT and SLRDKT in the recovery time [(4. 2 ± 2. 1) vs (3. 3 ± 1. 6) days, P>0. 05] while the Scr returned to normal. In groups of ELRDKT and SLRDKT, the rate of AR was respectively 14. 3% and 9. 8%, the rate of DGF was respectively 21. 4% and 11. 0%, the survival rate of renal graft was respectively 92. 9% and 98. 8%. Conclusions With stringent screening and overall assessment of elder donors, ELRDKT is safe and effective for patient with end-stage renal disease procedure.

58449120710	The prognostic value of peritumoral regulatory T cells and its correlation with intratumoral cyclooxygenase-2 expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic value of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and its correlation with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD4+, Foxp3+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumour COX-2 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing RCC from 125 patients. Prognostic effects of low and high expression were evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis using the median values as thresholds. The expression of Tregs and COX-2 were compared with the clinicopathological variables. In addition, Tregs and its correlation with COX-2 expression was also analysed. RESULTS: Peritumoral Tregs were positively correlated with intratumoral COX-2 expression (Spearman rank correlation 0.336, P < 0.001). Peritumoral Tregs were associated with TNM stage (P = 0.001) and tumour size (P = 0.002), while intratumoral COX-2 expression was associated with TNM stage (P = 0.018) and grade (P = 0.013). Using multivariate analysis, increased peritumoral Tregs, higher TNM stage (III + IV), larger tumour size (≥7 cm) and higher nuclear grade (III + IV) were independent predictors for significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Increased peritumoral Tregs are associated with worse prognosis in clear cell RCC. The high intratumoral COX-2 expression may be the underlying reason for the aberrant gathering of Tregs. These results suggest that clinical application of COX-2 inhibitors may benefit those patients with higher intratumoral COX-2 immunostaining by reducing the transformation of Tregs in RCC. © 2008 The Authors.

68949092538	Clinical analysis on the relationship between the donor resource and the result of living related donor kidney transplantation	Objective To analyze the impact of allograft category on the result of living related donor kidney transplantation (LRKT)and to evaluate the predominant donors. Methods A retrospective analysis of 104 recipients receiving LRKT from Apr. 2004 to Mar. 2008 was performed. Based on donor resource, all the recipient-donor pairs were divided into four groups: spousal donation group, parental donation group, sibling donation group and cousinly donation group. The observational parameters were selected for analysis, such as average post-transplant hospitalization dates, time for serum creatinine (Scr) back to normal level, Scr levels of every observational time point, incidence of major complications (infection, rejection, DGF) and recipient/graft survival rate. Results Recipient/graft survival rate of sibling donation group seemed higher. Recipients of sibling donation group seemed to have fewer post-transplant hospitalization dates, but higher rates of infection, while those of parental donation group seemed to have higher rates of rejection. Rates of rejection and infection of spousal donation group were lower than supposed. There was no statistically significant difference in time for Scr back to normal level and Scr levels of every observational time point among these four groups. Conclusions The result of sibling donor renal transplantation is better, while short-term outcome of spouse donor renal transplantation is ideal, which is similar with parent or cousin donor renal transplantation. Except for human leukocyte antigen, aspects such as quality of donor kidney, predominance during operation and self-administration post-transplant are also the guarantee for the success.

70349826710	Diagnosis and risk factors analysis of BK virus infection in renal transplant recipients	Objective To investigate diagnosis methods and risk factors of BK virus infection in renal transplant recipients. Methods Ninety-two patients received renal transplantation in our center were undertaken BK virus detection including presence of decoy cells in urinary sediment, urine and serum BKV-DNA. Epidemiological features and risk factors of BK virus infection were analyzed. Results Among 92 patients, decoy cells were found in 29 patients (31. 5%). The median time for the first detection of decoy cells was 18. 3 months after surgery. The sensitivity and specificity of decoy cells to diagnose BK virus infection were 67. 7% and 86. 9% respectively. Twenty-two patients (23. 9%) were diagnosed as BK viruria at a median time of 16. 3 months after surgery, and 9 recipients (9. 8%) at a median time of 39. 5 months after surgery. Decoy cells were associated with a significantly higher rate of graft dysfunction. Eight of 9 renal recipients diagnosed as BK viremia were demonstrated as graft dysfunction. Risk factors of BK virus infection were analyzed by Logistic regression, which implied that immune induction and patients without hemodialysis were high risk factors. Whereas, immunosuppressive regimen, primary kidney disease and post-surgery infections were found no significant difference. Conclusions BK virus infection is a common complication of renal transplantation. The infection of BK virus may result in graft dysfunction. Detection of decoy cells and BKV-DNA in urine samples may lead to early diagnosis of BK virus infection.

77953386053	Detection of bladder cancer by accessing DNA methylation state in urine sediments	Objectives: To assess DNA methylation state of the 13 genes in urine sediments and evaluate their value in diagnosis of bladder cancer. Methods: Ninety-two patients with bladder cancer, 23 patients with non tumorous urinary disease, 6 patients with neurological disease, and 7 healthy volunteers were recruited in the study. The DNA methylation state of tumor-related promoters in urine sediments was determined by Methylation specific PCR method (MSP). Results: The frequency of hypermethylation of 13 genes in 92 cases with bladder cancer was higher than that in 23 cases of bladder diseases, while all the genes were at demethylation state in the 7 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with neurological disease. The incidence of hypermethylation was significantly higher in bladder cancer compared with non tumorous urinary disease (P < 0.05). If DNA hypermethylation was used as a positive indicator, 88.0% (81/92cases) of bladder cancer could be detected. Conclusion: Assessing DNA methylation state in the promoter of tumor-related genes in urine sediments by MSP method is effective for detection of bladder cancer.

77953449312	Methylation profiling in urine sediments and detection of bladder cancer	Objective: To identify and evaluate the informative set of genes for DNA methylation-based detection of bladder cancer in urine sediments. Methods: Methylation specific PCR was used in the test. Results: Ninety of 20 genes tested in three bladder cancer cell lines (T24, 5637 and SCaBER) had at least one allele methylated. Six genes were MSP profiled in urine sediments from 40 cases of bladder cancer and the following controls: the healthy volunteers (7 cases), non-cancerous urinary diseases (23 cases) and the neurological diseases (6 cases). While no methylated were observed in the control groups, the methylated incidence in bladder cancer group was: SALL3 is 67.5% (27/40), MT1A is 50.0% (20/40), HPP1 is 50.0% (20/40), MYOD1 is 37.5% (15/40), BRCA1 is 32.5% (13/40), and TMS1 is 5.0% (2/40), respectively. By using any gene being hypermethylated of the 5 most frequently methylated genes tested as the positive indicator, over 90% (36/40 cases) bladder cancer cases in this retrospective study were detectable. Conclusion: MSP profiling of these 5 genes in urine sediments is a potentially robust method for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer.

77953160250	Clinical analysis on living related renal transplantation from donors above 60 years old	Objective To introduce one-center experience on kidney transplantation from donors more than 60 years old. Methods From 2004 to 2008, there were 15 recipients received allograft from donors older than 60 years in the center of Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University. Seven cases were mother-to-child, seven were father-to-child, and 1 case was renal transplantation between spouses. This retrospective study examined data on renal transplant donors and recipients. Demographic information about the study population was summarized using simple means for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Results Nine donors underwent handassisted laparoscopic nephrectomy, the others underwent minimal-incision open nephrectomy, in which 2 cases donated right kidneys and 13 cases donated left kidneys. Serum creatinine of 12 recepients returned to normal level, the mean time was 3. 5 days. All donor and recepients were followed up for one year to four years. Renal function of three donors was abnormal. One recepient died due to allograft thrombopoiesis. Nine recepients took biopsy of the allograft, while 6 had rejection of different degrees. Two cases had drug-induced nephrotoxicity. One case was normal. Seven cases with elevation of serum creatinine (46.7%) were all male recepients. Conclusions The incidence of acute rejection was much higher in transplantation from older donors, and older donors could not match nephron dose to most of the male recipients' metabolic demand.

77957784782	Protective effect of recombinant human erythropoietin on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats	Objective: To investigate protective effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) at different dosages and administration times on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rats. Methods: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: Sham, IR, EPO-1 (injection via inferior vena cava 30 min before releasing the clamp at the dosages of 1 000, 2 000 and 3 000 U/kg) and EPO-2 (injection through left renal vein 30 min before releasing the clamp at the dosages of 1 000, 2 000 and 3 000 U/kg). IRI model was made by right nephrectomy 45 min after left renal ischemia with non-traumatic vascular clamps. We detected serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), MDA, SOD, IL-6 and Caspase-3 levels. Apoptosis of tubular epithelium was observed by TUNEL assay. Results: Scr, BUN, MDA, Caspase-3 and IL-6 levels in EPO groups were significantly lower than those in IR group (P<0. 05). Compared to IR group, EPO groups had higher SOD levels (P<0. 05). It showed that histological damage and TUNEL-positive cells were less in EPO groups than those in IR group (P<0. 05). We found that administration before reperfusion at the dosage of 3 000 U/kg had better effect than administration in the moment of reperfusion (P<0. 05). Conclusions: rhEPO can attenuate renal IRI. The protective effect might be mediated by its inhibition of immflamitation, oxidation and tubular epithelium apoptosis. This effct has dependence on the dosage, and administration before reperfusion has better effect than administration in the moment of reperfusion.

78651496831	Clinical analysis of pulmonary infections in 25 patients after kidney transplantation	Purpose To analyze the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infections (PI) in kidney transplant patients. Methods One hundred and eight patients underwent the allograft renal transplantation in 2006 at Zhongshan Hospital were follow-up visited, the clinical data of 25 PI patients hospitalized were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Results Of these 108 patients, 25 (23.15%) patients developed pulmonary infection. The median time and mean time of infection is respectively 83. 5 days and 87. 64 days after the transplantation. The infection rates within 3 months and 3 to 6 months was respectively 64. 29 % and 35. 71 %. Four (3. 70%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 3 (8. 57%) of them died. Among 3 patients who suffered twice pulmonary infections, PI occurred within 3 months in 2 patients. The types of pulmonary infection included bacteria (4 cases) , cytomegalovirus (2 cases) , aspergillus (1 case) , mycoplasma (1 case) and undetermined pathogen infection (17 cases). Conclusions Pulmonary infection mainly occurs within half a year and especially 3 months after transplantation, pathogens are various features and are hard to be diagnosed in the earlier period. The key of successful treatment should involve combination of anti- bacteria, anti-virus, anti- fungi and anti-mycoplasma drugs at the early stage, decrement of the immunodepressant, timely application of non-insulted nasal catheter / face mask and mechanical ventilation to correct hypoxia.

79951518983	Analysis of transcriptional factors and regulation networks in patients with acute renal allograft rejection	Acute rejection (AR) remains a major clinical challenge, leading to the development of chronic renal allograft failure. The aim of the present study was to explore potential transcriptional factors and regulation networks in the disease to predict the occurrence and process of AR and understand potential strategies to prevent from the disease. Three-hundred fifty-two patients with renal failure had kidney transplantation during March 2006 and March 2010, of which 85 suffered from AR. Plasma from 13 patients with kidney transplantation was collected, of which 5 were from patients with AR and 8 from those without AR. Among the 179 proteins identified by using iTRAQ labeling and quantitative proteomic technology, 66 proteins were at least 2-fold different between patients with or without AR. The results demonstrated that the dominant processes and responses were associated with inflammation and complement activation in AR. A number of transcription factors were identified in AR patients, including nuclear factor-?B, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. The analysis of transcription regulation networks suggested that the cross-talks among these key transcription factors might contribute to the acute response and coagulation pathway. Thus, our study provides a new description and insight into the molecular events in AR and potential strategies for identifying diagnostic biomarkers. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

0036378606	Enhanced MCP-1 expression during ischemia/reperfusion injury is mediated by oxidative stress and NF-κB	Background. Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury is a major cause of acute renal failure in both native kidneys and renal allografts. One important feature of such injury is monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the renal tissue. The infiltration of monocytes/macrophages can be induced by chemotactic factors produced by renal cells. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent chemoattractant protein for monocyte recruitment. The objective of the present study was to investigate mechanisms of elevated MCP-1 expression in rat kidney during ischemia/reperfusion injury. Methods. The left kidney was subjected to one hour of ischemia followed by reperfusion for various time periods. The expression of MCP-1 mRNA was determined by nuclease protection assay and MCP-1 protein was identified by immunohistochemistry. Activation of a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the level of lipid peroxides in the kidney was measured. Results. There was a significant increase in MCP-1 expression in the ischemia/reperfusion kidney 2 hours after reperfusion (210% of the control). This increase was accompanied by activation of NF-κB, suggesting that this transcription factor might be involved in the event. The number of monocytes was significantly elevated in the kidney 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Pretreatment of rats with NF-κB inhibitors not only prevented NF-κB activation induced by ischemia/reperfusion, but also inhibited MCP-1 mRNA expression. Further analysis revealed that oxidative stress and increased IκB-α phosphorylation might be an underlying mechanism for NF-κB activation and subsequent MCP-1 mRNA expression in the ischemia/reperfusion kidney. Conclusion. The present study clearly demonstrates that enhanced MCP-1 expression in rat kidney during ischemia/reperfusion injury is mediated by NF-κB activation and oxidative stress. Elevated MCP-1 expression might be responsible for increased monocyte infiltration in the injured kidney.

0036379956	Cyclosporine a protects against apoptosis in ischaemic/reperfused rat kidneys	1. Renal ischaemia followed by reperfusion leads to acute renal failure in both native kidneys and renal allografts. Cyclosporine A (CsA) has been used as an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation. In the present study, the effect of CsA on ischaemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis in the kidney was investigated. 2. Ischaemia/reperfusion injury caused widespread apoptosis primarily in the medulla of the kidney. At 1.5 mg/kg per day, CsA significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in rat kidney after ischaemia/reperfusion injury. 3. Low-dose CsA treatment did not affect the levels of creatinine in the serum of rats after ischaemia/reperfusion injury.

79960563810	Radiotherapy may improve overall survival of patients with T3/T4 transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis or ureter and delay bladder tumour relapse	Background: Since transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the upper urinary tract is a relatively uncommon malignancy, the role of adjuvant radiotherapy is unknown.Methods: We treated 133 patients with TCC of the renal pelvis or ureter at our institution between 1998 and 2008. The 67 patients who received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgery were assigned to the radiation group (RT). The clinical target volume included the renal fossa, the course of the ureter to the entire bladder, and the paracaval and para-aortic lymph nodes, which were at risk of harbouring metastatic disease in 53 patients. The tumour bed or residual tumour was targeted in 14 patients. The median radiation dose administered was 50 Gy. The 66 patients who received intravesical chemotherapy were assigned to the non-radiation group (non-RT).Results: The overall survival rates for the RT and non-RT groups were not significantly different (p = 0.198). However, there was a significant difference between the survival rates for these groups based on patients with T3/T4 stage cancer. A significant difference was observed in the bladder tumour relapse rate between the irradiated and non-irradiated bladder groups (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis indicated that improved overall survival was associated with age < 60 years, T1 or T2 stage, absence of synchronous LN metastases, and EBRT. Acute gastrointestinal and bladder reactions were the most common symptoms, but mild non-severe (> grade 3) hematologic symptoms also occurred.Conclusion: EBRT may improve overall survival for patients with T3/T4 cancer of the renal pelvis or ureter and delay bladder tumour recurrence in all patients. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80053229598	Role of HLA-G and NCR in protection of umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cells from NK cell mediated cytotoxicity	Allogeneic umbilical cord blood haematopoietic stem cells (UCB-HSCs) can be transplanted into a host with the intact innate immunity with limited immuno-reaction, although the mechanisms remain unclear. The present studies aimed at investigating potential mechanisms of allogeneic UCB-HSCs escape from the cytolysis of natural killer (NK) cells. We compared UCB-HSCs ability to protect from NK-mediated cytotoxicity with peripheral blood or bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells (PB-HSCs and BM-HSCs). HSCs expressed lower levels of natural cytotoxicity receptor ligands including NKp30L, NKp44L and NKp46L than monocytes. Blocking these ligands respectively or in combination could increase the resistance of HSCs against NK cell mediated cytotoxicity. High expression of HLA-G was noticed on UCB-HSCs, rather than PB-HSCs or BM-HSCs, whereas blockade of HLA-G significantly elevated NK cell mediated cytolysis to UCB-HSCs. Thus, we conclude that natural cytotoxicity receptors and HLA-G on HSCs may contribute to the escape from NK cells, and activate and inhibitory NK cell receptors and their ligands can be novel therapeutic targets in cell transplantation. © 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2011 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

83655182747	Urinary metabolomics in monitoring acute tubular injury of renal allografts: A preliminary report	Acute tubular injury (ATI) is very common in biopsy specimens from renal allografts that suffer from delayed graft function (DGF) or dysfunction. Currently there are few reports on investigating small molecule metabolites in urine samples from transplant recipients as a noninvasive method to predict the ATI of renal allografts instead of an allograft biopsy. In our study matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTMS) was used to analyze small molecule metabolites in urine samples from renal transplant recipients with biopsy-proven slight ATI or moderate ATI or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). To evaluate the ATI-specific value of those small molecules, we applied the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) program. Mass spectra data were imported into the PCA, where loading graphs were constructed to express the constituents of the urine samples. Slight ATI, moderate ATI, or ATN of renal allografts were separated obviously in the loading graph. The position of urine samples in the graph may reflect the tubular injury status of allografts. A farther apart point from the original site may mean the allograft suffered from more severe ATI (even ATN), and vice versa. Detection of small molecule metabolites in urine samples of recipients through MALDI-FTMS may offer a promising noninvasive, high throughput, rapid tool to predict ATI/ATN of renal allografts. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

84859829499	Methylcap-seq reveals novel DNA methylation markers for the diagnosis and recurrence prediction of bladder cancer in a chinese population	Purpose: There is a need to supplement or supplant the conventional diagnostic tools, namely, cystoscopy and B-type ultrasound, for bladder cancer (BC). We aimed to identify novel DNA methylation markers for BC through genome-wide profiling of BC cell lines and subsequent methylation-specific PCR (MSP) screening of clinical urine samples. Experimental Design: The methyl-DNA binding domain (MBD) capture technique, methylCap/seq, was performed to screen for specific hypermethylated CpG islands in two BC cell lines (5637 and T24). The top one hundred hypermethylated targets were sequentially screened by MSP in urine samples to gradually narrow the target number and optimize the composition of the diagnostic panel. The diagnostic performance of the obtained panel was evaluated in different clinical scenarios. Results: A total of 1,627 hypermethylated promoter targets in the BC cell lines was identified by Illumina sequencing. The top 104 hypermethylated targets were reduced to eight genes (VAX1, KCNV1, ECEL1, TMEM26, TAL1, PROX1, SLC6A20, and LMX1A) after the urine DNA screening in a small sample size of 8 normal control and 18 BC subjects. Validation in an independent sample of 212 BC patients enabled the optimization of five methylation targets, including VAX1, KCNV1, TAL1, PPOX1, and CFTR, which was obtained in our previous study, for BC diagnosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 88.68% and 87.25%, respectively. In addition, the methylation of VAX1 and LMX1A was found to be associated with BC recurrence. Conclusions: We identified a promising diagnostic marker panel for early non-invasive detection and subsequent BC surveillance. © 2012 Zhao et al.

84862016265	Erythropoietin ameliorates renal ischemia and reperfusion injury via inhibiting tubulointerstitial inflammation	Background: Tubulointerstitial inflammation is the characteristics of renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) that is inevitable in kidney transplantation. Erythropoietin (EPO) has recently been shown to have protective effects on renal IRI by anti-apoptosis and anti-oxidation. Here, the effect and mechanism of EPO on renal IRI were further investigated, with a focus on tubulointerstitial inflammation. Materials and Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administrated with saline or EPO prior to IRI induced by bilateral renal pedicle clamping. Twenty-four hours following reperfusion, the effects of EPO on renal IRI were assessed by renal function and structure, tubulointerstitial myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive neutrophils, and proinflammatory mediator gene expression. The translocation and activity of NF-κB in renal tissues were also evaluated. Results: Compared with control groups, the EPO treated group exhibited lower serum urea and creatinine levels, limited tubular necrosis with a lower score of renal histological lesion. MPO positive cells in the tubulointerstitial area were greatly increased by IRI, but significantly reduced by the treatment of EPO. The gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and chemokine (MCP-1) was also significantly decreased by EPO. In addition, less activation and nuclear-translocation of NF-κB was observed in the kidney treated by EPO as well. Conclusion: EPO improved renal function and structure in IRI rats via reducing neutrophils in the tubulointerstitium, the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine, as well as the activation and nuclear-translocation of NF-κB. EPO may have potential clinical applications as an anti-inflammation agent clinically for a wide range of injury. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84863225918	Antithymocyte globulin-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome after renal transplantation: A case report	Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has long been used for immune-induction and anti-rejection treatments for solid organ transplantations. To date, few cases of ATG-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been published. Here, we present a case of ARDS caused by a single low-dose of ATG in a renal transplant recipient and the subsequent treatments administered. Although the patient suffered from ARDS and delayed graft function, he was successfully treated. We emphasize that the presence of such complications should be considered when unexplained respiratory distress occurs. Early use of corticosteroids, adjustment of immunosuppressive regimens, and conservative fluid management, as well as empiric antimicrobial therapies, may be effective strategies for the treatment of ARDS caused by ATG.

84863534976	Mycophenolate mofetil inhibits macrophage infiltration and kidney fibrosis in long-term ischemia-reperfusion injury	Immunosuppressants have been widely used in renal transplantation, in which ischemia-reperfusion injury is inevitable. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a relative novel immunosuppressant and also attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury in the acute phase, but its long-term effects are still obscure. Unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury model was established in Sprague-Dawley rats and 30 mg/kg/day MMF or natural saline was administered a day before the surgery. Renal function was monitored, and histological changes and fibrosis in the kidney were evaluated in both short and long terms. TGF-β1 secretion and MCP-1 expression were determined by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR respectively. The infiltration of macrophages in renal tissues was also assessed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). MMF treatment significantly improved renal function in ischemia-reperfusion injury rats in the short and long-term and also effectively prevented interstitial fibrosis. TGF-β1 secretion and MCP-1 expression in the renal tissue of MMF-treated rats were much lower than those in natural saline-treated rats, with much less macrophage infiltration as well. MMF treatment effectively prevented the deterioration of renal function and interstitial fibrosis in ischemia-reperfusion injury rats, which may be associated with decreased TGF-β1, MCP-1 and macrophages. These results provide evidence for the choice of MMF in the renal transplant patients not only for acute renal injury but also for long-term survival of renal allograft. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84865321756	Prevention of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by short hairpin RNA of endothelin A receptor in a rat model	Endothelin A receptor (ETaR) is a key molecule involved in a variety of biological events such as vessel contraction and inflammatory response in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. RNA interference using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a powerful tool to silence gene expression. Here, the effect of ETaR shRNA on I/R injury in rats was studied. A more effective shRNA sequence out of two constructed into plasmid vectors was selected using the A-10 cell line, and was then applied to a rat model. Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups: Sham, shRNA, vector and phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). Renal I/R injury was induced by clamping the left renal pedicle for one hour followed by reperfusion for 24 h. ETaR shRNA (100 mg) plasmid was administered by renal vein injection 48 h before clamping. The expression of both ETaR mRNA and protein was lowered by ETaR shRNA treatment compared with that in the vector and PBS groups; serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were significantly decreased; the semi-quantitative score of renal structural damage was improved; the mRNA level of endothelin 1 (ET-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) was reduced, but nitric oxide (NO) production in kidney tissues was increased (P <0.05). In conclusion, ETaR shRNA partially silenced ETaR expression in I/R injury kidneys, reduced the mRNA level of ET-1, inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2 and MCP-1, increased NO production, and ultimately improved renal function and structure. © 2008 Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

84865848520	Telocytes in the urinary system	Background: Telocytes, a new type of interstitial cells, have been identified in many organs in mammals. The present studies aimed at investigating the ultrastructure, distribution and interactions of telocytes with surrounding cells in the urinary system of rats, to confirm the existence of telocytes in kidneys, ureter and urinary bladder.Methods: Samples of kidney, ureter, or urinary bladder were harvested for the ultrastructure by the electron microscope. The primary culture of telocytes was performed to investigate the dynamic alterations.Results: Telocytes mainly located in the sub-capsular space of kidney, or between smooth muscle bundles and in the lamina propria of ureter and urinary bladder. Telocytes established numerous contacts with macrophages in the sub-capsular space of kidney, or with smooth muscle cells, nerve endings as well as blood capillaries in the ureter and urinary bladder. The complete morphology of telocytes with telopodes was observed clearly through the primary cell culture from the kidney tissues of rats.Conclusions: Our data evidenced the existence of telocytes in the urinary system, which may contribute to the tissue reparation and regeneration. © 2012 Zheng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84865532910	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation induces immunologic tolerance in renal transplant patients via modulation of inflammatory and repair processes	Background: Inducing donor-specific tolerance in renal transplant patients could potentially prevent allograft rejection and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity. Combined kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an HLA-matched donor is an exploratory and promising therapy to induce immune tolerance. Investigtion of molecular mechanisms involved in the disease is needed to understand the potential process of cell therapy and develop strategies to prevent this immunologic rejection.Methods: We enrolled nine patients in a clinical study in which cryopreserved donor hematopoietic stem cells were infused on days 2, 4, and 6 after kidney transplantation. One month post-transplant, 4 plasma samples were collected from combined transplants (C + Tx), and 8 plasma samples from patients with kidney transplantation alone (Tx). High abundance proteins in plasma were depleted and the two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with iTRAQ labeling was utilized to identify the protein profiling between the two groups. Clusters of up- and down-regulated protein profiles were submitted to MetaCore for the construction of transcriptional factors and regulation networks.Results and Discussion: Among the 179 identified proteins, 65 proteins were found in C + Tx with at least a 2-fold change as compared with Tx. A subset of proteins related to the complement and coagulation cascade, including complement C3a,complement C5a, precrusors to fibrinogen alpha and beta chains,was significantly downregulated in C + Tx. Meanwhile, Apolipoprotein-A1(ApoA1), ApoC1, ApoA2, ApoE, and ApoB were significantly lower in Tx compared to C + Tx. Gene ontology analysis showed that the dominant processes of differentially expressed proteins were associated with the inflammatory response and positive regulation of plasma lipoprotein particle remodeling.Conclusions: Thus, our study provides new insight into the molecular events in the hematopoietic stem cell-induced immunologic tolerance. © 2012 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84869745774	Analysis of microchimerism in living renal transplantation between mothers and children relationship	Objective: To compare the microchimeric and rejection rates in living donor kidney transplant recipients in mother and child relations and other relations. Methods: This retrospective single-center study enrolled 130 recipients to receive allografts from living related donors from 2004 to 2008 at our hospital. They were followed up for 1-5 years. The demographic data of the study population were analyzed by basic statistical methods. A total of 43 recipient blood samples were collected for the detection of microchimerism by the assays of short tandem repeat (STR) and sex-determining region-y gene (SRY) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The 1-year patient/graft survival rates were 93.8% and 92.3% respectively. And there was no significant differences between mother and child group and other relative group. Forty-six biopsy samples were collected from 46 recipients. Twenty-six (20.0%) cases had the occurrences of acute rejection episodes in different Banff degrees as proven by biopsy. 53.8% (14/26) cases were mother and child renal transplantation, higher than other relative (46.2%, 12/26). The mother donor kidney transplant recipients had about a twice higher rejection rate (30.4% vs 14.3%, P = 0.028) and a twice higher microchimeric rate(25.0% vs 14.8%)than other relative. Conclusion: Compared with other relations, the mother donor kidney recipients tend to have higher rates of microchimerism and acute rejection. And the special immune effect in mothers and children renal transplantation may influence its outcomes. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84870182399	Serum level of soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 in renal allograft recipients with acute rejection: A preliminary study	Background: Soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sfgl2), which is mainly secreted by T cells, is a novel effector of regulatory T cells with immunosuppressive functions. The aim of this study was to investigate serum levels of sfgl2 among renal allograft recipients. Methods: From November 2010 to August 2011 we retrospectively divided 47 renal allograft recipients into an acute rejection (n = 19) versus a stable group (n = 28) according to allograft biopsy results, using the Banff 2007 classification. The acute rejection group was subdivided into grade I (n = 8) versus grade II T-cell-mediated (n = 6) or antibody-mediated rejection episodes (n = 5). Peripheral blood samples were collected at the time of biopsy. Fourteen healthy volunteers were included as normal group controls. Serum levels of sfgl2 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Serum levels of sfgl2 were increased among renal allograft recipients suffering from biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes (61.91 ± 45.68 ng/mL), versus those with stable allografts (38.59 ± 19.92 ng/mL, P <.05) or healthy volunteers (29.10 ± 18.08 ng/mL, P <.05). The sfgl2 level was significantly higher among patients with antibody-mediated (118.48 ± 55.54 ng/mL) than T-cell-mediated acute rejection episodes (41.71 ± 16.44 ng/mL, P <.01). Serum sfgl2 levels were remarkably elevated in patients with grade II (51.87 ± 19.13 ng/mL) versus grade I T-cell-mediated rejection (34.10 ± 9.26 ng/mL, P <.05). Conclusions: Serum sfgl2 levels were increased among renal allograft recipients with acute rejection episodes to an extent dependent upon the pathological type and severity of the response.Copyright © 2012 Published by Elseiver Inc.

84871311500	Preliminary exploration in proteomic-based mechanistic analysis of patients with acute renal allograft rejection	Objective: To explore the application of proteomics in the mechanistic analysis of acute rejection (AR). Methods: Quantified proteomics with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling was utilized to identify the protein profiling between the transplantation patients with (n = 5) or without AR(n = 8) from 2008 to 2010. Results: Among the 179 identified proteins, 66 proteins in AR patients had at least a 2-fold change as compared with those without AR. The results demonstrated the dominant processes and responses associated with inflammation and complement activation. It was consistent with the underlying immune rejection associated with AR. Moreover, the results also indicated that high-coagulation state existed in AR patients. A number of transcription factors were identified in AR patients, including nuclear factor-κB, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.The analysis of transcription regulation networks suggested that the cross-talks among these key transcription factors might play an important role in the acute response and activation of coagulation system.

84871057035	Telocytes in the human kidney cortex	Renal interstitial cells play an important role in the physiology and pathology of the kidneys. As a novel type of interstitial cell, telocytes (TCs) have been described in various tissues and organs, including the heart, lung, skeletal muscle, urinary tract, etc. (www.telocytes.com). However, it is not known if TCs are present in the kidney interstitium. We demonstrated the presence of TCs in human kidney cortex interstitium using primary cell culture, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ immunohistochemistry (IHC). Renal TCs were positive for CD34, CD117 and vimentin. They were localized in the kidney cortex interstitial compartment, partially covering the tubules and vascular walls. Morphologically, renal TCs resemble TCs described in other organs, with very long telopodes (Tps) composed of thin segments (podomers) and dilated segments (podoms). However, their possible roles (beyond intercellular signalling) as well as their specific phenotype in the kidney remain to be established. © 2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2012 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84875604065	Helix B surface peptide administered after insult of ischemia reperfusion improved renal function, structure and apoptosis through beta common receptor/erythropoietin receptor and PI3K/Akt pathway in a murine model	Erythropoietin (EPO) has been well recognized as a tissue protective agent by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation. The tissue protective effect of EPO, however, only occurs at a high dosage, which may elicit severe side-effects at the meantime. Helix B surface peptide (HBSP), a novel peptide derived from the non-erythropoietic helix B of EPO, plays a specific role in tissue protection. We investigated effects of HBSP and the expression of its heterodimeric receptor, beta common receptor (βcR)/EPO receptor (), in a murine renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury model. HBSP significantly ameliorated renal dysfunction and tissue damage, decreased apoptotic cells in the kidney and reduced activation of caspase-9 and -3. The βcR/EPOR in the kidney was up-regulated by IR, but down-regulated by HBSP. Further investigation revealed that the expression and phosphorylation of Akt was dramatically enhanced by HBSP, but strongly reversed by wortmannin, the PI3K inhibitor. Wortmannin intervention improved βcR/EPOR expression, promoted caspase-9 and -3 activation, and increased active caspase-3 positive cells, while renal function and structure, and apoptotic cell counts scarcely changed. This result indicates a significant contribution of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the renoprotection of HBSP. The therapeutic effects of HBSP in this study suggest that HBSP could be a better candidate for renal protection. © 2013 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

84876357928	Naked caspase 3 small interfering RNA is effective in cold preservation but not in autotransplantation of porcine kidneys	Background: Caspase 3 associated with apoptosis and inflammation plays a key role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. The efficacy of naked caspase 3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proved in an isolated porcine kidney perfusion model but not in autotransplantation. Materials and methods: The left kidney was retrieved from mini pigs and infused with the University of Wisconsin solution with or without 0.3 mg of caspase 3 siRNA into the renal artery with the renal artery and vein clamped for 24-h cold storage (CS). After right nephrectomy, the left kidney was autotransplanted into the right for 48 h without systemic treatment of siRNA. Results: Fluorescent dye-labeled caspase 3 siRNA was visualized in the post-CS kidneys but was weakened after transplantation. The expression of caspase 3 messenger RNA and precursor was downregulated by siRNA in the post-CS kidneys. In the siRNA-preserved posttransplant kidneys, however, the caspase 3 messenger RNA and active subunit were upregulated with further decreased precursor but increased active caspase 3+ cells, apoptotic cells, and myeloperoxidase+ cells. Moreover, the renal tissue damage was aggravated by siRNA, whereas the renal function was not significantly changed. Conclusions: Naked caspase 3 siRNA administered into the kidney was effective in cold preservation but not enough to protect posttransplant kidneys, which might be because of systemic complementary responses overcoming local effects. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84876041917	Detection of crossing vessels with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) by computed tomography urography (CTU)	Objective: To assess the use of computed tomography urography (CTU) for the detection of crossing vessels with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). Methods: Twenty-one patients aged 18 to 62 yr (mean age, 32) who had been diagnosed with a UPJO were included retrospectively. Of the cases 8 were on the left and 13 on the right side. CTU was performed in every patient and intravenous urography was performed in 16 cases with retrograde ureteropyelography performed in 6 cases. Results: Twenty of 21 patients (95.2%) demonstrated crossing vessels at CTU examination. Fourteen of 16 patients demonstrated hydronephrosis in IVU examination with no patient detected the etiology. There were 20 arteries and one vein detected. All patients were confirmed crossing vessels with operation. Twelve cases were performed with open operation of vessel devascularization with 5 cases combined with pyeloplasty. Eight cases were performed with laparoscopic procedures of vessel devascularization with 2 cases combined with pyeloplasty. Nephrectomy was performed in 1 case. Conclusions: CTU can be recommended as first-line imaging modality for the detection of crossing vessels in patients with UPJO.

84879137868	An in vitro study of the correlation between the outer diameter of renal feeding arteries and the relative blood supply ratios in people with single accessory renal artery	Objective: To evaluate the correlation between the outer diameter ratios of renal feeding arteries and the volume ratios of tissues supplied by them in isolated kidneys with single accessory renal artery. Methods: Forty kidneys (19 left and 21 right) obtained from human cadaver donors with single accessory renal artery were investigated. The outer diameter of each renal artery and accessory renal artery were measured and the outer diameter ratios of renal feeding arteries (Dr) were calculated. Then colored cast specimens of tissue supplied by renal artery and accessory renal artery were made by acrylonitrile butradiene styrene (ABS) plastic respectively, meanwhile, volume of specimens were measured and the volume ratios (Vr) were calculated. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed to find out the correlation between Dr and Vr. Results: The average outer diameter of left renal artery and accessory renal artery were (7.31±1.68) mm and (3.69±1.55) mm. The average outer diameter of right renal artery and accessory renal artery were (7.39±1.82) mm and (3.79±1.32) mm. The average volume of cast specimens supplied by renal artery and accessory renal artery were (41.09±14.74) cm

84883677120	Innate immunity activation involved in unprotected porcine auto-transplant kidneys preserved by naked caspase-3 siRNA	Background: The naked caspase-3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) infused into the renal artery during cold preservation was effective, but did not protect auto-transplant porcine kidneys with increased inflammation and apoptosis in our previous study. The mechanisms involved, in particular, whether siRNA or complementary systemic feedback eliciting innate immune responses are worthy to be further investigated.Methods: The protein and mRNA expression of innate immunity-related molecules were detected by western blotting and quantitative PCR in the tissues previously collected from 48 h auto-transplant kidneys. The donor kidneys were retrieved from mini pigs and cold preserved by University of Wisconsin solution with/without 0.3 mg caspase-3 siRNA for 24 h.Results: The protein level of Toll like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and their main adapters, TRIF and MyD88, was up-regulated in the siRNA preserved auto-transplant kidneys. The mRNA level of NF-κB and c-Jun was increased, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and interferon (IFN)-α, β and γ. In addition, the non-TLR RNA sensor PKR protein, but not RIG1, was also increased in the siRNA preserved auto-transplant kidneys.Conclusions: The activation of innate immunity with amplified inflammatory responses in the caspase-3 siRNA preserved auto-transplant kidneys are associated with increased TLR3, TLR7 and PKR, which might be due to complementary systemic feedback, although persistent actions initiated by short-acting caspase-3 siRNA cannot be completely ruled out. These results provided valuable evidence to guide future siRNA design and pre-clinic studies. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84886489477	Combination of caspofungin and low-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in renal transplant recipients	Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a severe and life-threatening complication in immunocompromised patients. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is well known for its effectiveness as prophylaxis of PJP. However, the use of TMP-SMZ is associated with various adverse effects that may not be tolerated by critically ill patients. Caspofungin is recommended for invasive fungal infections, but the treatment of PJP after solid organ transplantation (SOT) is an off-label use of this drug. In this study, three cases of severe PJP in renal transplant recipients treated with a combination of caspofungin and low-dose TMP-SMZ were presented. Initial findings indicated that the combined treatment may be beneficial for the treatment of PJP and decrease the incidence of TMP-SMZ-related adverse effects. © 2013 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

84888868176	Protective effects of HBSP on ischemia reperfusion and cyclosporine a induced renal injury	Ischemia reperfusion (IR) and cyclosporine A (CsA) injuries are unavoidable in kidney transplantation and are associated with allograft dysfunction. Herein, the effect and mechanism of a novel tissue protective peptide, helix B surface peptide (HBSP) derived from erythropoietin, were investigated in a rat model. The right kidney was subjected to 45 min ischemia, followed by left nephrectomy and 2-week reperfusion, with or without daily treatment of CsA 25 mg/kg and/or HBSP 8 nmol/kg. Blood urea nitrogen was increased by CsA but decreased by HBSP at 1 week and 2 weeks, while the same changes were revealed in urinary protein/creatinine only at 2 weeks. HBSP also significantly ameliorated tubulointerstitial damage and interstitial fibrosis, which were gradually increased by IR and CsA. In addition, apoptotic cells, infiltrated inflammatory cells, and active caspase-3+ cells were greatly reduced by HBSP in the both IR and IR + CsA groups. The 17 kD active caspase-3 protein was decreased by HBSP in the IR and IR + CsA kidneys, with decreased mRNA only in the IR + CsA kidneys. Taken together, it has been demonstrated, for the first time, that HBSP effectively improved renal function and tissue damage caused by IR and/or CsA, which might be through reducing caspase-3 activation and synthesis, apoptosis, and inflammation. © 2013 Yuanyuan Wu et al.

84888128270	Modulation of allogeneic CD8+ T-cell response by DZNep controls GVHD while preserving hematopoietic chimerism	BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) combined with solid-organ transplantation is a feasible method to achieve long-lasting organ allograft tolerance through the induction of hematopoietic chimerism in recipients. However, the allo-HSCT engraftment puts recipients at risk of life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Novel immunomodulatory approaches are required to effectively control GVHD while preserving the status of hematopoietic chimerism. We have reported that histone methylation inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) can control ongoing GVHD in mice by selectively inducing apoptosis of alloreactive effector T cells. METHODS: Using donor-derived CD8 T cell-mediated mouse GVHD model, we further investigated the effect of in vivo administration of DZNep on allogeneic CD8 T cell response and the hematopoietic chimerism in recipients. RESULTS: We found that DZNep delayed the in vivo proliferation of donor-derived alloreactive CD8 T cells and also reduced the interleukin-2 production by these T cells. Moreover, DZNep treatment resulted in a significant decrease of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, granzyme B, TRAIL, and Fas ligand expressing donor-derived CD8 T cells, suggesting a multilevel modulation role on T-cell survival and effect in vivo. Notably, DZNep treatment did not hamper the generation of hematopoietic chimerism in recipients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that modulation of histone methylation through DZNep may be a potential strategy for the induction of hematopoietic chimerism to achieve donor-specific organ allograft tolerance through donor allo-HSCT combined with solid-organ transplantation.

84892411776	The protective effect of baicalin against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury through inhibition of inflammation and apoptosis	Background: Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) increases the rates of acute kidney failure, delayed graft function, and early mortality after kidney transplantation. The pathophysiology involved includes oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune-mediated injury. The anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-inflammation properties of baicalin, a flavonoid glycoside isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis, have been verified. This study therefore assessed the effects of baicalin against renal IRI in rats. Methods: Baicalin was intraperitoneally injected 30 min before renal ischemia. Serum and kidneys were harvested 24 h after reperfusion. Renal function and histological changes were assessed. Markers of oxidative stress, the Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 signaling pathway, mitochondrial stress, and cell apoptosis were also evaluated. Results: Baicalin treatment decreased oxidative stress and histological injury, and improved kidney function, as well as inhibiting proinflammatory responses and tubular apoptosis. Baicalin pretreatment also reduced the expression of TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, p-NF-κB, and p-IκB proteins, as well as decreasing caspase-3 activity and increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Conclusions: Baicalin may attenuate renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting proinflammatory responses and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These effects are associated with the TLR2/4 signaling pathway and mitochondrial stress. © 2014 Lin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84893934887	The regulatory T cell effector soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 induces tubular epithelial cell apoptosis in renal transplantation	Acute rejection (AR) hinders renal allograft survival. Tubular epithelial cell (TEC) apoptosis contributes to premature graft loss in AR, while the mechanism remains unclear. Soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFGL2), a novel effector of regulatory T cells (Treg), induces apoptosis to mediate tissue injury. We previously found that serum sFGL2 significantly increased in renal allograft rejection patients. In this study, the role of sFGL2 in AR was further investigated both in vivo and in vitro. The serum level of sFGL2 and the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg in the peripheral blood were measured in renal allograft recipients with AR or stable renal function (n = 30 per group). The human TEC was stimulated with sFGL2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, or phosphate buffered saline and investigated for apoptosis in vitro. Apoptosis-associated genes expression in TEC was further assessed. Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Fudan University. Our results showed that the serum level of sFGL2, correlated with Treg in the peripheral blood, was significantly increased in the AR patients. In vitro, sFGL2 remarkably induced TEC apoptosis, with a significant up-regulation of proapoptotic genes, including CASP-3, CASP-8, CASP-9, CASP-10, TRADD, TNFSF10, FADD, FAS, FASLG, BAK1, BAD, BAX, and NF-KB1. However, no significant changes were observed in the expression of antiapoptotic genes, including CARD-18, NAIP, BCL2, IKBKB, and TBK1. Therefore, sFGL2, an effector of Treg, induces TEC apoptosis. Our study suggests that sFGL2 is a potential mediator in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection and provides novel insights into the role of Treg in AR. © 2014 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

84896711948	Moderate-dose glucocorticoids as salvage therapy for severe pneumonia in renal transplant recipients: A single-center feasibility study	This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of moderate-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) with mechanical ventilation as salvage therapy for renal transplant recipients with severe pneumonia, which was non-responsive to conventional treatment. A retrospective study was conducted involving renal transplant recipients diagnosed with severe pneumonia and did not respond to conventional treatment. All immunosuppressants were then completely withdrawn, and the patients were initially administered with methylprednisolone at doses of 2.0-2.5mg/kg/day once every 12h. This dosage was continued until oxygenation improved, and the treatment was gradually tapered (by 20mg every 2-3 days) to the previous maintenance dosage. Ten patients were recruited from year 2008 to 2012. Two patients who underwent emergency endotracheal intubation were intubated on days 3 and 8, respectively, another one died from recurrent pneumothorax. The mean PaO2/FiO2 of the nine survivors was significantly increased by the increasing treatment duration; whereas the lung injury scores (LIS) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were both significantly decreased. The use of moderate-dose GCs may play a role as salvage therapy for renal transplant recipients with severe pneumonia. However, further study with larger trials to is needed. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc. All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

84896723023	Increased peripheral and local soluble FGL2 in the recovery of renal ischemia reperfusion injury in a porcine kidney auto-transplantation model	Background: Regulatory T cells (Treg) protect kidney against ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury via suppressing innate immunity, but the mechanism has not been fully clarified. Soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFGL2), a novel effector of Treg, may affect apoptosis and inflammation. This study investigated the role of sFGL2 in renal IR injury in a porcine kidney auto-transplantation model.Materials and methods: The left kidney was retrieved from mini pigs and infused by University of Wisconsin solution into the renal artery with the renal artery and vein clamped for 24-h cold storage. After the right nephrectomy, the left kidney was auto-transplanted into the right for 2 weeks. 3 pigs were sacrificed at day 2, 5, 7, 10 and 14 post-transplantation respectively. Collected renal tissues and daily blood samples were stored for further analyses.Results: Both serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were maximized during day 2 to 5 and followed by a gradual recovery over 2 weeks. The similar pattern were showed in histological damage, myeloperoxidase + cells and apoptosis in the kidney, as well as circulating TNF-α and IFN-γ. Serum sFGL2 presented a fluctuating increase and reached a peak at day 10. The expression of sFGL2 and its receptor FcγRIIB as well as Foxp3 and IL-10 in the kidney was notably increased from day 5 to 10.Conclusion: The increased sFGL2 together with FcγRIIB during renal recovery after IR injury suggested that sFGL2 might be a potential renoprotective mediator involved in the renal self-repairing and remodeling in this 2-week porcine auto-transplantation model. © 2014 Zhao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84896791615	Mini-flank supra-12th rib incision for open partial nephrectomy compared with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and traditional open partial nephrectomy	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report our approach of partial nephrectomy (PN) using a supra-12th rib mini-flank incision. We compared mini-incision open partial nephrectomy (MI-OPN) with open partial nephrectomy (OPN) and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) to verify whether MI-OPN can be an alternative to OPN and LPN. Methods: This was a retrospective single-center study including 194 patients who underwent partial nephrectomy (PN) between February 2005 and December 2010. Demographic, perioperative, and complication data were compared among the MI-OPN group, OPN group and LPN group. Results: No statistical differences were reported in either group for age, sex, BMI, tumour side (right or left kidney), RENAL nephrometry scores, PADUA score and preoperative eGFR. The operative time was longer in LPN group when compared with MI-OPN and OPN group (all P<0.001). The warm ischemia time of LPN group was longer than MI-OPN group (P = 0.032) and OPN group (P = 0.005). The length of stay of LPN group was shorter than OPN group (P = 0.018), but was similar to MIOPN group (P = 0.094). The incidence of renal artery clamping was lower in OPN group when compared with MI-OPN and LPN group (all P<0.001). More estimated blood loss was found in OPN group when compared with MI-OPN group (p = 0.003) and LPN group (P = 0.014). The overall incidence of postoperative complications was similar. Conclusions: The approach of MI-OPN can couple the benefits of both minimally invasive and open partial nephrectomy techniques with less estimated blood loss, shorter operative time, shorter length of stay, less postoperative complications, and a smaller incision. MI-OPN may be an effective alternative to laparoscopic or traditional open approaches, which maybe more suitable for the tumors with high RENAL nephrometry score or PADUA score. © 2014 Wang et al.

84902553506	The role of soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 in transplantation: Protection or damage	Soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFGL2) is the soluble form of fibrinogen like protein 2. As a novel immunoregulatory molecule, sFGL2 is secreted mainly by T cells, especially regulatory T cells, and exerts an immunoregulatory property rather than a prothrombinase function in the immune system. sFGL2 changes not only the proliferation and differentiation of T cells but also the maturation of antigen presenting cells. Besides its innate and adaptive immunoregulatory functions, sFGL2 also induces apoptosis in cells including renal tubular epithelial cells through Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). It may affect transplantation via regulation of immunity and induction of apoptosis of different cells in a spatiotemporal manner. Here, we review the research progresses on sFGL2 including its structure, functions, and molecular mechanisms via which sFGL2 might affect organ transplantation, as well as discuss its characteristics and potential of becoming a therapeutic target in patients with rejection. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84902595044	Influencing factors of new-onset diabetes after a renal transplant and their effects on complications and survival rate	Objective: To discuss the onset of and relevant risk factors for new-onset diabetes after a transplant (NODAT) in patients who survive more than 1 year after undergoing a renal transplant and the influence of these risk factors on complications and long-term survival. Method: A total of 428 patients who underwent a renal transplant between January 1993 and December 2008 and were not diabetic before surgery were studied. The prevalence rate of and relevant risk factors for postoperative NODAT were analyzed on the basis of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and differences in postoperative complications and survival rates between patients with and without NODAT were compared. Results: The patients in this study were followed up for a mean of 5.65 ± 3.68 years. In total, 87 patients (20.3%) developed NODAT. Patients who converted from treatment with CSA to FK506 had increased prevalence rates of NODAT (P <0.05). Multi-factor analysis indicated that preoperative FPG level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48), age (OR = 1.10), body mass index (OR = 1.05), hepatitis C virus infection (OR = 2.72), and cadaveric donor kidney (OR = 1.18) were independent risk factors for NODAT (All P <0.05). Compared with the N-NODAT group, the NODAT group had higher prevalence rates (P < 0.05) of postoperative infection, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; in addition, the survival rate and survival time of the 2 groups did not significantly differ. Conclusion: Among the patients who survived more than 1 year after a renal transplant, the prevalence rate of NODAT was 20.32%. Preoperative FPG level, age, body mass index, hepatitis C virus infection, and cadaveric donor kidney were independent risk factors for NODAT. Patients who converted from treatment with CSA to FK506 after a renal transplant had aggravated impairments in glycometabolism. Patients with NODAT were also more vulnerable to postoperative complications such as infection, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. © 2014 Lv et al.

84904752275	Renal telocytes contribute to the repair of ischemically injured renal tubules	Telocytes (TCs), a distinct type of interstitial cells, have been identified in many organs via electron microscopy. However, their precise function in organ regeneration remains unknown. This study investigated the paracrine effect of renal TCs on renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) in vitro, the regenerative function of renal TCs in renal tubules after ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in vivo and the possible mechanisms involved. In a renal IRI model, transplantation of renal TCs was found to decrease serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, while renal fibroblasts exerted no such effect. The results of histological injury assessments and the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 were consistent with a change in kidney function. Our data suggest that the protective effect of TCs against IRI occurs via inflammation-independent mechanisms in vivo. Furthermore, we found that renal TCs could not directly promote the proliferation and anti-apoptosis properties of TECs in vitro. TCs did not display any advantage in paracrine growth factor secretion in vitro compared with renal fibroblasts. These data indicate that renal TCs protect against renal IRI via an inflammation-independent pathway and that growth factors play a significant role in this mechanism. Renal TCs may protect TECs in certain microenvironments while interacting with other cells. © 2014 The Authors.

12344330482	Effect of astrgaloside IV on long-term MCP-1 expression in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat	Purpose: To elucidate long-term effect of astrgaloside IV on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury(IRI) in the rat. Methods: Fifty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g) were randomized into IRI group, astrgaloside IV (Astr) group and Sham operation group(as control). 10% (g/L) astrgaloside IV 2mL was given by daily gavage in Astr groups during operation for 6 days, other groups treated with equal dose of normal saline. After right kidney was removed, the renal artery of the left kidney were occluded with a vascular clamp for 60 minutes. Animals were killed at 4, 12 and 24 weeks and kidney were havested for expression of MCP-1 mRNA and protein determination, collagen staining and monitoring proteinuria, serum creatinine (Cr) were also performed. Results: Animals in IRI group developed progressive proteinuria from 4 weeks onwards, expression of MCP-1 and scores of collagen staining were also significantly increased. At 12 and 24 weeks after operation, changes in Astr group above were significantly decreased than that of animals in IRI group(P<0.05), though higher than that of Sham group(P>0.05). Conclusions: Astrgaloside IV markedly ameliorated renal injury by downregulation of MCP-1 expression.

84921853368	Network analysis reveals roles of inflammatory factors in different phenotypes of kidney transplant patients	Background: Systems-level characterization of inflammation in kidney transplantation remains incomplete. By stratifying kidney transplant patients based on phenotypes, the present study sought to identify the role of inflammatory proteins in disease progress and assess potential biomarkers for allograft monitoring. Methods: Kidney transplant patients with different allograft status were enrolled in the study: stable renal function (ST), impaired renal function (UNST), acute rejection (AR), and chronic rejection (CR). We stratified the patients into 3 phenotype levels according to their symptoms and pathogenesis. Serum protein concentrations were measured by a quantitative protein array. All differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) to highlight protein interactions in patients with the above dysfunction levels. We identified level-related proteins and evaluated the classification efficiency of these biomarkers based on leave-one-out validation. The candidate proteins related to phenotype transforming were annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Results: Based on the hypothesis that common proteins and their up- or down-regulation promote disease progress, we obtained 12 common proteins and 11 level-specific proteins from the phenotype-related PPINs. The common proteins were annotated for KEGG enrichment: (1) cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction; (2) hematopoietic cell lineage; (3) Jak-STAT signaling pathway; (4) allograft rejection; and (5) T cell receptor signaling pathway. The level-specific proteins could be potential biomarkers with diagnostic value. The classification potency of the 11 level-specific proteins (IL-1R-1, IL-16, TIMP-1, G-CSF, MIG, IL-11, BLC, TNF-β, Eotaxin-2, I-309 and IL-6 sR) was better than the performance using all 40 proteins. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the potential value of PPINs-based approach to understanding inflammation-derived mechanisms and developing diagnostic biomarkers. Independent evaluations are required to further estimate the clinical relevance of the new diagnostic biomarkers.
