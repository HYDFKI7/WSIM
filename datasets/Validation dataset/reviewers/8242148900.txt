17844395177	Dynamic analysis of hydrodynamic bearing-rotor system based on neural network	Feed-forward neural network is employed to model the nonlinear oil-film force database of a finite-length hydrodynamic journal bearing, which is constructed by continuous transformation of Reynolds equation. Neural network models trained are utilized to investigate motion characteristics of a rigid unbalanced rotor supported on elliptical bearings in 300 MW steam turbine generator set. There exist various forms of periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motions at different rotating speeds. Periodic doubling bifurcation and quasi-periodic routes to chaos may be found when rotating speed is used as the control parameter.

2642551329	The eddy losses of a magnetic thrust bearing	Accurate calculations of losses associated with the operation of magnetic bearings are particularly important for high speed applications where the rotor losses are expected to be large and for some particular applications where even low power losses will be critical. Power losses in the magnetic thrust bearing is often neglected, but if there is misaligned in the rotor and bearing, the magnetic field in the thrust bearing is no longer axisymmetric one, or the dynamic control current in the winding is time dependent one, eddy currents are caused to flow inside the conducting material, then the power losses are very important for magnetic bearing design. This paper presents an analytical model of a thrust magnetic bearing, and the magnetic fields, forces and losses of thrust magnetic bearing are calculated. In the calculations the frequency of dynamic control current is up to 1 000 Hz, rotating speed is from 60 rpm to 1 200 rpm, and the non-linearity of material is also taken into consideration. The results shows that if the magnetic field is not saturation, the eddy losses is proportional to dynamic control current frequency and a square function of dynamic control current, and also 5/2 power function of shafts speed.

3142701239	Analysis of dynamic performance of spiral seals for liquid	The finite element method is adopted to solve the Reynolds equation of spiral seals, and two dimensional pressure distribution of mechanical seals is presented. The seal dynamic properties, such as stiffness coefficients, damping coefficients, torque stiffness coefficients and torque damping coefficients, are analyzed. The dynamic properties of the herringbone spiral seal are calculated, and the influences of the rotating speed and clearance on the dynamic properties of the seal are studied. The calculation results show that if the clearance of the mechanical seal is large enough (>10 μm) the dynamic influences of the seal liquid can be neglected, and the damping coefficients and torque damping coefficients hardly change with the variation of rotating speed, but change greatly with the seal clearance. At high rotating speed the stiffness coefficients and torque stiffness coefficients increase at first and then decrease with the increasing of seal clearance; if the rotating speed is low, the stiffness coefficients and torque stiffness coefficients decrease with increasing of seal clearance, and within some regions the stiffness coefficients and torque stiffness coefficients may even be negative, which leads the mechanical seal system to instability.

33746145118	Influence of the mechanical seals on the dynamic performance of rotor-bearing systems	In this paper, to consider the effects of mechanical seals, a lumped-mass model and the transfer matrix method are used to establish the equations for the dynamics performance of rotor-bearing system. The general inverted iteration method is also used to solve the eigenvalue problem of these equations. To check the response of the rotor-bearing system under unbalance motivation, the Gauss method is used to calculate the dynamic response of the constrained vibration. The results, based on the dynamic properties calculation of a typical mechanical spiral seal, such as stiffness coefficients and damping coefficients, exert the influence of the mechanical seal on the rotor-bearing system of the high-speed machinery. Meanwhile, some structure parameters that may affect the dynamic performance and forced vibration under unbalance motivation of the rotor-bearing system considering mechanical seals are analyzed in the paper. The analysis results show that the mechanical seal more or less has effects on the rotor-bearing system. The mechanical seal has much more effects on the flexible rotor-bearing system than on the rigid one. For instance, in a certain case, if the effects of the mechanical seal were taken into account, the systems critical speed may increase by 70-80%. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2006.

33645756387	Static and dynamic characteristics of hydrodynamic mechanical seal	For the mechanical seal with spiral groove on its surface applied in the high-speed turbo-pump, a thermal model of the mechanical seal considering leakage and thermal-conduction had been presented. The solutions of static and dynamic characteristics of this type of mechanical seal were introduced. The influences of working parameters on the basic static characteristics such as opening force, leakage and power loss, and the dynamic characteristics such as stiffness and damping were discussed. The results show when the film thickness is less than 5 μm, the rotating speed has great effect on the opening force, stiffness and damping, while it has little effect on leakage. When hydrodynamic mechanical seal works under the thinner film thickness (<3 μm) conditions, the higher power loss and the higher temperature rise are inevitable, but the seal provides higher stiffness and lower leakage.

4644340609	Nonlinear oil-film force database of journal bearing including inlet pressure	The method to establish the continuous nonlinear oil-film force database of hydrodynamic journal bearing including the inlet pressure boundary condition was developed by use of the nonlinear transformation of Reynolds equations, which contributed to extending the application fields of the database method to compute nonlinear oil-film forces of finite-length journal bearings. The continuous nonlinear oil-film force database and the calculation models with better conformity to practical working conditions were established by introducing two new parameters with finite ranges to realize the finite treatment of the rotor axes velocity and the inlet pressure boundary condition. The finite element method (FEM) and the established database method were comparatively employed to calculate the oil-film forces of an elliptical bearing at any movement state of the axes. It was found that the results based on the database method were almost identical to those based on the FEM solutions. Thus the established nonlinear oil-film force database was applicable to analyzing the transient movement of a rotor system with convenience and good precision.

The round bearing was made of 45# steel with babbitt alloy bushing and the bearing journal was made of 45# steel. High stress of the water content of 0%, 1%,3% in lubricant, 10 times of a normal load of 2200 N, and the rotating speeds at 500, 1000, 2000 rpm were adopted in accelerated experiment. A quantitative index of particle coverage area (IPCA) together with wear debris ferro-image was used to characterize wear degree and wear mechanisms. Three wear stages with corresponding wear debris ferro-images were identified from IPCA variations characterized by bathtub curve trend. The first one was running-in stage characterized by the highest wear debris producing rate and higher large debris content. The second one was normal wear stage characterized by the lowest wear debris producing rate and small normal debris. The final one was failure initiation stage characterized by higher wear debris producing rate and higher large debris content. The corresponding dominant wear mechanisms were micro-ploughing and micro-cutting induced by rough initial surfaces in the running-in stage, local rub due to vibration in the normal stage, and fatigue and abrasive wear in the failure initiation stage. © 2008 Trans Tech Publications.

64049114946	The finite element with generalized coefficients for stress intensity factor	The stress intensity factor (SIF) is an important parameter for structural fracture analysis. The conventional finite element method (FEM) with singular elements was often adopted for SIF calculation in engineering applications, in which displacement or stress components had to be used to attain the SIF at points locating along specified lines in singular domain around the crack tip. In this paper, the Williams series is modified and a Williams macro element is presented for SIF calculation on the basis of the method of finite element with generalized degrees of freedom (FEDOFs). The displacement model for FEDOFs is derived in the singular domain, based on which the SIF near the crack tip can be obtained directly. The influence of some important parameters in the Williams element on the precision of computing results is examined and discussed. The recommended values for these parameters, including the ratio factor of radial discretization, the number of radial discretizing mesh and terms of series, are given based on detailed parametric study. Examples show that the Williams element with Generalized DOFs is more convenient and accurate for SIF analysis than the conventional FEM with singular element.

High-purity Nb, Cr, and Ni crystalline powders were milled for periods up to 35 h. These powders were vacuum sintered at 1250C for 0.5 h under 45 MPa. The phase transformations of NbCr2-Ni Laves phases have been investigated by X-ray diffraction. The grain size decreases and the microstrain increases with increased Ni content. Different phase transformations were observed from NbCr2-Ni intermetallics. It is found that the electron concentration and phase stability correlation is obeyed in the Nb-Cr-Ni systems. However, the electron concentration corresponding to the C15/C14 phase transition is found to move to a higher value (i.e. 6.103) than the predicted one (i.e. 5.88) in the literature. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

70349658788	The influence of sea water in oil emulsion on bearing performance	The lubricant in the bearings of ships can be easily polluted by sea water. Too much sea water may deteriorate the bearing performance and result in catastrophic failure; therefore, the lubricant should be changed regularly to prevent this. It is important to investigate the effect of adding sea water to mineral oil on the tribological performance of these bearings. In the present study, different amounts of sea water of 1, 2, and 3 per cent (by mass) were mixed with a typical mineral oil with a viscosity of 46 mm<sup>2</ sup>/s at 40 °C and tested in 12 identical journal bearings under different operation conditions of rotational speed and load. For each case, the temperature within the oil film, the loci of the shaft centre, the power consumption, and the viscosity of the emulsion were measured. In parallel to these measurements, a CFD simulation was performed for the test bearings to estimate the friction force and load capacity. The experimental measurements and the computational predictions were compared. A maximum amount of sea water that can be tole-rated in the mineral oil was established for the normal working conditions of the journal bearing.

The bearing is a LBP four-pad tilting pad journal bearing with the diameter of 152.15 mm and a length to diameter ratio of 0.703. The clearance ratio of the bearing is 0.0021, and the static load applied on the bearing is 10 kN, 20 kN, 30 kN and 40 kN respectively. The maximum rotation speed of the bearing is 6000 r/min, and the ratio of the excitation frequency to the frequency of the rotating shaft ranges from 0.43 to 2.0. The magnitude of the excitation force is controlled to make sure that the bearing has a linear behavior in operation. It is found that under different frequencies of dynamic exciting force, the theoretically calculated coefficients of the bearing are quite different from the experimental results. It is also found that the variation of the excitation frequency in the experiment has a less effect on both stiffness and damping coefficients than that predicted by the theoretical method.

77953683363	Application of computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction method to the lubrication study of a rotor-bearing system	Computational methods were used to analyse the elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication of a complex rotor-bearing system. The methodology employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based on the Navier-Stokes equation and a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) technique. A series of models representing the system were built using the CFD-FSI methodology to investigate the interaction between the lubrication of the fluid film, and elastic dynamics of the rotor and journal bearing. All models followed an assumption of isothermal behaviour. The FSI methodology was implemented by setting nodal forces and displacements to equilibrium at the fluid-structure interface, therefore allowing the lubrication of the fluid and the elastic deformation of structures to be solved simultaneously. This is significantly different to the more common techniques-such as the Reynolds equation method-that use an iterative solution to balance the imposed load and the force resulting from the pressure of the fluid film to within a set tolerance. Predictions using the CFD-FSI method were compared with the results of an experimental study and the predictions from an 'in-house' lubrication code based on the Reynolds equation. The dynamic response of the system was investigated with both rigid and flexible bodies for a range of different bearing materials and dynamic unbalanced loads. Cavitation within the fluid film was represented in the CFD-FSI method using a simplified phase change boundary condition. This allowed the transition between the liquid and vapour phases to be derived from the lubricant's properties as a function of pressure. The combination of CFD and FSI was shown to be a useful tool for the investigation of the hydrodynamic and elasto-hydrodynamic lubrications of a rotor-bearing system. The elastic deformation of the bearing and dynamic unbalanced loading of the rotor had significant effects on the position of its locus. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

To investigate the interaction of the dynamics and elastic deformation of the shaft and the lubrication of the journal bearing, a pure fluid bearing model and a rotor-bearing FSI model were created. The shaft was modelled as rigid and elastic respectively. Three different boundary conditions: Sommerfeld, Gümbel and cavitation, were employed and compared in this study. The cavitation boundary was implemented based on the phase change caused by the pressure change between a liquid phase and a vapor phase. The load applied on the model was in the vertical direction, with a rotational velocity, representative of real working conditions of an experiment of a marine journal bearing. The results for the hydrodynamic case were compared with an in-house lubrication code based on Reynolds equation and the Reynolds boundary condition, and showed that the phase change method was adequate to deal with the cavitation problem of a rotor-bearing system. FSI was shown to be a powerful tool for the investigation of the hydrodynamic and elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication of a rotor-bearing system. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.

77955262330	Nonsphericity of bearing geometry and lubrication in hip joint implants	A general elastohydrodynamic lubrication model was developed to consider the nonsphericity of the bearing geometry in hip joint implants, both under the steady and transient conditions. The articulation between the femoral head and the acetabular cup was represented by a nominal ball-in-socket configuration. The nonsphericity was introduced on the acetabular cup and femoral head bearing surfaces in the form of an ellipsoidal surface represented by variations of the radii of curvature given by the three semi-axis lengths of the ellipsoid with regard to a nominal spherical surface. An appropriate spherical coordinate system and solution domain discretization were used to facilitate the numerical simulations. Both the equivalent discrete spherical convolution model and the corresponding spherical fast Fourier transform technique were used to evaluate the elastic deformation of either the spherical or nonspherical bearing surfaces. A fixedtracked method was also developed to simulate the complex morphology introduced by moving the interface of the nonspherical bearing surfaces. The general methodology for the nonspherical bearing was first applied to investigate the steady-state elastohydrodynamic lubrication of an ellipsoidal cup articulating against a spherical head in a typical metal-on-metal hip joint implant. Subsequently, the problem of an ellipsoidal head articulating against a spherical cup was considered under the transient conditions. The significance of nonsphericity of bearing geometry in hip joint implants due to manufacturing, designing, and wear was discussed. The results obtained showed that the effect of a nonspherical bearing surface geometry on elastohydrodynamic lubrication was dependent on the orientation, the magnitude, and the deviation direction of the nonsphericity. A well-controlled nonsphericity was seen to be beneficial for improving the lubrication. © 2009 by ASME.

To understand the influence of different parameters on the biomechanics of the total hip replacement (THR) and improve its design, two numerical approaches were developed and implemented in finite element models to investigate the coupling between the dynamics response and the contact mechanics for three different THR configurations, metal-on-polyethylene (MOP), metal-on-metal (MOM), and ceramic-on-ceramic (COC). The dynamic force and the contact pressure distribution at the bearing surfaces from the two methods were predicted and compared. The influences of various parameters (motion angle, load applied in the pendulum, friction coefficient, geometry, and material properties) were subsequently investigated. From the comparisons, the decoupled method, based on the rigid-body dynamics and the quasi-static elastic contact mechanics, was adequate to predict the performance of the THRs efficiently. The load had the greatest influence on the dynamics/contact mechanics among other factors.

Based on the theory of fracture mechanics and finite element method, this paper focuses on the numerical simulation of the reflective crack propagation path in asphalt overlay under the partial wheel load. Calculation result and analysis show that reflective crack partially expands upwards at the side of wheel load under the effect of partial wheel load with a sequential increase of crack propagation length. As the crack propagation length increases, stress intensity factors grow rapidly in the early period, and then increase by degrees slowly and, in the later period, the amplitude grows increasingly. Stress and strain fields enhance as the reflective crack increases upwards and the crack propagation angle expands gradually with the increase of reflective crack propagation length. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

The singular region around the crack tip is evenly divided alone the tangent direction into several triangular elements, which can be approximated by the modified Williams series. This element is further refined along the radial direction by a number of quadrilateral micro-elements as well as a triangular micro-element neighboring to the crack tip, whose displacement fields can be developed according to the conventional finite element method. The nodal displacements of the micro-element should be governed by the global displacement field of the triangular element, so that the triangular Williams element with generalized DOFs is presented for discretizing the singular region around the crack tip and can be used to evaluate directly the stress intensity factor at the crack tip. The influence of the radial scale factor, the number of discretized elements and the terms of Williams series on the results is discussed. Examples provided demonstrate that the triangular Williams element is insensitive to the size of singular region with satisfied convergency and accuracy.

84860485808	A novel active online electromagnetic balancing method-principle and structure analysis	Vibrations caused by the imbalance of a rotor are a frequently encountered problem in machining processes. Especially in high-precision finishing, the workpiece quality is strongly related to the vibration of the machine-tool spindle, which is mainly caused by mass imbalance and cannot be completely eliminated in cutting tools with nonaxisymmetrical structures. An imbalance in centrifugal force is generated by rotor rotation and increases rapidly with rotational speed. A novel active online electromagnetic balancing method based on static magnetic-field analysis is proposed, and an active online electromagnetic balancing device (AOEBD) based on this method was developed under these conditions. The magnetic-field distribution and electromagnetic force generated by the device were analyzed by finite-element modeling. The influence on the electromagnetic force of the misalignment between the rotor and the iron core was investigated. Factors influencing the magnetic force of the device were determined, and reasonable reference values were suggested. The critical eccentricity was also provided. Experiments had been done at last, and the experimental results presented a good performance of this kind of balancing device. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

0038274880	Elastohydrodynamic lubrication analysis of a functionally graded layered bearing surface, with particular reference to 'cushion form bearings' for artificial knee joints	Elastohydrodynamic lubrication of a functionally graded layered (FGL) bearing surface, whose elastic modulus increases with depth from the bearing surface, was investigated in this study. The finite difference method was employed to solve the Reynolds equation, simultaneously with the elasticity equation of the bearing surface, under circular point contacts. The finite element method was adopted to solve the elasticity equation for the FGL bearing surface. The displacement coefficients thus obtained were used to calculate the elastic deformation of the bearing surface, required for the elastohydrodynamic lubrication analysis. Good agreement of the predicted film thickness and pressure distribution was obtained, between the present method and a previous study for a single layered bearing surface with a uniform elastic modulus. The general numerical methodology was then applied to an FGL bearing surface with both linear and exponential variations in elastic modulus, with particular reference to the 'cushion form bearing' for artificial knee joints. The predicted film thickness and pressure distribution were shown to be quite close to those obtained for a single layer under typical operating conditions representative of artificial knee joints, provided that the elastic modulus of the single layer was chosen to be the average elastic modulus of the graded layer.

84867186723	Williams element for mode-III stress intensity factor	Based on the fact that the anti-plane crack is one of the basic and crucial fracture type for engineering structures, and there are some limitations for traditional finite element in determination of mode-III stress intensity factor (SIF). Williams series for global displacement fields in singular region near the tip of mode-III crack were presented. The local displacement field of subelement were approximated by means of the shaped function of conventional finite element method. According to the principle that the global field determines the local one, the Williams element was presented for singular region near the crack tip, so that the mode-III SIF could be directly determined by the coefficients of the Williams element. Three important parameters, i.e the radial scale factor, the number of subelement and the series term, were discussed for Williams element. The influence of the relative length of crack on the SIF was investigated. The results show that the Williams element can achieve high accuracy and efficiency in evaluation of SIF.

Three textures with crater shape, sombrero shape and W-type donut shape were obtained by different parameter combinations. The effects of type, pressure and angle of aid gas and laser pulse frequency on the textured topography dimensions of the sombrero shape were discussed. The microstructure and the hardness of crater shape textured topography were also investigated. The results show that the shape and the dimension of textured topography can be controlled by laser parameters and supplementary process parameters. Oxygen is not favorable for the formation of sombrero shape topography, while nitrogen is not favorable for the formation of crater shape topography. The microstructure of the textured points is acicular martensite. Compared with matrix material, the hardness of textured points has been increased 3 times.

The stiffness equation was developed for Williams element with GDOFs to yield directly the SIF at the reflective crack tip in the asphalt pavement, as the Williams element contains parameters related to the SIF.

Results from the Williams element agree well with those by the traditional quarter-point element, therefore Williams element can be used for SIF evaluation at the reflective crack tip in the asphalt pavement on the semi-rigid base course.

0345356206	An experimental study on oil-film dynamic coefficients	The oil-film force of hydrodynamic bearing is often characterized by a set of linear stiffness and damping coefficients. This paper presents an experimental method to recognize these coefficients and establishes their characteristics under varieties of operating conditions. The fundamental test model is obtained from a Taylor series expansion of bearing reaction force. A delicate test rig is constructed and experimental data are acquired under various testing conditions. The coefficients are evaluated by means of least mean square in time domain. The experiments indicate that the linear oil-film dynamic coefficients are sensitive to the excitation force. The sensitivity is varied for the different coefficients. From the investigation, it can be seen that the linear model is invalid under condition of high excitation force. That is to say, the nonlinear components, which are ignored in traditional linear model, should be considered in those conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84890814641	Load distribution model of deep groove ball bearing with ball off size	A load distribution model in consideration of ball off size for deep groove ball bearing is put forward. For single off-sized ball, effects of magnitude of off size and external load are analyzed. For multiple off-sized balls, both effects of number and arrangement of off-sized balls on bearing load distribution are studied. For single off-sized ball, the results indicate that ball contact load fluctuation is linearly dependent on the value of off size, and has a non-linear relationship with external load. In addition, the variation of ball contact load is a function of its circumferential position. For multiple off-sized balls, both relative off size value and relative position of off-sized balls have significant effects on load distribution. © 2013 IEEE.

84893871095	Stress intensity factor for mixed mode cracks by Williams element	An element discretizing the singular region around the crack tip for stress intensity factor of mixed mode cracks is developed, the improved Williams series is applied to define the global displacement field of element in singular region around crack tip, while the local displacement field of subelement is approximated by employing the shape function of common finite element method. The global displacement field governs nodal displacement of subelement, so that the stiffness equation of Williams element for mixed mode is developed by using the theorem for summation of the finite geometric proportion series. The stress intensity factor can be evaluated analytically for mixed mode cracks by the corresponding undetermined constant in the model of Williams element, which overcomes the disadvantage of the singular element in determination of the stress intensity factor via extrapolation and regression analysis of intermediate physical quantity. Examples are considered to demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of proposed Williams element. The parametric study is implemented to illustrate the stress intensity factor versus the length and inclination angle of the crack, and determine the values of three important parameters for the Williams element, including the radial scale factor, the number of subelement and the series term.

84897143506	Surface texture influence on rotor-bearing system stability	Aiming at engineering application of surface texture in high speed and high precision machine tool bearings, an effective and simple process was conducted to make texture on the journal surface. The surface texture influence on rotor-journal bearing system stability was experimentally investigated. The rotor was excited by the unbalance mass, and the vibration displacements of journals with and without texture were measured and compared under supplied pressures of 0.16 MPa and 0.30 MPa, and at rotating speeds of 2400 r/min, 4200 r/min and 6000 r/min. The experiments reveal that the surface texture slightly affects vibration amplitude in the case of lower supplied pressure and rotating speed, but the surface texture is able to reduce vibration significantly at certain rotating speeds. The supply pressure becomes important for the bearing stability, and the vibration amplitude under higher supplied pressure gets greater than that under lower supplied pressure. However, surface texture restrains rotor-bearing system vibration effectively even if oil whirl arises, and the relative vibration amplitude reduces by 60% in the rotor with surface texture.

84920380225	Theoretical and experimental study on the dynamic characteristics of tilting pad thrust bearing considering excitation frequency	A modeling and testing method of dynamic characteristics considering excitation frequency of tilting pad trust bearing are proposed to study the effect of the excitation frequency on its dynamic characteristics. The excitation frequency is introduced into calculation process of dynamic coefficients of tilting pad thrust bearing according to the definition of stiffness and damping of tilting pad bearings. The mathematical model of its dynamic characteristics containing excitation frequency is deduced through establishing fluid film thickness equation, Reynolds equation and equation of tile motion under the condition of axial disturbance. The variation of stiffness and damping with perturbation frequency, that is, the ratio of excitation frequency to spindle rotation frequency, speed and load are analyzed. Test results of stiffness and damping in different excitation frequency, rotation speeds and loads are obtained in the test rig of tilting pad trust bearing by using impulse excitation method. The following conclusions are obtained through analyzing the theoretical and test results. When the perturbation frequency is small, the stiffness of tilting pad thrust bearing increases gradually with its enlargement, the damping is just the opposite. While the stiffness and damping tend to be stable gradually after perturbation frequency increases to a certain degree. In addition, the amplitude of variation of stiffness and damping with perturbation frequency is little affected by speed and load.
