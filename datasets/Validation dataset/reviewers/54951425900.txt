77954475473	Design and preliminary evaluation of an air-alternating wheelchair seating system for pressure ulcer prevention	Despite the diversity of wheelchair cushions currently used and reported, pressure on bony prominences continues to be a major problem for wheelchair-bound patients, and the incidence of pressure ulcers remains high. This paper introduces a novel air-alternating wheelchair seating (AWS) system for pressure ulcer prevention. The AWS system is composed of 9 separate air chambers, an air pressure sensor MPX2202 and other peripheral control parts. Each air chamber is designed in different size and shape according to the main weight-supporting sites of human buttock and can be inflated and deflated through respective electromagnetic valve under the control of MCU PIC16F877. The AWS system can operate in three basic mode: 1) automatic adjusting mode, 2) manual adjusting mode and 3) air fluid-filled mode and has the potential to improve the prevention of pressure ulcer by alternating supporting site of human buttock either automatically or manually by keyboard manipulating. The preliminary evaluation results of interface pressure measurement showed an obvious pressure relieving characteristic.

In order to improve the accuracy of a portable bioimpedance spectrometer (BIS) by correcting the systematic errors mathematically, a low cost and accurate three-reference calibration (TRC) algorithm based on quadratic Lagrange interpolation is applied. The principle of the TRC algorithm and the selection of the three RC calibration references are expounded and experimental measurements on a RC measurand are carried out to evaluate the performance of the TRC algorithm.

84861764934	3D numerical simulation of air sparging remediation process	Air sparging (AS) is an important in situ remedial technology which was widely used in groundwater remediation for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, lack of standards, the field design of air sparging system was mainly based on experience. In order to further explore the process of contaminant removal by AS and provide principles for field design, numerical simulation of air sparging process was conducted. In the process of water-air two phase flow, Darcy's law and mass conservation law were employed to get the control equations of water and air transport. The relationship between permeability-saturation-suction (K-S-P) was described by the Van Genuchten (VG) model and Mualem formula. Based on the water-air two phase flow, numerical simulation of contaminant removal was performed regarding the solute transport, inter-phase mass transfer and biodegradation model. 3D FEM model was developed to simulate the air sparging process and compared with the 2D simulation results. As shown in the simulation results, the zone of influence (ZOI) calculated by the 3D model is much smaller, and the lowest water saturation occurs near the sparging point while above the point the water saturation goes higher then lower. Either considering buoyant force or neglecting the air compressibility makes the ZOI smaller. The contaminant removal zone fits well with sparging influence zone. Within the ZOI, solute transfer enhances removal process while biodegradation which is the main removal factor outside the ZOI makes the removal process slow. The results suggest a better remediation effect is achieved when the contaminant zone is covered by the air sparging ZOI. It is shown that two phase flow model combined with contaminant removal could be applied to well simulate the whole process of air sparging, instructive and meaningful to the in-situ air sparging design, application and effectiveness evaluation.

67649660557	Efficient power network analysis with complete inductive modeling	In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to accurately analyze large-scale power/ground (P/G) networks, where inductive parasitics are modeled with the partial reluctance. The method is based on frequency-domain circuit analysis and the technique of vector fitting [8], and obtains the time-domain voltage response at given P/G nodes. The frequency-domain circuit equation including partial reluctances is derived, and then solved with the GMRES algorithm with rescaling and precondition techniques. Due to the sparsified reluctance matrix and the frequency-domain based simulation techniques, the proposed method is able to handle large-scale P/G networks with complete inductive modeling. Numerical results show that the proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than HSPICE, and capable of handling the inductive P/G structures with more than 100,000 wire segments. © 2009 IEEE.

The purpose of the research is to experimentally develop shear capacity of the joints in NTR structure, focusing on the shear capacity, failure modes and mechanism of the joints, and also on development of the bearing capacity and deformation ability by changing the shape of the joint. Behaviors and modality of two specimens were experimentally researched under static loading tests. In the tests, influencing factors such as the migration rate of cross-section, which influenced the strength and deformation properties of the joints, were experimentally examined. As the stress state of joint core concrete is different, the ultimate bearing capacity of joint which the migration rate of cross-section is 0 is 1286 kN but the other is 1138 kN which the migration rate of cross-section is 0.5. The experimental phenomenon and data analysis showed that both bearing capacity and deformation ductility of the joints were effectively increased by changing the migration rate of cross-section. The mechanism of the joints with typical shear failure was experimentally clarified and the main conclusions are that the migration rate of cross-section was one of the key factors influencing the stiffness and deformation capacity after failure, and the strength and quantity of the stirrup was also mainly influencing fact to the bearing capacity of the joint.

84863293086	Application of porous nickel-coated TiO 2 for the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous quinoline in an internal airlift loop reactor	P25 film, prepared by a facile dip-coating method without any binder, was further developed in a recirculating reactor for quinoline removal from synthetic wastewater. Macroporous foam Ni, which has an open three-dimensional network structure, was utilized as a substrate to make good use of UV rays. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the coated/calcinated P25 films consisted of two crystal phases, and had a number of uniform microcracks on the surface. The effects of initial quinoline concentration, light intensity, reaction temperature, aeration, and initial pH were studied. Increased reaction time, light intensity, environmental temperature, and gas aeration were found to significantly improve the quinoline removal efficiency. The aeration effect of oxygen dependency on the quinoline degradation had the trend pure oxygen > air > no gas > pure nitrogen with free O

84863604865	Pronunciation scoring model for Mandarin Phonemes based on feature comparison using a simulated annealing genetic algorithm	A Mandarin Phoneme pronunciation scoring model was developed to help people with difficulty in pronunciation and people learning foreign languages to rectify pronunciation errors. The method uses feature comparison of the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) and a simulated annealing genetic algorithm (SAGA). The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is used to evaluate the phoneme similarity, and to automatically compute the scores for these phonemes based on the SAGA scoring mechanism. This paper compares phoneme scores using different optimization algorithms (SAGA and local optimization) and different DTW algorithms. The results show that the SAGA model accuracy is better than 94%, significantly better than the local-optimization model. Moreover, the combination of SAGA and the improved DTW algorithm with a parallelogram search path resulted in the best pronunciation score. Thus, the model based on the MFCC and SAGA methods is appropriate for pronunciation scoring of Mandarin Phonemes.

84863679221	Pitch perception of concurrent harmonic tones with overlapping spectra	Fundamental frequency difference limens (F0DLs) were measured for a target harmonic complex tone with nominal fundamental frequency (F0) of 200 Hz, in the presence and absence of a harmonic masker with overlapping spectrum. The F0 of the masker was 0, ±3, or ±6 semitones relative to 200 Hz. The stimuli were bandpass filtered into three regions: 0-1000 Hz (low, L), 1600-2400 Hz (medium, M), and 2800-3600 Hz (high, H), and a background noise was used to mask combination tones and to limit the audibility of components falling on the filter skirts. The components of the target or masker started either in cosine or random phase. Generally, the effect of F0 difference between target and masker was small. For the target alone, F0DLs were larger for random than cosine phase for region H. For the target plus masker, F0DLs were larger when the target had random phase than cosine phase for regions M and H. F0DLs increased with increasing center frequency of the bandpass filter. Modeling using excitation patterns and summary autocorrelation and stabilized auditory image models suggested that use of temporal fine structure information can account for the small F0DLs obtained when harmonics are barely, if at all, resolved. © 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

84864282922	Feasibility study on online DSA through distributed time domain simulations in WAN	As power systems become more closely interconnected and are deregulated, multi-area united online dynamic security assessment (DSA) is highly demanded. In this paper, a distributed framework for carrying out multi-area united online DSA over a wide area network (WAN) is proposed. In this framework, different control centers take part in the computation in a distributed processing manner with only boundary conditions being exchanged. To make the distributed DSA feasible for online use, a high performance distributed transient simulation algorithm is presented. Moreover, the overall time cost of the multi-case distributed simulations is modeled by analogizing the influence of different computation and communication resources. Based on the theoretic model obtained, the optimal task scheduling strategy is studied for scanning multiple contingencies. A distributed simulation platform which can emulate the WAN communication environment is built up, and the standard IEEE 39-bus system and a real Chinese power system with 5422 buses are used as test systems. Results demonstrate that with current computing and communication techniques, distributed DSA can fully satisfy the requirements of online use. © 2012 IEEE.

84864297605	Improved Fake-State Attack to the Quantum Key Distribution Systems	It has been showed that most commercial quantum cryptosystems are vulnerable to the fake-state attacks, which employ the loophole that the avalanche photodiodes as single photon detectors still produce detection events in the linear mode. However, previous fake-state attacks may be easily prevented by either installing a watch dog or reconfiguring the dead-time assigning component. In this paper, we present a new technique to counteract the after-pulse effect ever enhanced by the fake-state attacks, in order to lower the quantum bit error rate. Obviously, it is more difficult to detect the presented attack scheme. Indeed, it contributes to promoting of implementing a secure quantum cryptosystem in real life. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Target tone was presented in the absence or presence of a masker tone, which was filtered into the same frequency region with the target. The target and masker had different phase combinations and fundamental frequency differences. Results found that there were no significant effects of phase combination, but frequency region and fundamental frequency difference played significant roles in pitch perception. Analysis based on temporal model found that medium-rank harmonic complex tones could obtain good results of pitch perception, which is probably based on the use of temporal fine structure information. This study could help build mechanism of pitch perception under complicated sound scene.

84866004751	A novel five-category loan-risk evaluation model using multiclass LS-SVM by PSO	Five-category loan classification (FCLC) is an international financial regulation approach. Recently, the application and implementation of FCLC in the Chinese microfinance bank has mostly relied on subjective judgment, and it is difficult to control and lower loan risk. In view of this, this paper is dedicated to researching and solving this problem by constructing the FCLC model based on improved particle-swarm optimization (PSO) and the multiclass, least-square, support-vector machine (LS-SVM). First, LS-SVM is the extension of SVM, which is proposed to achieve multiclass classification. Then, improved PSO is employed to determine the parameters of multiclass LS-SVM for improving classification accuracy. Finally, some experiments are carried out based on rural credit cooperative data to demonstrate the performance of our proposed model. The results show that the proposed model makes a distinct improvement in the accuracy rate compared with one-vs.-one (1-v-1) LS-SVM, one-vs.-rest (1-v-r) LS-SVM, 1-v-1 SVM, and 1-v-r SVM. In addition, it is an effective tool in solving the problem of loan-risk rating. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84868448459	Spatial variations of hydrocarbon contamination and soil properties in oil exploring fields across China	Successful site remediation is critically based on a comprehensive understanding of distribution of contaminants, soil physico-chemical and microbial properties in oil contaminated sites. One hundred and ten topsoils were sampled from seven typical oil fields in different geoclimate regions across north to south China to investigate the spatial variances of oil contaminations and soil parameters. Oil concentrations and compositions, soil geochemical properties and microbial populations were analyzed and statistic analysis methods were used to analyze the spatial pattern of soil variables. The results indicated that oil contaminations were serious in most oil exploring areas in China, especially with high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from petrogenic origin. Ordination analyses indicated a relatively distinct spatial pattern that all soil samples grouped mainly by geographic locations, instead of distributing along contamination or other geochemical variable gradient. Microbial populations were found to be statistically positively correlated with soil nitrogen, phosphorus and water content, and negatively correlated with salt pH and soluble salts (P<0.05). This study provided insights into the spatial variability of soil variables in hydrocarbon-contaminated fields across large spatial scales, which is important for the environmental protection and further remediation in oil contaminated sites according to local conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

During the 80-day experiment, 31. 6% of oil was removed from the adjacent rhizosphere (AR); this value was 27% and 53%higher than the percentage of oil removed from the far rhizosphere (FR) and from the non-rhizosphere (NR), respectively. The populations of heterotrophic bacteria and hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were higher in the AR and FR than in the NR. However, the removal rate of crude oil was positively correlated with the proportion of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the rhizosphere. In total, 796, 731, and 379 functional genes were detected by microarray in the AR, FR, and NR, respectively. Higher proportions of functional genes related to carbon degradation and organic remediation, were found in rhizosphere soil compared with NR soil, suggesting that the rhizosphere selectively increased the abundance of these specific functional genes. The increase in water-holding capacity and decrease in pH as well as salinity of the soil all followed the order of AR>FR>NR. Canonical component analysis showed that salinity was the most important environmental factor influencing the microbial functional structure in the rhizosphere and that salinity was negatively correlated with the abundance of carbon and organic degradation genes. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

For large dataset, the computational demands for classifying patterns using KNN can be expensive. A way to solve this problem is through the condensing approach. It means we remove instances that will bring computational burden but do not contribute to better classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new condensing algorithm based on centre vector. The proposed idea is to extract some representative samples and take the processed result as a new training sample set. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy can dramatically shorten the time consumption compared with the traditional KNN. On average, the speedup ratios improve 90% while classification accuracy only has 6% decrease. ©2012 by Binary Information Press.

84871548895	An early smoke detection system based on increment of optical flow residual	It has long been a big challenge to extract dense smoke regions by motion detection. As a result, there are too few suspected smoke regions being recognized for an early fire alarm. In this paper, an early smoke detecting system that can efficiently extract dense smoke regions is proposed. Firstly, since the brightness in the areas that have dynamic texture is not constant, the residuals of optical flow are calculated to locate suspected smoke regions. A certain threshold of the increment of optical flow residuals is also used to distinguish smoke from other dynamic texture. Secondly, five features that can jointly represent a smoke area, including grayish color, chrominance decrease, edge energy decrease, optical flow orientation diffusion and circularity, are chosen by thorough experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed system can detect the smoke in early time and is robust to most kinds of interferences, especially other dynamic textures. © 2012 IEEE.

A channel selection scheme is proposed under the condition that the priori information of primary user is known. Based on the idle and busy state statistical properties of the primary user signal, secondary user performs sensing on the objective licensed channel in accordance with the vacancy state probability in descending order, and then accesses to the first channel detected to be idle. For the fixed rate and variable rate services, the performances of packet loss rate and throughput of cognitive radio network are analyzed. As for the channel selection scheme in the case of the unknown priori information to the secondary user, the system performances are influenced by the mean probability of error prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic spectrum access scheme based on learning and prediction achieves better performances in packet loss rate and throughput than the random spectrum sensing. Learning-based channel selection of dynamic spectrum access can exploit spectrum holes efficiently and improve the channel utilization in cognitive radio systems.

However, the bow-tie antenna, which is widely used in impulse GPR, has very low radiating efficiency because remarkable energy fed into antenna is radiated as the form of end reflection. In this paper, we study how to design bow-tie antenna with high radiating efficiency for impulse GPR. We find that, if the bow-tie antenna is excited by a bipolar pulse, the radiation efficiency can be significantly improved by utilizing the energy in end reflections.

Target tone was presented alone, or mixed with the masker, which were filtered into the same bandpass frequency region (low, medium, or high) to obtain different resolvability. There were five kinds of fundamental frequency difference and four kinds of phase combination between target and masker. Five young subjects participated in experiments, all of whom had normal hearing (thresholds ≤15 dB HL). Results found fundamental frequency difference limens were increased with up-shift frequency region of the harmonics. The fundamental frequency difference between target and masker had a significant impact on the performance, while phase effects were small. Analysis suggested that the resolvability of harmonics had a significant impact on the fundamental frequency difference limens, but pitch perception of medium-rank harmonics was not based on the resolvability. Analysis also suggested that most results of pitch perception of target-masker mixture were closely correlated with peaks on the excitation patterns.

A finite periodic grating is in consideration. Using finite FEM/BEM tool, the field (mechanical displacements and electric potential) distributions could be calculated at every frequency. Then the field contributed by SAW should be separated from the total field by Source Regeneration Method.

In particular, the dispersive reflection coefficient and propagation velocity are obtained independently. As an example, a synchronous one-port resonator is simulated using dispersive COM parameters extracted by the method mentioned in this paper. The electrical property of the resonator agrees well with the result simulated by finite FEM/BEM, which verifies this approach is accurate and effective. © 2012 IEEE.

We study DES block cipher working in cipher feedback mode (CFB) as a special case. In our model, eavesdropper launches linear attack by querying an oracle which provides her with corrupted ciphertexts over a binary symmetric channel (BSC). A new verification strategy in linear attack has been designed and numerically optimized to allow Eve to mount a successful attack in noisy environments. However, we show that even by utilizing this optimized strategy, there is still possibility of misdetection in Eve's cryptanalysis, which directly depends on the channel degradation level. Numerical results show that the proposed attack strategy lets Eve maintain a high performance even for relatively high noise levels. On the other hand, they suggest that due to Eve's possible failures in her attack, tunable cross over probability of the channel can bring about the lowest performance for Eve as well as a higher security. © 2012 IEEE.

84877684840	Using end reflections to improve the pulse radiation efficiency of bow-tie Antenna	Bow-tie antenna is widely used for pulse radiation, but the radiation efficiency is less than 30%. In this letter, a novel method is presented to improve the efficiency by exploiting the energy in end reflections, which are thought to be harmful and usually suppressed in the reported literatures. When the exciting pulse is bipolar and mono-cycle, it is indicated that, the end reflection can be used for producing a pulse with increased peak value by optimizing the antenna length. The simulation results show that the pulse radiation efficiency can be increased 100% with the presented method. © IEICE 2013.

84878604319	Cryptanalysis of the secure quantum private comparison protocol	Recently, Yang et al [2009 Phys. Scr. 80 065002] presented the first quantum private comparison protocol that involves single photons only. This protocol is very promising in practice. However, in this paper, we analyze the security of the protocol and point out a subtle loophole. It is shown that both Eve and Charlie could obtain Bob's secret by launching a special dense-coding attack. Moreover, details of this attack and its correctness are given, and also two solutions are demonstrated to improve the protocol in order to overcome the fatal flaw. © 2013 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

84878919501	Fast detection of ground penetrating radar objects based on cross correlation and hough transform	Considering the issue of low computation efficiency of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) object detection method, a fast algorithm is proposed based on the spatial distribution of reflected energy, which is modeled as a three-parameter hyperbola. A reflection hyperbola is first extracted by utilizing the correlation between adjacent reflections. Being weighted with reflection energy, the hyperbola is then fitted to estimate the two parameters of the reflected model. Finally, the object detection and localization task is completed with one dimensional Hough transform. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. Compared with the traditional algorithm based on Hough transform, the proposed algorithm consumes only 1.5% computational time without sacrificing the detection and localization performance.

84880002001	Weight analysis of objective evaluation parameters for a diesel engine noise quality with support vector machine	A six-cylinder diesel engine was taken as an object. The classified-paired comparison method was used to perform subjective evaluation test for the diesel engine radiated noise in cases of multi-load. Meanwhile, five objective evaluation parameters describing the objective characteristics of the diesel engine noise were chosen and calculated. A support vector machine was adopted to establish a diesel engine noise quality prediction model, and the accuracy of the prediction model was verified with the noise measuring samples. Based on the prediction model, the influence weight of the objective evaluation parameters of the noise quality on the results of subjective evaluation was calculated and analyzed. The results showed that the loudness and roughness were the main objective parameters affecting the diesel engine noise quality. This analysis provided a guidance for design of a diesel engine with higher noise quality.

By use of the comparable full scale model test method, two confined concrete columns with horizontal strengthened bars spliced by grout sleeves and two cast-in site column with plain stirrups were designed and constructed. Through reversed low cyclic loading test, compared with the cast-in site column with plain stirrups, the bearing capacity and the seismic performance of the confined concrete column with horizontal bar was studied. The test results indicated: This connection type is reliable. And under the same condition, the bearing capacity and the seismic behavior of the confined concrete column with horizontal strengthened bars spliced by grout sleeves are equal to the cast-in-site column with plain stirrups.

84881592932	Improve the radiation efficiency of bow-tie antenna by exploiting the energy in end reflections	The bow-tie antenna, which is widely used in impulse ground penetrating radar (GPR), has very low radiating efficiency. It is because that nearly 70% of the radiated energy exists as the form of end reflection, which is obstructive to probing objects. In order to keep the probing ability, the remarkable energy in end reflections is usually dissipated by resistive loading. Through the current research, it was found that, if the exciting pulse is bipolar and monocycle, the radiation efficiency can be significantly improved by utilizing the energy in end reflection, and the improvement can be implemented by optimizing the antenna length. The simulated results show that the radiation efficiency can be increased by nearly 100%. The measured results validate the proposed method again. Additionally, the proposed method is easy to be carried out in applications and of great use.
