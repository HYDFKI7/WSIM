15944383466	Dynamic monitoring and fem simulation analysis of an expressway tunnel with unsymmetrical loadings	FEM calculation results and the time series of in-situ measures for the entrance of Longjin tunnel on the Chong-Zun expressway are presented. A FEM model is established to simulate the deformation behaviors of the tunnel. The anchors are simulated with the anchorage elements, while the cement lining and the steel-arc shelf are simulated with the straight beam elements. The results show that the deformation behavior of the surrounding rock mass is controlled by unsymmetrical loadings during the process of construction. It is proposed that not only the in-situ dynamic measurements but also the analysis of FEM be important for successful construction of the tunnel.

The case study shows that the predicted displacements by the method agree well with the measured values, so the proposed method can be adopted in practice.

16644388919	Statistical damage constitutive model for rock and back analysis of its parameters	Based on random distribution of interior defect in rock, a statistical damage constitutive model for rock is developed by using the continuous strength theory and statistical theory. Failure criterion of rock, as the distribution variable of the micro-unit strength in the constitutive model, greatly affects stress-strain curve and the equivalent elastic modulus of rock, and it must be chosen carefully for specific rock. By using back analysis method, the statistical distribution parameters in the constitutive model are solved. The proposed model can consider the effect of stress states and reflect the behavior in which the complete stress-strain curve of rock varies with stress-strain state. Comparison of the proposed model and experimental results shows that the proposed model is verified and can be applied in practical engineering.

29244447193	Global safety factor of compound soil-nailed wall determined by strength reduction method	The strength reduction method and explicit finite difference method are used to calculate the global safety factor of the compound soil-nailed wall (CSNW). Compared with the traditional slice method, such as simplified Bishop's method, Janbu's method, Spencer's method and Morgenstern-Price's method, the strength reduction method reduces a lot of assumptions, such as the shape of the failure surface and the location of the failure band. Thus, the strength reduction method makes the concept of safety factor more clear and the failure surface more intuitive. In the calculation, only the strength of the soil and the cement deep mixing pile are reduced during the process. The strength parameters of the nail bar and that of the interface between the grouting body and the soil are regarded as constant. A compound soil-nailed wall project of typical soft clay of Shanghai is presented. The contour map of shear strain increment is recommended to recognize the failure surface or failure band of the CSNW. The failure surface calculated with strength reduction method is identical to the actual failure pattern of the CSNW. The traditional slice methods based on the limit equilibrium theory are also used to calculate the global safety factor. The result of strength reduction method and that of the traditional computing technology are compared and the difference between them is smaller than 10%. The tiny discrepancy of the safety factors calculated by the different methods mentioned above is acceptable. So it is concluded that the strength reduction method can be used in practice.

Some of them are very significant for the recent engineering practices. This paper mainly presents the research works carried out on two issues, i.e., (1) stability analysis of the surrounding rock of large span underground structures built in complex geological condition, (2) deformation behavior and support mechanism of deep-buried long and large rock tunnel.

33845349827	Deformation of huge underground opening excavated in layered rock mass with steep dip angle	Considering the special characteristics of steep inclined layered rock, this paper introduced Cosserat continuum theory to simulate excavating huge underground openings in layered rock mass. A program based on this theory was written in Matlab, in which the couple stress is taken into account. The modeling of a simple underground opening excavated in layered rock mass was carried out. The results show that with the decreasing of space between layers, the deformation of surrounding rock increases and tends to more unsymmetrical; with the increasing of dip angle, the deformation increases first but then decreases, and when the dip angel is 60°, the deformation of anti-inclined wall come to a head, whereas the maximum deformation of the other side wall is got when the dip angel is 30°. At the same height of the opening, the deformation of inclined wall is larger than that of anti-inclined wall when the dip angle is gently, whereas the deformation of anti-inclined wall is smaller than that of inclined wall when the dip angel is steep. The deformation is effected by the shear stiffness greatly, but when it reduces to certain degree, the deformation will be stable. The numerical modeling indicates the Cosserat continuum theory is suitable for simulating excavating underground opening in layered rock mass, and it is simple and convenient.

The anisotropic effect is controlled by the lithologic characteristics, and apparent for slate and phyllite, while not for the other two kinds of rocks, mylonite and metasandstone. The wave velocity ratio vertical to the stratum of the rock samples is usually less than that in parallel direction, and the relative increment of wave velocity ratio between the vertical direction and the parallel direction decreases as the wave velocity ratio in vertical direction gradually increases. By treating the rock as the transverse isotropic elastic medium and using numerical test of the wave velocity function, the property is theoretically validated.

Test results show that size distribution of rock fragments between 0.5-20.0 mm in Brazilian Split test is a fractal structure with an average fractal dimension value of 1.9761. A dual self-similar characteristic is revealed in uniaxial compressive test, that is, the size distribution of rock fragments during the two ranges of 0.1-1.0 mm and 2.0-40.0 mm is also a fractal structure, the two corresponding average fractal dimension values are 2.1350 and 1.5499. And the fractal dimension values rise with the increase of uniaxial compressive strengths but are not closely related to the tensile strength due to the marbles' anisotropy. The fractal dimension value of sample fragments is also the appropriate indication of the loading form, by introducing the equivalent probability formula, a satisfying analysis is given.

One is the conformity of the anisotropy of P wave and S wave velocity expressed by that the anisotropic indexes of S wave velocity would linearly increase as the P wave anisotropic indexes increase in a great degree, namely the anisotropy of S wave velocity is statistically proportional to that of P wave; the other effect is the variation between P wave and S wave velocity anisotropy, which is mainly expressed by that the anisotropic index of the P wave velocity is usually greater than S wave in the parallel and vertical directions to the stratum of the rock samples which means that the anisotropy of S wave velocity is inferior to that of P wave. Using numerical value test based on the wave velocity function of the transverse isotropic elastic medium, the two effects are validated.

The permeability coefficients of clayey siltstone and brown mudstone were investigated by the transient pulse technique in the complete stress-strain curve. The results show that: (1) The permeability coefficient of clayey siltstone decreases in the stage of elastic deformation but increases in the stage of plastic deformation and the fractured phases. The permeability coefficient on the direction vertical to the bedding plane is larger than that on the direction parallel to the bedding plane. (2) The permeability of brown mudstone decreases in the stage of plastic deformation but keeps stable in the stage of creep deformation. The permeability coefficient on the direction vertical to the bedding plane is similar to that on the direction parallel to the bedding plane. Combined with the stress-train curves, it can be deduced that in the stage of elastic deformation, the permeability coefficient of clay siltstone is mainly influenced by porosity and small cracks; and in the stage of plastic deformation and the fractured phases, it is mainly influenced by small crack. In the complete deformation process, the permeability coefficient of brown mudstone is influenced by porosity and small cracks, boty effects are not distinguishable.

Starting from the homogenization theory of heterogeneous materials and statistics method, a parameter D to describe the disturbance degree is proposed, and a formula to determine the parameter has been derived by using the plastic displacement of a pile as distribution variable. In the model, shear intensity of elements in an intact state are simulated by Duncan-Zhang model and that in a critical state by Mohr-Coulomb criterion. The model of this paper has few parameters, which can reflect the aspects of load transfer function, such as hardening, softening and the effects of confining pressure. The well agreement between the in-situ data and the predicted shows that the validity of the model herein. So the proposed model in this paper is easy to be used in engineering practice. © 2007 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.

36549025494	Analysis and prediction of effect of controlling ground settlement at Xiamen subsea tunnel	Xiamen Xiang'an subsea tunnel is the first subsea tunnel in China. The ground settlement became large when the CRD method was adopted on the right line in Wutong side. So it is determined to change the excavation method, i.e. the both-side drift method. Combined with the construction site and ground settlement, the CRD method is then adopted. The main purpose is to find the possible reasons that cause the large settlement. First, it is focused on the influence of the excavation, and it is seen that the displacement of the tunnel is the main reason that causes the ground settlement. Second, the decreases of the cohesion and friction of soils that are caused by continuous rainfall are contributed to the large settlement. Third, the ground surface of soils is changed into artificial landfill compared with the completed parts. At the same time, the controlling effects of ground settlement when the excavation way is changed to adopt the both-side drift method are obvious. The development of ground settlement with this method is different from that with CRD method, though the maximal settlement is all located at the top of the subsea tunnel. Finally, the difference between the two methods on the controlling effects of ground settlement and the regularity of the surface deformation are summarized. It can provide references to the construction of the project, and it can be adopted for similar projects.

35948957476	Study on marble unloading mechanical properties of Jinping hydropower station under high geostress conditions	The Jinping Hydropower Station is a large-scale national key project, of which the diversion tunnels are deep-buried. Especially the tunnels are located in a high geostress area; so it is of significance to study the variation laws of unloading mechanical properties under high geostress conditions. To simulate the tunnel excavation unloading effect, a series of triaxial unloading tests and a special designed multiple failure state unloading tests are carried out. The results show that under high geostress conditions, the unloading properties of marble specimens are as follows. (1) Under same initial stress conditions, stress needed in axial compression failure is more than that in confined unloading failure. Confining pressure reduction is prone to cause rock failure. (2) From the very beginning of unloading, the lateral deformation increases remarkably; and dilatancy presents prominently. Moreover, if the deformation caused by initial axial compression is disregarded, the volumetric deformation increasing is dominated by lateral deformation. (3) During the unloading stage, the relationship between Poisson's ratio rises up; and the confining pressure could be well described by biquadrate. The deformation modulus declines indistinctly at first, while as failure approaching, even little confining declination would cause large decreases. (4) Shear strength parameter c under unloading conditions is 14%lower than that under conventional compression conditions; while ψ is greater than that about 23%. These conclusions reveal the unloading properties of marble under high geostress conditions and offer important references for stability analysis of deep-buried tunnels.

34249845817	Design of a shaking table test box for a subway station structure in soft soil	A reasonable choice of structure of a model box is significant for a shaking table test to be successful in geotechnical engineering. A model box has been designed for the shaking table test of a subway station structure in the soft soil of Shanghai in the paper. The reasonable geometric similarity scale of the subway station structure has been determined by a 3-D dynamic analysis under the action of lateral equivalent static loading. The shape, size and structure of the model box are chosen by considering all the involved factors comprehensively. The shape of the box is similar to that of a typical station structure, and the ratio between the plane dimension of the model ground and that of the model structure is big enough to reduce the influence of boundary condition effectively. The structure is strong enough to avoid being demolished by shaking during a test. The contact conditions between the model soil and box are clear to help the data gained from the test well fit that from numerical analysis. The total weight of the model soil and box is less than the bearing capacity of the shaking table apparatus and there is no resonance between the model soil and box. The results show that the model box can be used to simulate the dynamic response of a subway station structure very well, so it provides a firm foundation for the success of the shaking table test of a subway station structure. © Higher Education Press 2007.

Based on the Levenberg-Marquit optimization method, a modified method has been put forward by employing a new step factor matrix, in order to calculate both of the parameters of rock mass modulus (E), the in situ stress (P) and the permeability coefficient (K) in the back analysis. Compared with traditional step factor in optimization algorithm, the new step factor matrix can change the step factors respectively according to the different sensitivities of parameters, with which a new algorithm is established on MATLAB platform.

55649119361	Experimental study on creep behaviors of greenschist specimen from Jinping II hydropower station under biaxial compression	The biaxial compression creep tests on greenschist specimens from auxiliary tunnel of Jinping II Hydropower Station were carried out. There were many kinds of loading paths and many different stress levels in the tests. The one-dimensional Burgers model was developed into biaxial compression state. And the creep parameters of greenschist under biaxial compression were determined by Burgers model. The results show that the loading path has important effect on the axial and lateral creep laws. If the axial and lateral loads are exerted simultaneously with fixed ratio, the axial and lateral strains will ascend with increasing axial and lateral stresses. But if the axial load is exerted gradually with fixed lateral stress, the lateral strain will descend with increasing axial stresses. The comparison between Burgers model and experimental curves shows that Burgers model is applicable for determining the viscoelastic rheological parameters of greenschist. These parameters are helpful for the design of deep cavern of Jinping II Hydropower Station.

A FEM program was developed in Matlab environment to study the chloride migration and rust of reinforced bars in cracked segment concrete. It was shown: Cracks would alter the chloride migration in segment concrete and it was not reasonable to calculate the migration of chloride near cracks by one-dimensional Fick law; the rust time of reinforced bars would be reduced with the increase of the crack depth in terms of nonlinearity, and the logistic function with 3 parameters could well express the relationship between the rust time and the integrity. A coupling model was proposed for the chloride migration in segment joint and segment concrete, and the corresponding numerical method was developed. It was shown that the joint leakage would speed up the chloride migration in segment concrete and then accelerated the rust of reinforcing bars.

Based on the test, authors developed a carbonation model with variable carbonation coefficient and conducted grey correlation analysis on the factors, such as stress level, water cement ratio and carbonation age. The result shows that tensile stress and compressive stress are able to accelerate or slow down the concrete carbonation respectively, and the larger the stress level is, the larger the change in carbonation speed is. Meanwhile, the carbonation speed will increase with increase of water cement ratio. In addition, carbonation coefficient is not constant but will vary with carbonation age. Carbonation age has the greatest influence on carbonation speed, and influence of stress level on it takes the second place, while water cement ratio has the least influence on it.

The calculation results show that the displacements of the surrounding rock of the crown and the side wall increase obviously when tunnel excavating toward the geological interface from hard rock to soft rock. On the contrary, the displacements of the surrounding rock of the crown and the side wall around and ahead the excavation face will decrease apparently when tunnel excavating toward the geological interface from soft rock to hard rock. When tunnel is excavating toward the geological interface of soft and hard rock, the radial displacement of the surrounding rock of the side wall increase with the increasing of the lateral stress, and the longitudinal displacements of the surrounding rock of the crown and the side wall will increase with the increasing of the longitudinal stress. The displacement of the surrounding rock of hoof-like tunnel is smaller than that of the rectangular tunnel, and the displacement of surrounding rock of circular tunnel is the smallest. The displacement of the surrounding rock will be larger when the geological interface is oblique than when is vertical.

The developed solution is compared with the elastic solution with and without the consideration of the seepage filed, and it is found considering stress redistribution is necessary. The stress redistribution will increase the circumferential stress and decrease the radial stress. If the seepage field is considered, the stress will be underestimated, and the radial stress will exceed the circumferential stress at some positions far from the tunnel center. When the inner head is small, considering the seepage field will underestimate the plastic radius, which decreases with the enlarging of inner head until the plastic zone disappears eventually.

With the developing of confined stress, the chalk presents an evident pressure-sensitive effect that both the void ratio and oil permeability decreas. The oil permeability drops down with the increasing of hydraulic pressure, so that the water-flooding in oil reservoir raises the water content in chalk, which will make the matrix suction and oil permeability decrease consequently.

68049088736	Research on anisotropic characteristics and size effect of columnar jointed rock mass	The mechanical properties of columnar jointed rock mass, which is the main composition of dam foundation and surrounding rock of deep cavern at Baihetan hydropower station, are very complex. In order to study the anisotropic characteristics of columnar jointed rock mass, three factors are considered. First, a mixed multi-weakness planes softening constitutive model is built. It can be used to define and describe the mechanical properties and the softening characteristics of multiple oblique joint planes after failure. Second, considering the heterogeneity of the columnar jointed rock mass, a probability model is established through assigning mechanical parameters throughout the numerical specimens by following Weibull distribution. On the basis of sensitivity analysis of probability distribution parameters, combining with the experimental results of rigid bearing plate, the reasonable distribution parameters that fit the structure of field rock mass are computed. Third, column section of jointed rock mass is composed by tetrahedron, pentahedron and hexahedron randomly and irregularly. Voronoi algorithm is used to achieve the randomness of geometric shape and irregularity of arraying order. Taking all these factors into account, the bearing capacity and deformation characteristics in different directions are obtained. The results turn out to be obviously distinct in different directions. At the same time, multiple test blocks with different sizes are analyzed; and the curves of equivalent elastic modulus and unconfined compressive strength in different directions changing with size are acquired. It is shown that the columnar jointed rock mass has obvious size effect; meanwhile the characteristic scale is determined.

Vertical loadings were perpendicular or parallel to bedding planes, which were graded 4 classes. Lateral loadings in biaxial experiments were equal to half vertical loadings. The data of experiments were put forward by different strain-time curves, the relationship between both instantaneous elastic modulus and steady-state creep rate and stress level was established by employing exponential function. The results show that both bedding anisotropy and lateral pressure have strong control on the development of instantaneous strain and steady-state creep strain. In biaxial creep compression experiment, bedding anisotropy had greater effect on instantaneous elastic modulus and less effect on steady-state creep rate. But in uniaxial creep compression experiment, bedding anisotropy had greater effect both on instantaneous elastic modulus and steady-state creep rate. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

84884476580	Perfect elastic-brittle-plastic solution of axisymmetric circular openings in rock mass on extended SMP Criterion	Based on the extended Spatial Mobilization Plane Criterion (SMP), an elastic-brittle-plastic solution for an axisymmetric cylindrical tunnel was established, in which the influence of both intermediate principal compressive stress and material strain-softening behavior was considered, and the closed-form formulas of critical support force, the radius of a plastic zone, the distribution of stresses and displacements in surrounding rock were put forward. The elastic-plastic solution based on SMP was compared with Kastner solution, by which the rightness of the obtained elastic-plastic solution was verified. Also a comparative study between the elastic-brittle-plastic solution by obeying SMP and the current solution based on Mohr-Coulomb Criterion was made, including the examination of the influences of material strain-softening rate and intermediate principal stress. The results indicate that the rock strain-softening rate and the intermediate principal stress have a considerable effect on the stability analysis of surrounding rock, from which the strength potentials of rock mass can be used further, and it is also helpful for the design optimization of a tunnel support system.

84888242816	Biaxial compression creep test for greenschist considering influence of specimen width	The biaxial compression creep tests for greenschist were carried out. The creep test curves were fitted by six-component viscoelastic rheological model, and the influence of specimen width on creep deformation rule was studied. The results show that the axial and lateral strain will not always increase or decrease with increasing specimen width under the same stress level, but the axial creep strain rate of second creep stage will reduce all the time. The six-component viscoelastic rheological model curve and experimental curve approximately coincide with each other, which indicates that the rheological model is appropriate for determining the viscoelastic rheological parameters of greenschist.

84891653624	Biaxial compression creep test on green-schist considering the effects of water content and anisotropy	This study explores the effects of water content and anisotropy on the mechanical behavior of green-schist. The biaxial compression creep tests under dry and saturated conditions were first carried out. Then, the influences of geometric relationship between the loading orientation and the bedding plane, water content and volumetric content of marble interlayer were analyzed. The results indicate that both instantaneous and creep strains along two loading directions decrease with the increasing volumetric content of the marble interlayer. The influence of water content on the axial and the lateral instantaneous strains is different when the volumetric content of chlorite is different. For specimens of the same type at the same stress level, the axial strain with the both loading orientations parallel to the bedding plane is greater than that with the axial loading parallel to the bedding plane but the lateral loading perpendicular to the bedding plane. © 2014 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84897135854	Experimental investigations on structural anisotropy on creep of greenschist	In order to study the time-dependent deformation behavior of bedding anisotropy green schist of Jinping II hydropower station, this paper investigates the creep behavior of brittle bedding anisotropy rock by uniaxial compression creep experiments in laboratory. Six specimens were prepared with different inclination angles of bedding planes. Loading stress levels were graded 4 classes, and the maximum value of them were all approximately equal to the existing maximum initial geostress. All the strain-time curves of specimens did not exhibit the accelerated creep stage. The instantaneous elastic modulus and steady-state creep rate of specimens were obtained and analyzed based on the experiments data. The results show that the instantaneous elastic modulus of the specimens increases with the increment of stress level; and they were higher when the bedding planes are oblique to the compression direction; and the steady-state creep rate of the specimens increase with the increment of both stress level and the inclination angle of bedding planes; it reaches the maximum value with the inclination angle of the specimen close to the failure angle of rock.

84898937093	Simplified Seismic Design Method for Shanghai Underground Structures in Soft Soils	This paper presents a simplified seismic design method, the equivalent horizontal seismic inertial force method (EHSIFM), for underground structures in soft soils, especially for application in Shanghai subway structures. The EHSIFM utilizes the quasi-static approach. In this approach, the effects of equivalent horizontal seismic inertial forces, representing the dynamic forces induced by an earthquake, are imposed on the underground structures. Several parameters are derived through numerical correlation using values of embedded depth and soil types typical to Shanghai. The principle of equivalent limit state is adopted, in which the maximum internal force as well as its position on the underground structure under inertial forces, is identical to the real value. A sample design on a modeled double-story three-span subway station in soft soils is also conducted. Analytical results show that the EHSIFM is simple yet accurate enough to reflect structural seismic responses in an earthquake. © 2014 Indian Geotechnical Society.

84910008948	Prediction and control of ground deformation and displacement due to large slurry shield tunneling using stochastic medium theory	Slurry shield tunneling has been successfully applied worldwide in recent years due to its virtues. However, in complicated environment, the prediction and control of ground surface deformation and displacement due to large slurry shield excavation are the important problems to have to be solved. In this paper, the analytical formulation for ground surface deformation and displacement induced by tunnel excavation was presented on basis of stochastic medium model. An optimization theory of Powell's Conjugation method was employed in settlement back-analysis prediction for stochastic medium model. Combined with tunneling in buildings zone of Shanghai Yangtze river project, the cumulative ground surface deformation and displacement due to ultra-large slurry shield excavation in uplink and downlink was predicted respectively using the associated program and the suggestion on tunneling in building zone was also presented. The case study verfies the validity and reliability of theory approaches and which can be serve as reference for similar engineering.

0742266849	Visco-elastic back-analysis of experimental cavity in underground factory	Based on the measured data of a certain experimental cavity in underground factory, the paper studied a visco-elastic back analysis method of experimental cavity. It assumed that the initial rock stresses is in linear distribution, all layers of strata are regarded as layered homogeneous in calculation districts, and this model is applied to doing calculation. As to the slant and layered stratum, flaccidity interlayer and fault texture, they separately plotted into elements to simulate the distributive character of layered rock mass and some anisotropic macro-effects of cavity engineering on the stresses and strains in finite element (FEM) analysis. According to the geological data, we evaluated rock medium characteristic parameters on these strata away from the cavity to simplify the calculation. The paper calculated the value of initial rock stresses by elastic back analysis, and achieved the material visco-elastic parameters of the surroundings in neighboring experimental cavity by applying tri-element model to back analysis. It provided reliable basis for the engineering designs and supports.
