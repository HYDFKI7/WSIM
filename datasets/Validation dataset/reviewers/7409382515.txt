14844295013	Fluorometric assay for alcohol sulfotransferase	A sensitive fluorometric assay was developed for alcohol sulfotransferase (AST). This was the first continuous fluorometric assay reported for AST. It used 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate regenerated from 3-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate by a recombinant phenol sulfotransferase (PST) using 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate as the sulfuryl group donor. The recombinant PST did not use the alcohol substrate under the designed condition, and the sensitivity for AST activity was found to be comparable to that of radioactive assay as reported in the literature. The change of fluorescence intensity of 4-methylumbelliferone corresponded directly to the amount of active AST and was sensitive enough to measure nanogram or picomole amounts of the enzyme activity. This fluorometric assay was used to determine the activities of AST as purified form and in crude extracts of pig liver, rat liver, and Escherichia coli. Some properties of human dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase were determined by this method and were found to be comparable to published data. Under similar assay conditions, the contaminated activities of arylsulfatase in crude extracts were also determined. This method not only is useful for the routine and detailed kinetic study of this important class of enzymes but also has the potential for the development of a high-throughput procedure using microplate reader. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

0030462044	Two phenol sulfotransferase species from one cDNA: Nature of the differences	A phenol sulfotransferase from rat liver (EC 2.8.2.9), expressed in Escherichia coli from a single cDNA, was purified as two separable but catalytically active proteins. The proteins appeared to be identical to each other and to the natural liver sulfotransferase by comparison of their amino acid constitution, amino-terminal end group, and interaction with a polyclonal antibody raised against the liver enzyme. Each of the recombinant forms, α and β, catalyzed the sulfuryl group transfer from 4- nitrophenylsulfate to an acceptor phenol, a reaction in which 3'-phospho- adenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) is a necessary intermediate. Only form β, however, catalyzes the physiological transfer of a sulfuryl group from 3'- phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the free phenol. Evidence is presented that sulfotransferase α, but not β, has 1 mol of PAP tightly bound per enzyme dimer. The ability to utilize PAPS as a sulfate donor could be altered: form could be treated and purified as form β to acquire the ability to use PAPS, whereas form β was treated by extended incubation with PAP, lost its ability to use PAPS, and was purified as form α.

0032212455	Colorimetric determination of the purity of 3'-phospho adenosine 5'- phosphosulfate and natural abundance of 3'-phospho adenosine 5'-phosphate at picomole quantities	This work presents novel colorimetric methods not only to measure 3'- phospho adenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) and 3'-phospho adenosine 5'- phosphosulfate (PAPS) in the range of picomoles, but also to determine the purity of PAPS or PAP contaminants in PAPS in the range of nanomoles. These methods exploit the availability of overexpressed phenol sulfotransferase (PST) and the fact that sulfuryl group transfer requires the use of PAP or PAPS as a cofactor or cosubstrate. Experimental results indicate that absorption at 400 nm due to the production of 4-nitrophenol (pNP) is catalyzed by PST when the sulfuryl group transfers from 4-nitrophenylsulfate (pNPS) to PAP or to 2-napthol. In the absence of an acceptor substrate, PAPS is hydrolyzed to PAP by PST and is determined by sulfation with pNPS before and after this reaction. The change of absorption of pNP at 400 nm corresponds to the amount of PAP that is hydrolyzed from PAPS. Moreover, a standard curve is constructed using authentic PAP and PAp-free PST. Furthermore, this curve is used to determine the amount of PAP in extracts of pig liver, rat liver, and Escherichia coli.

0032548889	Effects of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate on the activity and folding of phenol sulfotransferase	Known spectroscopic and kinetic data are used to formulate pathways of the physiological and transfer reactions and the substrate inhibition of phenol sulfotransferase. Kinetic mechanisms indicate that release of PAP from enzyme complex is required for the physiological reaction but not for the transfer reaction. The pathways explain rate difference between the physiological and transfer reactions since the release of PAP is the rate- limiting step of the former reaction. Two enzyme species of phenol sulfotransferase which distinguish the physiological and transfer reaction were found to involve the binding of PAP. Differences between two forms of phenol sulfotransferase, α and β, indicate that they assemble through different folding process. It is demonstrated that only α enzyme renatures in the presence of PAP and ,β enzyme renatures only in the absence of PAP in vitro. In the over-expressed system, formation of α and β phenol sulfotmnsferase is also dependent on the availability of PAP in Escherichia colt'. It is concluded that folding of phenol sulfotransferase is assisted by PAP to form α enzyme. In the absence of PAP, β form of phenol sulfotransferase is produced.

In this scheme, the poly-Si NW channel is formed by cleverly employing the poly-Si sidewall spacer technique. In addition, the poly-Si NW channel is genuinely exposed to the environment after the poly-Si sidewall spacer formation in the new scheme. This unique feature, together with its simplicity and low-cost, makes this approach very suitable for applications and manufacturing of bio-logic sensing devices.

2942676812	Biochemical sensing with photodiode	To deal with the complex and huge amount of biological information, more efficient instruments are needed in this post-genomic era for medical diagnosis, curing diseases, prevention of terrorist acts, and many other bioanalytical problems. The development of semiconductor sensors and integrated circuit for biochemical diagnosis may be the answer for an accurate, portable, relatively inexpensive, and easy-to-use biosensing device. A complementary metal oxide semiconductor manufactured through a standard industrial process for biochemical sensing has been successfully designed. The biochemical signals were further magnified and analyzed by an integrated circuit. The design of a portable system was proposed, which may become a convenient diagnostic kit on the go. Finally, a functional system that uses commercially available photodiode and other electronic devices was assembled. The set up provides a test platform that can be used as a model for an integrated system for the IC design in a semiconductor chip.

33644621711	Protein metal binding residue prediction based on neural networks	Over one-third of protein structures contain metal ions, which are the necessary elements in life systems. Traditionally, structural biologists were used to investigate properties of metalloproteins (proteins which bind with metal ions) by physical means and interpreting the function formation and reaction mechanism of enzyme by their structures and observations from experiments in vitro. Most of proteins have primary structures (amino acid sequence information) only; however, the 3-dimension structures are not always available. In this paper, a direct analysis method is proposed to predict the protein metal-binding amino acid residues from its sequence information only by neural networks with sliding window-based feature extraction and biological feature encoding techniques. In four major bulk elements (Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium, and Sodium), the metal-binding residues are identified by the proposed method with higher than 90% sensitivity and very good accuracy under 5-fold cross validation. With such promising results, it can be extended and used as a, powerful methodology for metal-binding characterization from rapidly increasing protein sequences in the future. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

33750116086	Protein changes between dormant and dormancybroken seeds of Prunus campanulata Maxim	Seed dormancy is regulated by complex networks in order to optimize the timing of germination. However, the biochemical basis of the regulation of seed dormancy is still poorly understood. Many temperate timber species, which are of ecological and/or economic interest, are deeply dormant in seeds, such as Prunus campanulata. Freshly harvested seeds require warm plus cold stratification to break dormancy before they can begin to germinate. According to the results of germination, both warm and cold stratifications are the critical influences for breaking seed dormancy. Significant variations in seed proteins were observed by 2-DE before and after the breaking of seed dormancy. Among the 320, 455, and 491 reproducibly detected spots on the cotyledons, embryos, and testae, respectively, 71 dramatic changes in abundances were observed following warm and/or cold stratification. Among these protein spots, dehydrin, prunin 1 precursor, prunin 2 precursor, and prunin 2 were identified by MS and sequence comparison. The implications of protein changes in relation to the breaking of seed dormancy and germination are discussed. This is the first report of a proteomic analysis of dormancy breaking in woody plant seeds. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

33750148550	Reactions of phenol sulfotransferase with nucleotides	All sulfotransferases require adenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate (PAP) or 3′-phospho adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to catalyze sulfuryl group transfer. Thus, PAP is used as cofactor by phenol sulfotransferase (PST) for moving sulfuryl group from p-nitrophenyl sulfate (pNPS) to other phenols. PST also tightly binds to a variety of nucleotides and we found that sulfuryl group can be released from pNPS in the presence of several nucleotides other than PAP or PAPS. Binding of nucleotides by PST is rather non-selective. We determined binding constants of a variety of nucleotides and examined their potential as cofactors or substrates of phenol sulfotransferase. Structure and functional groups of nucleotides and their requirements for PST binding are examined. We found that even ribose and adenine, two major components of the adenosine nucleotides, tightly bound to PST. Some nucleotides, such as adenosine 2′, 5′bisphosphate and AMP, accept and transfer sulfuryl group analogue to PAP with less efficiency. Other nucleotides, such as ADP, involve in both sulfuryl group transfer and hydrolysis of phospho ester after sutfation. While unable to. hydrolyze pNPS directly, PST was found to hydrolyze PAPS at alkaline pH. Kinetic data and NMR are Used to determine the reaction pathways of PST catalyzed sulfation and hydrolysis. In this presentation, we would like to demonstrate that PST uses a broad range of nucleotides as substrate or cofactor for sulfuryt group transfer.

33750184176	Identification of novel hydroxysteroid-sulfating cytosolic SULTs, SULT2 ST2 and SULT2 ST3, from zebrafish: Cloning, expression, characterization, and developmental expression	By searching the expressed sequence tag database, two zebrafish cDNAs encoding putative cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) were identified. Sequence analysis indicated that these two zebrafish SULTs belong to the cytosolic SULT2 gene family. The recombinant form of these two novel zebrafish SULTs, designated SULT2 ST2 and SULT2 ST3, were expressed using the pGEX-2TK glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion system and purified from transformed BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Purified GST-fusion protein form of SULT2 ST2 and SULT2 ST3 exhibited strong sulfating activities toward dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and corticosterone, respectively, among various endogenous compounds tested as substrates. Both enzymes displayed pH optima at ∼6.5. Kinetic constants of the two enzymes, as well as the GST-fusion protein form of the previously identified SULT2 ST1, with DHEA and corticosterone as substrates were determined. Developmental stage-dependent expression experiments revealed distinct patterns of expression of SULT2 ST2 and SULT2 ST3, as well as the previously identified SULT2 ST1, during embryonic development and throughout the larval stage onto maturity. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33846244290	A comparison of two methods for transforming non-normal manufacturing data	Many statistical methods applied to manufacturing quality control and operations management have been under the assumption that the process characteristic investigated is normally distributed. If the process characteristic is not normally distributed, a popular approach is to transform the non-normal data into a normal one. In this paper, we consider the Box-Cox transformation, and compare the transformation power using two different parameter estimation methods, including the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the method of percentiles (MOP). The performance comparison is based on the pass rate under the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. The results show that, in general, the MOP has better pass rate, while the MLE has smaller power variation for most cases investigated. For small sample size (n=5, 10) both methods perform equally well. For large sample size, the MOP is recommended due to its simplicity and significantly higher pass rate. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.

38049012823	Immunohistochemical analysis of a novel dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase-like protein in Drosophila neural circuits	Sulfotransferase (ST)-catalyzed sulfation plays an important role in various neuronal functions such as homeostasis of catecholamine neurotransmitters and hormones. Drosophila is a popular model for the study of memory and behavioral manifestations because it is able to mimic the intricate neuroregulation and recognition in humans. However, there has been no evidence indicating that cytosolic ST(s) is(are) present in Drosophila. The aim of this study is to investigate whether or not cytosolic ST(s) is(are) expressed in the Drosophila nervous system. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) ST-like protein in Drosophila brain and a sensitive fluorometric assay revealed its sulfating activity toward DHEA. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated this DHEA ST-like protein to be abundant in specific neurons as well as in several bundles of nerve fibers in Drosophila. Clarification of a possible link between ST and a neurotransmitter-mediated effect may eventually aid in designing approaches for alleviating neuronal disorders in humans. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0033939210	Identification, purification, and characterization of a thermophilic imidase from pig liver	This study investigates thermophilic imidase activity of the liver. We demonstrate that imidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of imides at a temperature substantially higher than that of its native environment. Then, a thermophilic imidase is purified to homogeneity from pig liver, and its thermoproperties are studied. About 2500-fold of purification and 15% yield of imidase activity are obtained after ammonium sulfate precipitation, octyl, DEAE, chelation, and gel filtration chromatography. While avoiding heat treatment for the protein purification, this study also indicates that only one enzyme is responsible for the imidase activity. This homogenous enzyme prefers to catalyze hydrolysis of imides at above 60°C rather than at the body temperature of a pig. Although stable at below 50°C, imidase quickly loses its activity at above 65°C. Thus, the temperature effect on imidase activity is limited mainly by its thermostability. Substrate specificity of imidase is also temperature dependent. Our results demonstrate that the hydrolysis of physiological substrates is the most temperature dependent and that of hydantoins is the least temperature dependent. When increasing the reaction temperature from 25 to 60°C, specific activities increase 50- and 60-fold for dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine, respectively. The temperature effect on the K(m) and V(max) of imidase is substrate dependent. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The ratio value of Ion Ioff is as high as 104, indicating the presence of a semiconducting channel. A passivation layer over the source/drain electrode greatly suppresses the liquid-gate leakage by about three orders of magnitude. The channel currents are noticeably distinct between two liquid samples: distilled water and aqueous solution (1× 10-4 M NaCl). This biological sensing ability is attributed to the different electrical double-layer capacitances with respect to the bulk part of the channel.

0034685668	Nucleotide binding and sulfation catalyzed by phenol sulfotransferase	The sulfation of a nucleotide is an indispensable step for the sulfuryl group transfer in a biological system. The product and cosubstrate of sulfotransferase in physiological condition are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (PAP) and 3'-phospho adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), respectively. We find that ribose and adenine, two major parts of the adenosine nucleotide, bind tightly to phenol sulfotransferase (PST) separately, and various nucleotides also bind tightly to PST. We determine the dissociation constants of a variety of nucleotides and examine their potential as cofactors or cosubstrates of PST. Using 4-nitrophenyl sulfate as the sulfuryl group donor, three nucleotides, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (2',5'-PAP), and adenosine 2':3'-cyclic phosphate 5'-phosphate (2':3'-cyclic PAP), are shown here for the first time to be sulfated at 5'-phopho position by a PST catalyzed reaction.

48549089899	Identification and characterization of two novel cytosolic sulfotransferases, SULT1 ST7 and SULT1 ST8, from zebrafish	Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) constitute a family of Phase II detoxification enzymes that are involved in the protection against potentially harmful xenobiotics as well as the regulation and homeostasis of endogenous compounds. Compared with humans and rodents, the zebrafish serves as an excellent model for studying the role of SULTs in the detoxification of environmental pollutants including environmental estrogens. By searching the expressed sequence tag database, two zebrafish cDNAs encoding putative SULTs were identified. Sequence analysis indicated that these two putative zebrafish SULTs belong to the SULT1 gene family. The recombinant form of these two novel zebrafish SULTs, designated SULT1 ST7 and SULT1 ST8, were expressed using the pGEX-2TK glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion system and purified from transformed BL21 (DE3) cells. Purified GST-fusion protein form of SULT1 ST7 and SULT1 ST8 exhibited strong sulfating activities toward environmental estrogens, particularly hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), among various endogenous and xenobiotic compounds tested as substrates. pH-dependence experiments showed that SULT1 ST7 and SULT1 ST8 displayed pH optima at 6.5 and 8.0, respectively. Kinetic parameters of the two enzymes in catalyzing the sulfation of catechin and chlorogenic acid as well as 3-chloro-4-biphenylol were determined.

57149125703	Effect of metal binding and posttranslational lysine carboxylation on the activity of recombinant hydantoinase	Bacterial hydantoinase possesses a binuclear metal center in which two metal ions are bridged by a posttranslationally carboxylated lysine. How the carboxylated lysine and metal binding affect the activity of hydantoinase was investigated. A significant amount of iron was always found in Agrobacterium radiobacter hydantoinase purified from unsupplemented cobalt-, manganese-, or zinc-amended Escherichia coli cell cultures. A titration curve for the reactivation of apohydantoinase with cobalt indicates that the first metal was preferentially bound but did not give any enzyme activity until the second metal was also attached to the hydantoinase. The pH profiles of the metal-reconstituted hydantoinase were dependent on the specific metal ion bound to the active site, indicating a direct involvement of metal in catalysis. Mutation of the metal binding site residues, H57A, H59A, K148A, H181A, H237A, and D313A, completely abolished hydantoinase activity but preserved about half of the metal content, except for K148A, which lost both metals in its active site. However, the activity of K148A could be chemically rescued by short-chain carboxylic acids in the presence of cobalt, indicating that the carboxylated lysine was needed to coordinate the binuclear ion within the active site of hydantoinase. The mutant D313E enzyme was also active but resulted in a pH profile different from that of wild-type hydantoinase. A mechanism for hydantoinase involving metal, carboxylated K148, and D313 was proposed. © 2008 SBIC.

66449124488	Dimerization is responsible for the structural stability of human sulfotransferase 1a1	Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) are responsible for the metabolism of a variety of drugs, xenobiotics, and endogenous compounds. Most cytosolic SULTs are found to be homodimers. However, transformation between monomeric and dimeric SULTs can be achieved by a single amino acid mutation. The importance of quaternary structure for cytosolic sulfotransferase was investigated using recombinant human SULT1A1, a homodimer, and its monomeric mutant (V270E). The differences between dimeric and monomeric SULT1A1 were examined by size-exclusion liquid chro- matography, enzyme kinetics, substrate binding affinity, thermal inactivation, conformational stability, and circular dichroism. Vari-ations, especially on their secondary structures and stability, between homodimer and monomer of human SULT1A1 were observed. It was found that the active site of SULT1A1 was not significantly perturbed after the change of its quaternary structure according to SULT1A1 kinetics and substrate binding affinity. However, the stability of monomeric SULT1A1 is significantly decreased. We proposed that the importance of human SULT1A1 as a homodimer was to maintain its structural stability, and the change of secondary structure was responsible for alternating its quaternary structure.

71449093828	TIM barrel protein structure classification using alignment approach and best hit strategy	The classification of protein structures is essential for their function determination in bioinformatics. It has been estimated that around 10% of all known enzymes have TIM barrel domains from the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database. With its high sequence variation and diverse functionalities, TIM barrel protein becomes to be an attractive target for protein engineering and for the evolution study. Hence, in this paper, an alignment approach with the best hit strategy is proposed to classify the TIM barrel protein structure in terms of superfamily and family levels in the SCOP. This work is also used to do the classification for class level in the Enzyme nomenclature (ENZYME) database. Two testing data sets, TIM40D and TIM95D, both are used to evaluate this approach. The resulting classification has an overall prediction accuracy rate of 90.3% for the superfamily level in the SCOP, 89.5% for the family level in the SCOP and 70.1% for the class level in the ENZYME. These results demonstrate that the alignment approach with the best hit strategy is a simple and viable method for the TIM barrel protein structure classification, even only has the amino acid sequences information. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

On the contrary, the enzymes of detoxification are known to catalyze unlimited number of substrates containing similar function groups that may have significant structural variation. This review explores nature's strategy to design enzymes with special properties. Areas covered in this review: We review articles from 1981 to 2009, with special focus on the relationships of sequence, structure and function of cytosolic sulfotransferases and dihydropyrimidinase (DHP). What the reader will gain: Specific amino acids responsible for substrate inhibition, substrate binding orientations, substrate specificity, quaternary structures and inactivation of sulfotransferases and DHP related enzymes are elucidated. Susceptibility to some diseases possibly resulted from the mutation of a single amino acid that causes dysfunction of these enzymes. Terminal deletion of amino acid that may affect surface interaction, subunit dissociation, stability alteration and then cause the syndrome of DHP deficiency is discussed. Take home message: Based on the multiple sequence/structure analysis and with sufficient information from other members of the same enzyme families, the origin and mechanism of specific enzyme actions and proteins assembly can be clarified and predicted. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

The porous OTFT exhibits a fast, sensitive, and reversible response to ammonia gas with a detection limit as 500 ppb, whereas the OTFT without porous structure has a slow response and a poor recovery behavior. The sensing mechanism dominated by the dissociation of hydroxyl groups of the polymer dielectric layer is raised and discussed. The proposed device is the first OTFT-based ammonia sensor with reversible response and high sensitivity in low parts-per-million range. It is promising for the development of a diagnostic breath analysis system. © 2011 IEEE.

84859073152	Microfluidic synthesis of microfibers for magnetic-responsive controlled drug release and cell culture	This study demonstrated the fabrication of alginate microfibers using a modular microfluidic system for magnetic-responsive controlled drug release and cell culture. A novel two-dimensional fluid-focusing technique with multi-inlets and junctions was used to spatiotemporally control the continuous laminar flow of alginate solutions. The diameter of the manufactured microfibers, which ranged from 211 μm to 364 μm, could be well controlled by changing the flow rate of the continuous phase. While the model drug, diclofenac, was encapsulated into microfibers, the drug release profile exhibited the characteristic of a proper and steady release. Furthermore, the diclofenac release kinetics from the magnetic iron oxide-loaded microfibers could be controlled externally, allowing for a rapid drug release by applying a magnetic force. In addition, the successful culture of glioblastoma multiforme cells in the microfibers demonstrated a good structural integrity and environment to grow cells that could be applied in drug screening for targeting cancer cells. The proposed microfluidic system has the advantages of ease of fabrication, simplicity, and a fast and low-cost process that is capable of generating functional microfibers with the potential for biomedical applications, such as drug controlled release and cell culture. © 2012 Lin et al.

84860431558	Ultrasensitive detection of avian influenza virus by using CMOS impedimetric sensor arrays	This work presents miniaturized CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) impedimetric sensors for detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) in the femtomolar level. The sensing resolution is significantly enhanced owing to monolithic sensor integration to reduce the parasitic effect and the use of sub-μm interdigitated microelectrodes to promote signal coupling efficiency. The 4x4 sensor array contains four electrode designs of different sizes. Capacitance changes associated with surface modification, functionalization, and DNA hybridization were extracted from measured frequency responses based on an equivalent circuit. Hybridization of AIV H5 capture and target DNA produced a percentage capacitance change of -12.8±3% among the four designs for target DNA concentrations from 1 fM to 10 fM, while capacitance increases were observed for non-specific binding of the H5 and H7 DNA probes. © 2012 IEEE.

84861229583	A nano switch mechanism for the redox-responsive sulfotransferase	Cellular redox signaling is important in diverse physiological and pathological processes. The activity of rat phenol sulfotransferase (rSULT1A1), which is important for the metabolism of hormone and drug, is subjected to redox regulation. Two cysteines, Cys232 and Cys66, nanometer away from each other and from the enzyme active site were proposed to form disulfide bond to regulate the activity of rSULT1A1. A nano switch, composed of a flexible loop from amino acid residues 59-70, explained how this long distance interaction between two cysteines can be achieved. The enzyme properties were investigated through site-directed muatagnesis, circular dichroism, enzyme kinetics and homologous modeling of the rSULT1A1 structures. We proposed that the formation of disulfide bond between Cys232 and Cys66 induced conformational changes of sulfotransferase, then in turn affected its nucleotide binding and enzyme activity. This discovery was extended to understand the possible redox regulation of other sulfotransferases from different organisms. The redox switch can be created in other redox-insensitive sulfotransferases, such as human phenol sulfotransferase (hSULT1A1) and human alcohol sulfotransferase (hSULT2A1), to produce mutant enzymes with redox regulation capacity. This study strongly suggested that redox regulation of drug and hormone metabolism can be significantly varied even though the sequence and structure of SULT1A1 of human and rat have a high degree of homology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862808281	Ultrasensitive and label-free detection of pathogenic avian influenza DNA by using CMOS impedimetric sensors	This work presents miniaturized CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensors for non-faradic impedimetric detection of AIV (avian influenza virus) oligonucleotides. The signal-to-noise ratio is significantly improved by monolithic sensor integration to reduce the effect of parasitic capacitances. The use of sub-μm interdigitated microelectrodes is also beneficial for promoting the signal coupling efficiency. Capacitance changes associated with surface modification, functionalization, and DNA hybridization were extracted from the measured frequency responses based on an equivalent-circuit model. Hybridization of the AIV H5 capture and target DNA probes produced a capacitance reduction of -13.2 ± 2.1% for target DNA concentrations from 1. fM to 10. fM, while a capacitance increase was observed when H5 target DNA was replaced with non-complementary H7 target DNA. With the demonstrated superior sensing capabilities, this miniaturized CMOS sensing platform shows great potential for label-free point-of-care biosensing applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84862729239	Surface effect of assembling enzyme and modulation of surface enzyme activity with electric potential stress	The fluorescent marker of rhodamine B amine is successfully used to evaluate the immobilization capability onto silicon-based patterns fabricated by semiconductor manufacturing. Only the silicon dioxide surface, by means of fluorescent observation, can immobilize the rhodamine molecule by the sequential linkage of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and glutaraldehyde. The phenol sulfotransferase enzyme is also successfully immobilized onto the silicon dioxide surface by the linking molecules of APTES and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohezane-1-carboxylate in the home-made apparatus. The enzyme activity of the sulfotransferase is determined from the absorbance of 4-nitrophenol at 400 nm wavelength. The surface immobilized enzyme remains its activity for catalytic reaction at least 120-min duration. The surface saturation effect on the activity of immobilized enzyme is explained and ascribed to the surface diffusion effect of electric double layers. We can success control the surface immobilized enzyme by electric potential stress. The activity of enzyme is reduced under negative potential, while is enhanced under positive potential. The electric potential can induce the enzyme structure variation and modulate the enzyme activity due to the electrostatic effect. © 2012 by ESG.

84862735148	Label-free detection of prostate specific antigen using a silicon nanobelt field-effect transistor	In this study, we proposed a silicon nanobelt field-effect transistor (FET) to detect prostate specific antigen (PSA). The nanobelt FET device displayed n-channel depletion characteristics. The immobilization of prostate specific antibody (anti-PSA) molecules was attached onto the nanobelt FET surface by using the aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde linked to the amino groups of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The shift in the drain current vs time curves of a nanobelt FET biosensor revealed that the electrical signal had a logarithmic relationship with respect to the concentration of the PSA, and detection capability was estimated in the 5 pg/mL level. To enhance the sensitivity of a nanobelt FET biosensor, this biosensor was designed by inserting arginine molecules between glutaraldehyde and APTES. Therefore, the detection capability of the developed sensor was extended to 50 fg/mL. Also, the relationship between the current shift and the logarithm of PSA concentration was exhibited linearity in the range 50 fg/mL - 500 pg/mL. The excellent electrical results of this label-free PSA nanobelt FET biosensor suggested that such biosensor might be potentially useful tools for biological research and future prostate cancer screening. © 2012 by ESG.

We proposed a DNA recovery system that can easily be adapted to DNA chip or DNA biosensor for fast identification and confirmation of target DNA. This method was based on the re-hybridization of DNA target with a recovery DNA to free the DNA probe. Functionalized silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNW FET) was demonstrated to monitor such specific DNA-DNA interaction using high pathogenic strain virus hemagglutinin 1 (H1) DNA of avian influenza (AI) as target. Specific electric changes were observed in real-time for AI virus DNA sensing and device recovery when nanowire surface of SiNW FET was modified with complementary captured DNA probe. The recovery based SiNW FET biosensor can be further developed for fast identification and further confirmation of a variety of influenza virus strains and other infectious diseases. © 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

84863247441	The electrical signals measurement for nanowire field effect transistors	This study demonstrates an electrical measurement method that analyses the properties of nanowire field effect transistors (nFETs) for biosensing applications. Detecting electrical signals is critical for all biosensing experiments especially for nFETs that are extremely sensitive to many types of environmental factors. Both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) measurements are frequently used. We study the pros and cons of these two methods for measuring electric signals from nFETs. Our results indicate that AC measurement generates less current data than DC measurement. However, the signal-to-noise ratio of AC measurement is higher than DC measurement. These results are important for future biosensing experiments and data analysis using nFETs. © 2011 IEEE.

0037195242	A single mutation converts the nucleotide specificity of phenol sulfotransferase from PAP to AMP	Sulfotransferases (STs) catalyze all the known biological sulfonations, in which a sulfuryl group from a common sulfonate donor such as 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) is transferred to a nucleophilic acceptor. In addition to PAPS, phenol sulfotransferase (PST), a member of the ST family, utilizes other nucleotides as substrates with much less catalytic efficiency [Lin, E. S., and Yang, Y. S. (2000) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 271, 818-822]. Six amino acid residues of PST have been chosen for mutagenesis studies on the basis of a model of PST and its sequence alignment with those of available cytosolic and membrane-anchored STs. Systematic analyses of the mutants reveal that Ser134 is important for the regulation of nucleotide specificity between 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) and adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP).

Nucleotides may serve as cosubstrate, cofactor, inhibitor, or regulator in an enzyme catalyzed sulfuryl group transfer reaction. We are trying to understand how nucleotide regulates the activity of phenol sulfotransferase (PST) through the expression of two enzyme forms. The homogeneous rat recombinant PST was obtained from Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide copurified was examined. The nucleotide was completely removed from inactive PST in high salt and oxidative condition. Total enzyme activity was recovered following incubation in reductive environment. Many nucleotides are known to tightly bind to PST but only one nucleotide, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP), was identified to combine with PST by ion-pair RP-HPLC, UV-visible spectra,

Here, we reported a process that contained only a single chromatographic step to purify a recombinant hydantoinase to homogeneity. Hydantoinase from Agrobacterium radiobacter NRRL B11291 was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified following heat treatments, high concentration alcohol precipitation, and chelating Sephacel chromatography. The recombinant hydantoinase did not contain any affinity tags from the plasmid. This simplified procedure provided a convenient way to obtain hydantoinase in high yield (71%) and high purity.

84870781294	Improved DNA detection by utilizing electrically neutral DNA probe in field-effect transistor measurements as evidenced by surface plasmon resonance imaging	Intensive efforts have been focused on the development of ultrasensitive DNA biosensors capable of quantitative gene expression analysis. Various neutralized nucleic acids have been demonstrated as alternative and attractive probe for the design of a DNA chip. However, the mechanism of the improvements has not been clearly revealed. In this investigation, we used a newly developed neutral ethylated DNA (E-DNA), a DNA analog with the "RO-P-O" backbone (wherein R could be methyl, ethyl, aryl, or alkyl group) obtained from synthetic procedures, and a silicon nanowire (SiNW) field-effect transistor (FET) to evaluate the difference in DNA detection performance while using E-DNA and DNA as probes. It is demonstrated that using the E-DNA probe in the FET measurement could have a significantly enhanced effect upon the detection sensitivity. Surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) was used to evidence the mechanism of the improved detection sensitivity. SPRi analysis showed the amounts of probe immobilization on the sensor surface and the hybridization efficiency were both enhanced with the use of E-DNA. Consequently, neutral ethylated DNA probe hold a great promise for DNA sensing, especially in the electrical-based sensor. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

84873748470	Fluorescence assay for protein post-translational tyrosine sulfation	We developed a fluorescent assay to conveniently determine the kinetics of protein sulfation, which is essential for understanding interface between protein sulfation and protein-protein interactions. Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) catalyzes protein sulfation using 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as sulfuryl group donor. In this report, PAPS was regenerated following sulfuryl group transfer between adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate catalyzed by phenol sulfotransferase (PST). The TPST and PST coupled enzyme platform continuously generated fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (MU) that was used to real-time monitor protein sulfation. Using a recombinant N utilization substance protein A fused Drosophila melanogaster tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, we demonstrated that the activity of TPST determined through MU fluorescence directly correlated with protein sulfation. Kinetic constants obtained with small P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 peptide (PSGL-1 peptide, MW 1541) or its large glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-PSGL-1, MW 27833) exhibited significant variation. This assay can be further developed to a high-throughput method for the characterization of TPSTs and for the identification and screening of their protein substrates. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The changes of biomolecules process are efficiently affected the charge at the nanowire surface; thus, the electrical characterization of NW-FET is changed. Although NW-FET is a well-known device in bioapplications, however, the intrinsic electrical characterization of NW-FET effect on real electrical measurement is not well studied. We present herein a novel measurement method to avoid errors in electrical characteristic of nanowire field-effect transistors. A physical model is developed to explore the effect of the leakage current, which is influenced by the charging effect of an equivalent capacitor in a NW-FET. We also present a sloped-gate voltage method to reduce the effect of equivalent capacitor in air, liquid, and phosphate buffered solution. The application of the sloped-gate voltage method significantly increases the stability of electrical characterization measurements. This method can also be easily applied to biosensing experiments. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

When compared with commercial semiconductor processes, the sidewall spacer technique has the advantages of simplicity and low cost. In this study, we employed a novel poly-Si NWFET device for real-time, label-free, and ultrahigh-sensitivity detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in human serum. Since serum proteome is very complex containing high levels of salts and other interfering compounds, we hereby developed a standard operating procedure for real-sample pretreatment to keep a proper pH value and ionic strength of the desalted serum and also utilized Tween 20 to serve as the passivation agent by surface modification on the NWFET to reduce nonspecific binding for medical diagnostic applications. We first modified 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane on the surface of a poly-Si nanowire device followed by glutaraldehyde functionalization, and the PSA antibodies were immobilized on the aldehyde terminal. While PSA was prepared in the buffers to maintain an appropriate pH value and ionic strength, the results indicated that the sensor could detect trace PSA at less than 5 fg/mL in a microfluidic channel.

Approximately 6000-fold purification and a 40% yield of fish imidase activity were obtained through ammonium sulfate precipitation, octyl, chelating, DEAE, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. This cold-adapted imidase was characterized by a specific activity 10- to a 100-fold higher than those of its thermophilic counterparts below room temperature (25°C or lower) conditions but less stable at elevated temperatures (40°C or higher). A less organized helical structure (compared to those of pig liver and bacterial imidases) was observed by circular dichroism. Furthermore, maleimide was first identified as a novel substrate of all imidases examined, and confirmed by HPLC and NMR analysis. These results constituted a first study to discover a novel cold-adapted imidase with surprising high activity. These findings might be also helpful for industrial application of imidase. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84908420013	Electromagnetic/magnetic-coupled targeting system for screw-hole locating in intramedullary interlocking-nail surgery	At present, intramedullary interlocking nails are widely used for bone-fracture fixation in orthopedic surgeries. Surgeons often use X-ray imaging to find the actual location of the distal screw-holes of the nail after the nail is inserted into the medullary canal of a bone for fixation. Thus, the patients and medical team are inevitably exposed to radioactivity. In this paper, we report a radiation-free electromagnetic/magnetic-coupled targeting system to locate the distal screw-holes of the nail used in interlocking-nail surgery. The targeting system consists of a c-shaped electromagnet with a pick-up coil, a highly permeable curved silicon-steel strip embedded on the nail, a guiding mechanism, and electronic measuring instruments. An alternative current is applied to the electromagnet to generate a uniform magnetic field/flux in the electromagnet's air gap. When the nail inserted into the medullary canal of a bone is scanned through or rotated in the air gap of the electromagnet, the magnetic flux in the air gap is influenced by the silicon-steel strip embedded on the nail. The variation of the magnetic flux induces a voltage response in the pick-up coil due to electromagnetic induction. The pattern of the voltage response is analyzed to establish a criterion for screw-hole targeting. The results obtained using this criterion reveal that the maximum targeting error of the location and orientation targeting for a screw-hole with a diameter of 5 mm is <2 mm and 10°, respectively. Thus, the system/approach is sufficiently simple and accurate to be used by surgeons in clinical surgery.
