37249072757	Systematic and adaptive characterization approach for behavior modeling and correction of dynamic nonlinear transmitters	This paper proposes a comprehensive and systematic characterization methodology that is suitable for the forward and reverse behavior modeling of wireless transmitters (Txs) driven by wideband-modulated signals. This characterization approach can be implemented in adaptive radio systems since it does not require particular signal or training sequences. The importance of the nature of the driving signal and its average power on the behavior of radio-frequency Txs are experimentally investigated. Critical issues related to the proposed characterization approach are analytically studied. This includes a new delay-estimation method that achieves good accuracy with low computational complexity. In addition, the receiver linear calibration and its noise budget are investigated. To demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, a full characterization (including the memoryless nonlinearity and the memory effects) of a 100-W Tx driven by a multicarrier wideband code-division multiple-access signal is carried out, and its forward and reverse models are identified. Cascading the identified reverse model derived using the proposed methodology and the Tx prototype leads to excellent compensation of the static nonlinearities and the memory effects exhibited by the latter.

Such a modulator will be vital for optimizing the performance of radio over fiber links by improving modulation efficiency and receiver sensitivity and by removing fiber chromatic dispersion induced RF power fading. It is shown that a wide range of OCSR tunability can be obtained by altering bias voltage of dMZM, and optimum OCSR, to maximize the output RF power, depends on RF modulation index and extinction ratio of the integrated dMZM. Good agreement between theory, simulation, and experiment is obtained. For typical extinction ratio and low modulation index, it is found that an OCSR of 0 dB is optimum to maximize RF carrier power. However, for multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) radio, the best error vector magnitude (EVM) of -21.8 dB is obtained experimentally at an OCSR of ∼ 5.4 dB due to avoidance of clipping induced nonlinear distortion. © 2011 IEEE.

80052865368	Distortion analysis for RoF system based on optical carrier suppression modulation	The Mach-Zehnder electro-optical modulator is widely used in RoF system. The nonlinearity of the light to current(L-I) conversion curve of an Mach-Zehnder electro-optical modulator is an important cause of intra-band, inter-band Harmonic Distortions(HD) and inter-modulation distortions(IMD). This nonlinearity of Mach-Zehnder modulator greatly deteriorates the performance of RoF system based on optical carrier suppression modulation. An exact analytical solution for arbitrary order inter-modulator distortion(IMD) and harmonic distortion of the modulator driven by a two-tone signal is derived. Analytical results indicate that the third-order IMD of the system increases with the increasing modulation index of the RF signal and is independent of the offset phase shift of the modulator. In addition, when the offset phase shift equals π/2, there are only odd-order harmonics. And there are only even-order harmonics, when the offset phase shift equals 0(or π). These results are then confirmed by simulation based on Optisystem. With the presented analytical expression, it is convenient to design an analog optical communication system, precisely predict the nonlinear characteristics of the external modulator and optimize the system's performance. © 2011 IEEE.

81455140687	Behavior modeling for multi-carrier multi-mode power amplifiers using real-valued time-delay RBF networks	This paper proposes a real-valued time-delay radial basis function (RVTDRBF) networks suitable for dynamic modeling of the baseband nonlinear behaviors of the multi-carrier multi-mode power amplifiers (MMPA). Parameters (weights and centers) of the proposed model are identified using the orthogonal least square (OLS) algorithm. In order to verify the model ability for modeling the nonlinearity of MMPA, a 110-W LDMOS class-AB PA and three different test signals are used. The three different test signals are three-carrier CDMA2000, one-carrier WCDMA and twelve-carrier CDMA2000, respectively. The accuray of the proposed model is investigated with the normalized mean square error (NMSE), the amplitude and the output spectrum.

84858010959	Influence of finite extinction ratio of MZM on optically generated millimeter-wave	Optical generation of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) is very attractive for the applications such as radio-over-fiber for wireless communications, imaging, and radio astronomy observations. The optical generation of mm-wave signal employing Double-sideband with Carrier Suppression (DSBCS) modulation using a single-electrode Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM) is theoretically analyzed. The impact of the finite Extinction Ratio (ER) of MZM on the generated mm-wave signal is discussed. An experimental setup using a single-electrode MZM based on DSBCS modulation is built. A stable millimeter-wave signal tunable from 46 to 60 GHz with less than 1.5 dB power variation is obtained by tuning the electrical driving signal from 23 to 30 GHz.

84860619193	New method for generation of RZ/CSRZ-DQPSK signals based on MZM	Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) have attracted significant attentions for its advantages of receiver sensitivity and tolerance to fiber nonlinearity in high speed and high spectral efficiency optical transmission system. A novel scheme, using dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator(MZM) for generation of return-to-zero DQPSK(RZ-DQPSK) signal and carrier-suppressed return-to-zero DQPSK (CSRZ-DQPSK) signal, was proposed. It needed one MZM to generate DQPSK signal and another to curve RZ/CSRZ pulse out of the NRZ-phase modulated signal. An exact analytical solution for this method was derived. The proposed method simplified the generation of RZ/CSRZ-DQPSK signal and was expected to be more cost-effective due to the reduction in requirement of modulator. Simulation results show that CSRZ-DQPSK has a more compact spectrum than that of RZ-DQPSK because of carrier suppression. The received signal has a clear eye diagram under balanced coherent detection.

84861961048	Performance improvement for a WCDMA radio over fiber system using digital pre-distorter	In this paper, a Radio Over Fiber (ROF) system with a Digital Pre-Distorter (DPD) for WCDMA signal transmission is investigated. A Look-Up Table (LUT) based DPD and a Memory Polynomial (MP) DPD are applied in the ROF link so as to suppress the out-of-band spurious spectrum and improve the transmission performance. The experimental results show that the out-of-band emission due to existence of the third-order Inter-Modulation Distortion (IMD3) is obviously suppressed by these two DPD. An Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) improvement of 8 dB is obtained for a single-carrier WCDMA signal transmission. These two DPD have equal ability in linearization of the ROF system for a three-carrier WCDMA signal transmission.

This model has four Tapped Delay Lines (TDLs), which account for the memory effect of the DPA. The structure of the RVTDRRBF model is simpler than the traditional FeedForward Neural Networks (FFNNs) model. Weights and centers of the proposed model can be resolved by the Orthogonal Least Square (OLS) and Singular Value De-composition (SVD) algorithm. A three-carrier Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) signal is taken as the test signal. The simulation results in frequency-domain and time-domain for a DPA with 51 dBm output illustrate a good agreement between the RVTDRRBF model and measurement data. Moreover, comparing the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) of RVTDRRBF model, memory polynomial model and RVTDRBF model, it can be noticed that the proposed RVTDRRBF model is more accurate than the RVTDRBF model and the memory polynomial model in modeling the strong dynamic nonlinearity of the DPAs. © 2012 Science Press, Institute of Electronics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84864080455	Nonlinear characterization of concurrent dual-band RF power amplifiers	In this paper, the synchronous concurrent dual-band RF signal is used to drive the RF Power Amplifier (PA). The nonlinear characterization of a concurrent dual-band RF PA is discussed while two band signals in the dual-band are modulated by CDMA2000 and WCDMA signals. When the two band signals in the dual-band of the PA are modulated with the same signals, it is found that the nonlinearity of the PA can be expressed by any of the two corresponding baseband data. On the other hand, when the two band signals in the dual-band of the PA are modulated with two different signals, the PA nonlinearity cannot be characterized by any of the two corresponding baseband data. In this case, its nonlinearity has to be denoted by a composite signals consisting of the two baseband signals. Consequently, the requirements for the speed of the A/D converter can be largely reduced. The experimental results with CDMA2000 and WCDMA signals demonstrate the speed of the A/D converter required is only 30 M Sample Per Second (SaPS), but it will be at least 70 M SaPS for the conventional method. © 2012 Science Press, Institute of Electronics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84864614807	A 460MHz Doherty power amplifier for IMT-advanced systems	In this work, a Doherty power amplifier is presented for IMT-Advanced system at 450-470MHz frequency band. An imperfect Quarter-wave transmission line, which consisted of two shunt capacitors and a series microstrip line, is adopted to replace the bulky impedance inverter quarter-wave transmission line for designing the Doherty power amplifier (PA). Both the traditional and proposed structures for the Doherty power amplifiers were implemented. Comparing with the traditional Doherty amplifier, the size of the circuit and the manufacturing costs are decreased obviously. The measurement results of the proposed Doherty PA exhibit good performance as well as the traditional Doherty power amplifier. For a input signal with a 7.8dB Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), the measured drain efficiency of the proposed Doherty power amplifier is 48.5% at an average output power of 43.0 dBm, which is a 7.8dB backed -off the peak output power. Moreover, in order to improve the linearity of the proposed Doherty power amplifier, the augmented Hammerstein and polynomial predistorter are used to linearize the proposed Doherty power amplifier. After digital predistortion, the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) reaches -45.5dBc at an average output power of 43.0 dBm, which can satisfy the requirements of the IMT-Advanced systems. © 2012 IEEE.

84864616649	Switching characteristics of bias circuits of RF power amplifiers for TD-LTE systems	The RF power amplifiers(PAs) for TDD (Time Division Duplex) systems only turn on in the transmission time slots, which can be realized by the switching control circuits in the bias circuits of the RF PAs. The switching status of the switching control circuit is determined by the envelope detection results of the input RF signals of the RF PA. Therefore, the switching speed of the bias circuits is critical for the performance of the TDD PA. In this paper, the switching characteristics of the bias circuits will be discussed. Then a high speed switching control circuit for Doherty power amplifiers for TD-LTE systems is proposed so as to construct a high quality TDD bias circuit. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed switching control circuit can effectively improve the speed of the switching speed and satisfy the requirements of the RF power amplifiers in a TD-LTE system. © 2012 IEEE.

84886879656	Broadband predistortion circuit using zero bias diodes for radio over fiber systems	A low-cost broadband analog predistortion circuit (PDC) is designed and experimentally verified in a radio over fiber (RoF) system. A miniature hybrid microwave integrated circuit technique is used to reduce the size and parasitics of PDC. Only two zero bias GaAs beam lead detector diodes and capacitors are used in the PDC. The diodes can be biased at {<}{\rm 3}~{\rm mA} due to zero bias characteristic so that power consumption is reduced. No broadband matching network is required because of high series resistance of the zero bias diodes. The linearization performance is evaluated using an RoF system without and with the PDC. It is shown that the PDC improves the input 1-dB compression power by 0.4-2.2 dB from 7 to 18 GHz; and spurious free dynamic ranges are improved by {\sim}{\rm 10}~{\rm dB} from 7 to 14 GHz and {\sim}{\rm 6}~{\rm dB} from 15 to 18 GHz, limited by fifth order nonlinear distortion. © 2013 IEEE.

84888625571	Mach-Zehnder: A review of bias control techniques for mach-zehnder modulators in photonic analog links	The Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) has been widely used for broadband photonic analog links and high-speed digital optical fiber communication systems because it possesses large modulation bandwidth, low driving voltage, and low chirp. The MZM is a very important optical modulator for photonic applications. In an MZM, the input light is split into two paths, each of which is modulated by an electrical signal. Then the two arms are combined to generate an intensity-modulated light or a phase-modulated light at the output of the MZM. An MZM can be made of lithium niobate (LiNbO3), gallium arsenide (GaAs), or indium phosphide (InP), materials that exhibit some anisotropy in their dielectric properties. Theoretically, the relation of output optical field and driving voltage is a cosine function, i.e., nonlinear transfer function. For RF photonics, the MZM has typically two applications: optical harmonic generation for optical frequency multiplication and optical subcarrier modulation for optical signal modulation. For optical frequency multiplication, high transfer-function nonlinearity is preferred. In contrast, high transfer-function linearity is preferred for optical subcarrier modulation. It is well known that a cosine transfer function can present high or low nonlinearity dependent on operation voltage. Specifically, bias voltages determine the degree of nonlinearity or linearity of the MZM transfer function. For optical frequency multiplication such as millimeter-wave generation, the MZM should be biased at some specific bias points, such as minimum transmission, maximum transmission, and quadrature bias points, to enhance nonlinearity [1]?[2]. For optical subcarrier modulation, biasing an MZM in its linear region such as quadrature bias points allows transmitting broadband RF signals with multioctave bandwidth and improves spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). Therefore, care must be taken to maintain and control the MZM bias point for a specific application. © 2013 IEEE.

84892859275	Sub-band separation based digital pre-distortion technique for linearizing concurrent dual-band power amplifiers	A novel sub-band separation concurrent dual-band digital pre-distortion (SSCD-DPD) method suitable for linearizing nonlinear behaviours of concurrent dual-band (CDB) power amplifiers (PAs) is proposed. This method uses novel capture technology to acquire low- and high-frequency sub-bands baseband complex sample data of PAs input and output. The pre-calibration data of each sub-band is got by new digital method. A CDB test signal was used to verify the capability of the SSCD-DPD method in suppressing spectrum re-growth caused by CDB PA nonlinearity. For experimental verification, a high nonlinear 51-dBm peak-power Doherty PA is designed and used. The results indicate that the proposed SSCD-DPD method greatly reduces the analog-to-digital converter (ADCs) and digital-toanalog converters (DACs) sampling rate than the conventional method; this rate depends only on the maximum of both bandwidth of the low- and high-frequency sub-band signals. In the low sampling rate of ADC and DAC, it is nearly to the conventional method in suppressing the spectral re-growth of strongly nonlinear Doherty PA when it is driven by concurrent dual-band signals.

AGFMP model was on the basis of general memory polynomial (GMP), removing a lag and replace even order items by fractional order items to reduce the number of parameters and improve the lianearization ability. The dual-band dual-mode signal (bandwidth up to 25 MHz) and 1000001 CDMA2000 signal were used as test signal, and DPA which designed with the peak power of 51 dBm was utilized as test power amplifier to do the linearize experiment. The experimental results showed that the numbers of the parameters of AGFMP are 30% less than GMP in terms of the strong memory effect and static nonlinear. Moreover, linearization ability of the AGFMP is very close to that of GMP. In addition, it is better than the fractional order memory polynomial for the suppression IMD out of band and in-band.

More importantly, the ARBFNN predistorter represents a significant improvement over the RVTDNN and MP in the suppression of the out-of-band spectral regrowth. In addition, the ARBFNN has a similar linearisation capability as the generalised MP model, but has much better numerical stability. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.

84916638692	Generalized two-box cascaded nonlinear behavioral model for radio frequency power amplifiers with strong memory effects	Accurately modeling the memory effects is critical in modeling and nonlinearity pre-compensation for wideband radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) with strong memory effects. In this paper, the memory effects are divided into two categories: lagging memory effect and leading memory effect, which are defined based on the input samples located after and before the current output samples, separately. Considering the above two types of memory effects, a generalized two-box cascaded (GTBC) nonlinear behavioral model for RF PAs with strong memory effects is proposed: one box for a static nonlinearity block that is used to include the strong static nonlinearities and the other box for a dynamic nonlinearity block which is used to predict the mild dynamic nonlinearities. The modeling accuracy of the proposed model, in terms of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and the memory effect intensity (MEI), is compared to the generalized memory polynomial (GMP), the augmented Hammerstein (AH) and the enhanced Hammerstein (EH) models for a 450-470 MHz Doherty PA with a three-carrier WCMDA input signal and a 895-935 MHz inverse Class-F Doherty PA with a single-carrier FDD-LTE OFDM input signal.
