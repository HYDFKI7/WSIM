8844279977	Mining interesting knowledge from Web-log	Web-log contains a lot of information related with user activities on the Internet. How to mine user browsing interest patterns effectively is an important and challengeable research topic. On the analysis of the present algorithm's advantages and disadvantages, we propose a new concept: support-interest. Its key insight is that visitor will backtrack if they do not find the information where they expect. And the point from where they backtrack is the expected location for the page. We present User Access Matrix and the corresponding algorithm for discovering such expected locations that can handle page caching by the browser. Since the URL-URL matrix is a sparse matrix which can be represented by List of 3-tuples, we can mine user preferred sub-paths from the computation of this matrix. Accordingly, all the sub-paths are merged, and user preferred paths are formed. Experiments showed that it was accurate and scalable. It's suitable for website based application, such as to optimize website's topological structure or to design personalized services.

Examples show that they fuse or classify objects with rough features with fairly good effects while the existed methods based on reals can not solve.

15744386127	Research on routing algorithm and self-configuration in content-based publish-subscribe system	Content-Based publish/subscribe systems have recently received an increasing attention. Efficient routing algorithms and self-configuration are two key issues in the area of large-scale content-based publish/subscribe systems. Although many routing algorithms have been proposed, none of them fully exploits multicast to enhance system performance and save network bandwidth. In addition, the vast majority of currently available publish-subscribe middleware has ignored this self-configuration problem. This paper first proposes a hierarchical system model with multicast clustering. Then a hybrid routing algorithm is presented, which can fully exploit multicast in order to reduce the used network bandwidth. Moreover, a multicast clustering replication protocol and a content-based multicast tree protocol are presented for coping with the node or link failures and rebuilding the event dispatcher trees. Experimental results reveal that the system has better routing efficiency and lower cost, and guarantees the self-configuration characteristic.

15744395344	Mining of classification rule based on immune algorithm	To efficiently mine the classification rule from databases, a novel classification algorithm based on immune algorithm was proposed. The core of the immune classification algorithm is as follows. The rule antecedent is encoded as fixed-length chromosome. The fitness function is calculated according to minor misclassification ratio, simplicity and consistency of rules, and coverage ratio of training examples. A vaccination is accomplished by modifying genes on some bits in accordance with minimal fitness function which serves as prior knowledge. Immune selection is accomplished by testing whether a serious degeneration has happened in the evolutionary process and annealing selection. Meanwhile, a rule pruning procedure based on information gain was designed for improving the comprehensibility of classification rule mined. The algorithm has been compared with RISE and OCEC algorithms with five benchmark datasets from UCI data set repository. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has faster convergence speed, but also can achieve higher prediction accuracy with less number of rules.

15744364425	Web retrieval algorithm based on differential manifold	To further improve the retrieval performance of Web retrieval, an algorithm of Web retrieval based on differential manifold was proposed. The essential idea of the algorithm is as follows. Firstly, Web space was modeled as a manifold, and Web tangent space was simulated using a tangent plane of the manifold. Secondly, geodesic distance between points in the manifold was transformed into Euclidean distance between points in the 2-dimension plane. Finally, distance-based matching was performed only in the neighborhood of a query rather than in the whole document collection so as to the computational complexity of the matching process was reduced. Experimental results show that the algorithm surpasses over Google and IIT 35.24% and 40.93% in average precision respectively, and it is more appropriate for large and heterogeneous Web space than other algorithms.

15744364885	New algorithm for personalized topic distillation and hierarchical exploration	To interpret the procedure of hypertext induced topic search (HITS) based on a semantic relation model, the reason about the topic drift of HITS was found that Web pages are projected to a wrong latent semantic basis. A new algorithm for personalized topic distillation and hierarchical exploration (PTD-HE) was presented to improve the quality of topic distillation. Personalized root set and base set with query expansion was constructed using individual query logs to avoid the topic draft, and applying a hierarchical division algorithm based on min-max principle to explore relative topics of user query, and then using HITS to evaluate and return authority pages of relative topics to end-users. The experimental results on 14 queries show that PTDHE performs better than HITS in topic distillation quality and topic exploration ability. PTDHE reduces topic drift rate by 2% to 66% compared to that of HITS, and discovers several relative topics to queries that have multiple meanings.

1842421859	Secure authentication protocol for hierarchical trusted copyright management based on master/slavery license	To solve the problem of the security and efficiency which exists in traditional software protection approaches, a dynamic master/slavery-based secure authentication protocol supporting multilevel trusted copyright is proposed. A third part certificate authority (CA) is adopted for atomic authorization and forced revocation of a software license dynamically according to the software and hardware identity and their usage status, through which the security, consistency and re-distribution of the copyright can be enhanced. Thus the hierarchical trusted structure is suitable not only for single-client but for multi-client copyright management. During the interaction of the protocol, symmetric and public key cryptography algorithm are used for data encryption and digital signature. The result of the analysis has proved the feasibility, security and integrity of the proposed protocol, and as an extension of EULA, it provides a general scheme for software copyright protection.

18744404794	Rough set clustering algorithm based on entropy and information granularity	Aiming at most existing clustering algorithms that only handle the numeric data or categorical data rather than the mixed data, a clustering algorithm based on entropy and information granularity was proposed by using different granular partitions under the framework of the rough set theory. Using similarity relation and calculating the entropy at each data point, the data point with minimum entropy was selected as a clustering center. The numeric granules structure is formed by aggregating all data points in which the similarity with the chosen clustering center is larger than a threshold Î². It does not need to regulate the entropy value at each data point in the clustering procedure, and saves the computation time. Moreover, the character granules structure is also formed by using indiscernibility relation in rough set. The cluster analysis with mixed attribute data is accomplished by iteratively modifying and agglomerating these two granules structures. The comparison of experimental results shows that the algorithm is effective and feasible. When Î² is 0.8, the maximum 0.96 of the clustering validity of the algorithm can be achieved, which is higher than others under same conditions.

Conclusion: The method of reused-based web services composition observably decreases the period and cost of development and greatly improves the programming efficiency.

21844433460	Rough reduction in fuzzy information systems	Based on rough set theories and fuzzy equivalence relations, a knowledge reduction method and importance degree of attributes under different granular partitions of the object space in fuzzy information systems (FISs) were presented. Two parameters for different level partitions (or similar degree between objects) Î±, Î² are used in these reductions, in which the positive region formula of the decision level set are adopted for relative reduction and importance degree of attributes, and the distributed reduction and the assignment reduction are obtained by using rough membership functions of the horizontal set. These reductions extend the attribute deduction methods in Pawlak information systems (PISs) and provide new tools for knowledge discovery and feature selection in FISs. Moreover, by using equivalence classes under different granules, the discernment attribute matrix and discernment formula of the distributed reduction and the assignment reduction were given, which overcome the inapplicability of classical methods in FISs. Demonstration results show that the attribute subsets having maximum degree of discernment and rule confidence with regard to all attributes can be produced by using these methods in different granular spaces.

The retrieval process is repeated until achieving satisfactory results. Experimental results show that in contrast to the algorithms that only using multi-query data technology and only using positive relevance feedback technology, the proposed algorithm increases the average precision by 42.6% and 23.17%, respectively.

The images are taken by rubbing a pencil over a piece of paper covered over the images and then are scanned into a computer. Due to the nature of the acquiring technique, the acquired images have lots of artifacts caused by the shape and the condition of the engine surface and unevenness of rubbing the pencils by hand.

However, most of the current solutions could not meet the demand of End User License Agreement (EULA) in security and efficiency. In this paper, a new and secure authentication protocol for trusted copyright protection based on dynamic license is proposed to solve the above problem. A third part Certificate Authority (CA) is adopted for an atomic authorization and a forced revocation of software license dynamically according to the software and hardware identity and their usage status. Thus under the control of the dynamic license, the copyright is protected safely and the software entity can be transferred freely without copyright damage and resource leakage. Considering the integrity and security of the dynamic license, symmetric and public key cryptography algorithms are used for data encryption and digital signature respectively, while random verification of coding signature is adopted to resist possible attack and runtime crack. Analysis manifests that the proposed protocol is feasible and secure with a high integrity. It can meet the demand of EULA and provide a new and reliable approach for software copyright management.

In the ontology model two constraint rules are defined to evaluate the performance of SND and experiment results show that the federated retrieval offers a reliable and efficient reproduction with the retrieved results from the independent data sources. Moreover, the figures indicate the time comparisons among multiple data sources and give the contribution of each data source by the returned searching results based on the same query set.

Thus, the VOD (video on demand) system was reduced to an M/M/1 queue and many closed-queues with limited resources N. By analyzing the model, it shows that the available QoS (quality of service) and service with high reliability are related to the number of concurrent multimedia servers N and the number of service instances n provided by a multimedia server in the system. The higher QoS can be obtained by adjusting the ratio of N to n, with which the different high reliability services are achieved. Simulation tests indicate that the coincidence between the theoretical and experimental results of the model is up to 95% under the overload condition. This model can guide the design of multimedia systems effectively.

Due to the limit of the dictionary, the method of the word segmentation called "a domain independent dictionary free lexical acquisition model for Chinese document" was used. In this paper, some key technologies related to the system were discussed, such as extracting the class keywords, classifying methods, and the algorithm of the page value calculating. In the last paragraph, the future works, such as the storing of semi-structure information, and the calculating of the web page's value were mentioned. Â© 2005 IEEE.

33745282434	Experimental study on friction factor and numerical simulation on flow and heat transfer in an alternating elliptical axis tube	This paper focuses on the experimental study on friction factor and the numerical simulation on the periodic fully developed fluid flow and heat transfer in an alternating elliptical axis tube (AEAT). The experimental results show that in the laminar flow regime fRe = 84.7, and the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs at an earlier Reynolds number about 1000. The predicted cycle average Nusselt numbers from the standard k-Îµ model and RNG k-Îµ model are quite close to each other, which are appreciably higher than that of elliptic tube and round tube. Heat transfer performance comparisons are made under identical pumping power constraint, showing the obvious superiority of AEAT over a round tubes. In addition, the complicated multi-longitudinal vortex structure of the flow is detected in detail from the numerical simulation results, which improves the synergy between velocity field and temperature gradient in a large extent, hence, greatly enhancing the convective heat transfer.

33749591881	A model-driven approach for business constraints discovery	Business constraints restrict the enterprise structure, govern the business behavior and contribute to the business goals. Due to stuff turnover and lack of documentation the knowledge of what constraints exist and how they interact are often poorly defined. This can seriously hinder an organization to understand how the business behaves and operates and to seize new opportunities or improve the business performance. A model-driven discovery approach is proposed to help the user to uncover the business constraints from the enterprise documents. This approach proposes a meta-model to describe the ontological constructs of the business constraints enforcing environment, defines a set of formal templates to document the business constraints to facilitate communication, sharing and reuse, gives a verification algorithm to ensure the completeness and validness of the discovered business constraints, defines the interactions among business constraints and finally proposes an elicitation procedure to efficiently guide the business users to discover the business constraints. Moreover, an example is presented to demonstrate the discovery approach of the business constraints and their usage for decision-making. Â© 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

33749635125	A constraint-centered two-layered meta-model for enterprise modeling and analysis	Enterprise model is a representation of the knowledge an organization has about itself and of what it would like this knowledge to be. The changing business environment makes a big challenge for the continuous improvement from as-is to to-be of the enterprise. Business constraints are defined as relationships maintained or enforced in the business structure and process to form the most volatile part of the business requirements. The proposed meta-model for enterprise modeling introduces the business constraints as the key element to make the model responsive to the business changes. It consists of two layers including conceptual layer and specification layer where the former provides a foundation for better communication and the latter provides business constraint language and constraint flow language to accommodate the changes and decrease the model maintaining effort. The meta-model forms a precise business as-is description based on which an Analytic Hierarchy Process based what-if analysis mechanism is proposed to analyze the business alternatives to give recommendations for the to-be design. Examples are presented to demonstrate the validness of the metamodel and its what-if analysis mechanism. Â© 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

34247117852	A robust algorithm for subspace clustering of high-dimensional data	Subspace clustering has been studied extensively and widely since traditional algorithms are ineffective in high-dimensional data spaces. Firstly, they were sensitive to noises, which are inevitable in high-dimensional data spaces; secondly, they were too severely dependent on some distance metrics, which cannot act as virtual indicators as in high-dimensional data spaces; thirdly, they often use a global threshold, but different groups of features behave differently in various dimensional subspaces. Accordingly, traditional clustering algorithms are not suitable in high-dimensional spaces. On the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages inherent to the traditional clustering algorithm, we propose a robust algorithm JPA (Joining-Pruning Algorithm).

The discriminated set is operated by constructing an operator of conditional information entropy, and the excluding order of candidate attributes is calculated as the algorithm is iterated. Meanwhile, the breadth-first search strategy is utilized to make minimal reduction set contain the most important attribute.

It is difficult because the input space of GUI is extremely large due to different permutations of inputs and events. To test GUI needs to run a lot of test cases. Neural networks (NN) were explored to reduce test cases to expose new faults. The main idea is as follows. Firstly, NN was trained by subset of test cases that had executed and their test results. Trained NN could recognize fault patterns that had been exposed. Secondly, from the test suite that hadn't been executed, trained NN was used to select test cases that don't belong to the fault patterns. The test cases selected were more likely to expose new faults in GUI. By the method new faults could be exposed by executing fewer test cases.

Combining with the improved fast Q-learning and semi-supervised Bayesian classifier, a novel focused crawling method being able to make online-incremental adaptive learning was presented. Using the characteristic texts extracted from the retrieved pages, the topic-relevance of the new pages can be evaluated by topic evaluator, and the discounted cumulative reward (the value Q) of the links can be predicted by Q-predictor. The value Q is used to cut off the off-topic links, while the reward generated directly by the on-topic pages will be feedback along the link-chain to update all the value Q of the links. And then the characteristic text is selected as unlabeled trained data samples to incrementally improve the knowledge of the topic-evaluator and the Q-predictor.

In training member network, the proposed method adjusts both the network architecture of the individual networks and the connection weights. So it improves the accuracy of the member neural networks while increasing the diversity among member networks and decreasing the generalization error of network ensemble. The method consists of two parts; constructing the best heterogeneous neural networks (BHNN) and constructing HNNE. The former constructs dynamically many best neural networks based on negative learning; the latter incrementally constructs neural network ensemble (NNE) by using the learned best networks. The whole ensemble process can be completed automatically with the predefined network generalization error and the NNE generalization error without priori knowledge of specifying the network structure. Experiments results with regression and classification problems show that the error rate can be improved by HNNE from 17% to 85%, better than Boosting, Bagging and other network ensemble methods.

10644230242	Artificial immune algorithm for flow-shop scheduling	To efficiently deal with flow-shop scheduling problems, a novel algorithm, artificial immune algorithm is proposed which is inspired by the immune system of human and other mammals to simulate the process of the interaction between antigens, antibodies and lymphocytes. The implement of the artificial immune algorithm on flow-shop problems is as follows. The objective function and the part of inequality constraints serve as antigens and solutions serve as antibodies; the antibodies are encoded as natural number that is consistent with workpiece processing sequence; the fitness function is designed as the inversion of maximal flow time. New antibodies are produced by adopting the partially matched crossover operator and mutation operator permuted by work-pieces sequence. The promotion and suppression of antibodies are adjusted according to antibody concentration that is obtained from the maximal affinity value among antibodies. The proposed algorithm is tested on scheduling problem benchmarks. Experimental results show that immune algorithm is quite flexible with satisfactory results, and requires fewer running time than genetic and simulated anneal algorithms.

10644263281	Knowledge reduction methods in fuzzy objective information systems	Fuzzy objective information systems (FOISs) exist in many applications, and knowledge reduction in them can't be implemented by reduction methods in Pawlak information systems. This paper firstly presents new reduction methods including Î± distribution, Î± maximum distribution, Î± assignment, and rough distribution reductions. It then probes into their properties and the relation between them and the reduction methods on Pawlak information systems. Furthermore, this paper proposes the judgement theorems and discernibility matrixes with respect to these reductions. These reductions extend the corresponding methods in Pawlak information systems and provide a new and low computation complexity way for knowledge discovery and rough-fuzzy rule based fuzzy concept classifiers in fuzzy objective information systems.

10644272708	Research and implementation of network teaching model based on role-assignment-task	In order to cope with the emergence of the multimedia and electronic features in network teaching, the assignment and task were defined and modeled from the ontology perspective in the process of network teaching. The concept of assignment state space was proposed and a network teaching management model, NERAT (network teaching role-assignment-task) model, was built based on these definitions. NERAT has a number of features with regarding students as the teaching centre and with task-driven multi-roles interaction, and provides four layers of teaching feedback strategies, such as role-based personalization feedback, task documents-based learning feedback, teaching feedback and multi-role feedback. The results of the application of OPEN-CLASS system, which is a network teaching management software platfrom developed according to NERAT, show that the model can improve the personalization learning and mutual interaction greatly in the web teaching process.

12844280443	Roughness of Choquet fuzzy integral and information fusion	Based on the analysis of existed fuzzy integral theories, the notions of the Choquet upper and lower fuzzy integral and rough interval numbers' integral form were proposed; the rough properties of Choquet fuzzy integral and an information fusion method based on rough Choquet fuzzy integral were given. The method can properly carry out the selection and fusion of interval number sensors in multi-sensor fusion environment in which various disturbance factors exist. The Choquet upper and lower fuzzy integral is the extended form of the classical Choquet one in a sense of roughness, which can deal with the data sources of rough intervals and objects of information systems. The simulated experiments have validated the effectiveness of the method.

13644284539	Web service-oriented dynamic E-business integration framework	To improve the integration capability and expansibility in web services-based Dynamic E-Business (DEB) application, four kinds of application meta-modes about web service used in DEB environment were pointed out: Consumer-Oriented Web Services for B2C E-Business (COWS), Business-Oriented Web Services for B2B E-Business (BOWS), Wireless Device-Oriented Web Services for Extensive E-Business (DOWS) and System-Oriented Web Services for Collaborative E-Business (SOWS). Furthermore, an integration web services application framework model, i.e. Web Services-oriented Dynamic E-Business Framework (WS-DEBF) model, which was based on a four-layer logic structure with application layer, resource share and information exchange layer, data resource layer and network layer, was investigated. This model provided a dynamic integration mechanism among homogeneous platforms in inner-corporation's close-coupled systems or heterogeneous platforms in inter-corporation's loose-coupled systems. In addition, an integration prototype system based on the WS-DEBF model was developed. Application results show that the WS-DEBF model can greatly improve the integration capability and expansibility and provide an effective support for complex dynamic E-business integration and implementation.
