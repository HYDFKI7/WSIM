84942163212	Attachment and proliferation of fibroblasts and osteoblasts: Effects of uniform micro-groove patterns with different widths	BACKGROUND: The adhesion and proliferation of eukaryotic cells is affected significantly by the microstructure of biocompatible materials. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of microstructure of titanium surfaces on adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts and fibroblasts, and explore topography surfaces for implant. METHODS: Titanium materials with five kinds (100, 50, 20, 10 and 5 μm) of uniform micro-groove surfaces were prepared in 2 μm depth, and smooth titanium plate served as the control group. The roughness of the different titanium sample and surface wettability were detected. The titanium samples of different morphologies were co-cultured with osteoblast MG63 and fibroblasts L929 in vitro. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The surface wettability and surface roughness of micro-grooved titanium groups increased compared with the control group. Effects of different micro-groove surfaces had different effects on the attachment and proliferation of different cells. Uniform micro-groove surfaces generally promoted fibroblast adhesion and osteoblast proliferation (P < 0.05). However, the micro-groove of which scale was similar to cell size had a negative impact on cell behavior.

2342442586	Study on injectable bioactive bone repairing material of nano-hydroxyapatite and polyamide-66 composite	The aim of this study Is to evaluate the injectability, histocompatibility, function and other properties of the injectable bioactive bone repairing material of nano-hydroxyapatite and polyamide-66 (n-HA/PA66) composite. The XRD pattern, the relationship between the injectability and liquid-powder ratio, setting time and liquid-powder ratio, compressive strength and liquid-powder ratio were assessed. The size of the composite is determined to be 70 nm in length and 30-50 nm in width, and the molecular weight of polyamides-66 is 18000. The diameter of pores of the composite is about 200-400 micrometer. To evaluate the histocompatibility and function, 8 male dogs were studied with the injectable n-HA/PA66 composite implanted in the artificial defected alveolus of mandible on only one side to be compared with the intact alveolus on the other side. The specimens were taken at 4,8,12 and 16 months after the implantation. The XRD pattern of the solidified n-HA/PA66 composite is the same as the powdered n-HA/PA66 composite. The healing of the gingiva is well at the implanted areas in all animals. The height of the repaired alveolar bone is obvious higher than that of the blank control. The earlier sign of ossification was histologically observed at 16 weeks after implantation. The injectable n-HA/PA66 composite has good biocompatibility and osteoconductive property. As an injectable material, with good maneuverability, it is useful for repairing irregular bone defects, especially in oral and maxillofacial surgery.

30944463855	Structure and biologic properties of nano-composite scaffold	A method was investigated for preparing bioactive n-HA (nano-hydroxyapatite) and PA66 (Polyamide 66) nano-composite as the scaffold for the hard tissue repair using integrating composite with mold and pore. SEM, XRD, IR and burning test were used to analyze the physical and chemical properties of the scaffold. The results indicate that n-HA particles disperse with nano scale in the composite; there are hydrogen bonding and ligand bonding between HA and PA; the scaffold has three-dimensional pored structure with 450 μm macropores and 0.5∼50 μm micropores. Animal testing shows that there are good histological compatibility and high bioactivity between the porous scaffold and bone. The scaffold is a kind of excellent carriers for bone repair because it produces hone-bonding with host and implant and its different pore sizes are beneficial to the growth of bone tissue, blood vessels and osteocytes.

The outermost layer of the specimens was analyzed by XPS and FI-IR. The depth profile was investigated by the argon-ion sputtering method. The cell culture test was conducted using MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. The cells were inoculated and cultured on the scaffolds. Morphological observation of the cells, MTT test and ALP activity test evaluated the cell attachment, proliferation and activity on the materials. Characteristic peaks in XPS and FT-IR spectra indicated clodronate being immobilized on the surface of the bioceramics. The cell culture test in cell quantity and morphology indicated active proliferation of the cells on the scaffolds. The ALP activity of the cells cultured for 3d and 7d on clodronate-HA bioceramics was slightly higher than that on HA bioceramics, but the difference was not significant. This result indicated that clodronate-HA bioceramics had favorable cytocompatibility to be used as bone scaffold with potential ability to improve osteogenesis.

33750325313	Identification of genetic differences between two clinical isolates of Streptococcus mutans by suppression subtractive hyridization	Streptococcus mutans is generally considered to be the principal aetiological agent for dental caries. Phenotypic variation in strains is often associated with differences in gene content, so the isolation of DNA fragments from these genes or associated regions is illuminating. The S. mutans strains 9-1 and 9-2, which both colonized the same oral cavity, were selected after screening for the possession of suspected virulence traits. Genomic DNA of strain 9-1 was used as the tester, and that of 9-2 was used as the driver. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was applied between the tester and the driver DNAs. The subtractive products were cloned into a pCR2.1 vector. Clone libraries representing sequence differences were obtained. The subtractive fragments that were found specifically in strain 9-1 but not in strain 9-2 were identified by dot blotting and then sequenced. BLASTn and BLASTx sequence homology analyses were subsequently performed. Twenty-seven sequences were found in the genome of strain 9-1 that were not in 9-2. Among them, three revealed no homology to published nucleotide sequences while the remaining sequences showed 81-100% homology to known genes of S. mutans strain UA159. These sequences are involved in competence development, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation, repairing stress damage, transport, carbohydrate catabolism, biochemical synthesis, or unknown functions. Differences exist in the genomes of different S. mutans isolates. SSH is effective in screening for S. mutans strain specific DNA sequences. © 2006 The Authors.

37049030841	Clinical Investigation for Bilateral Cleft Lip Repair: Modified Functional Bilateral Cleft Lip Cheilorrhaphy	Purpose: To obtain better operative results, a modified functional bilateral cleft lip (BCL) cheilorrhaphy was designed and used on 131 BCL patients to evaluate the clinical effectiveness in this clinical investigation. A new surgical method would be provided for BCL patients. Patients and Methods: Based on the experiences and advantages of the commonly used self-longation and elongation surgical methods for BCL repair, a new surgical method was designed for BCL patients. During the operation, this modified functional BCL cheilorrhaphy emphasized the operative design, anatomy and reposition of musculus orbicularis orbis, management of the maxilla, and reparation of vermilion of the lip. This method was used to repair 131 BCL patients, and the conditions and results of errhysis, swelling, and healing of tresis vulnus were observed and evaluated. Results: This modified functional BCL cheilorrhaphy was used successfully from January 2002 to July 2005 on 131 BCL patients. The wounds of all patients with BCL who joined this study healed very well without any hematoma, infection, or wound decohesion. All of the patients showed symmetric peak of Cupid's bow, obvious philtrum notch, full vermilion of the lip, little scarring, and satisfactory contour. During functional activity, bilateral upper lip was symmetric, coordinated, and balanced. Conclusions: The clinical results showed that modified functional BCL cheilorrhaphy may be accepted as a good selective surgical technique for BCL patients, and is worth generalization and application. © 2008 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

33344478157	Surgical repair of hard palate cleft with absorbable membrane: The new surgical technique and its clinical application	This study evaluated a new surgical technique with absorbable membrane to repair hard palate cleft without extensive mobilisation of the mucoperiosteum. From 2001 to 2002, 32 selected patients with complete unilateral clefts underwent this surgical operation. The traditional flap surgical operation was performed at the soft palate, uvula and anterior alveolar cleft. The absorbable membrane was implanted to the hard palate cleft gap to guide the regeneration of the mucoperiosteum. The patients were followed up for 1-6 months after the operation. The speech assessment was carried out 12 months after the operation. Of 32 patients, 30 were successfully operated by this method and no obvious complications occurred. Primary healing on tissue defect of hard palate was obtained in 27 patients and secondary healing in 3 patients. Eighty percent of the 30 patients had good or excellent speech 12 months after the operation. The operation failed in 2 patients. The surgical technique with absorbable membrane to repair hard palate appears to have several valuable advantages including the decreased area of the hard palate involved and favourable outcome for speech in the majority of cases.

84876575897	In vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility evaluation of bulk nanostructured titanium in osteoblast-like cells by quantitative proteomic analysis	Nanostructured titanium prepared by the equal-channel angular pressing route (ECAPed Ti) has shown great promise as an implant material over conventional pure titanium. The aim of this report is to investigate its biological properties, surface performance, and comprehensive biological effects at a molecular level when in contact with cells. Protein expression changes of human osteoblast-like MG-63 in response to polished ECAPed Ti had been profiled by employing stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), using cpTi as control after the same polishing process. It was found that ubiquitin proteasome related processes were predominantly enriched in the over-expressed proteins. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) was apparently up-regulated on the ECAPed Ti surface, which could have contributed to the increase in SOD activity and the decrease in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. These expression changes have relationships with protein degradation, bone formation and resistance to oxidative injury, and they suggest that ECAPed Ti has the potential to further promote osteoblast differentiation. On the other hand, the down-regulated proteins exhibited resistance to platelet adhesion on the ECAPed Ti surface. This study reveals the differential expression of proteins in human osteoblasts induced by nanostructured titanium substrates for the first time. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

84876581555	In situ synthesis and biocompatibility of nano hydroxyapatite on pristine and chitosan functionalized graphene oxide	Motivated by the success of using graphene oxide (GO) as a nanofiller of composites, there is a drive to search for this new kind of carbon material as a reinforcing phase in biocomposites. In the present work, graphene oxide and chitosan (CS) functionalized graphene oxide were introduced as templates to fabricate hydroxyapatite (HA) using a facile solution-based in situ synthesis method, and GO-HA and CS-GO-HA nanocomposites were successfully prepared for the first time. It was found that the spindle like HA nanoparticles with a diameter of about 27 ± 7 nm and a length around 150 ± 25 nm were decorated randomly and strongly on the surface or aggregated at the edges of the pristine and chitosan functionalized GO matrix. Compared with HA, the prepared GO-based HA nanocomposites displayed an increased elastic modulus and hardness. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the prepared nanocomposites was investigated using CCK-8 assay on murine fibroblast L-929 cell line and human osteoblast-like MG-63 cell line, respectively. Both of the nanocomposites exhibited a high cell proliferation rate for L-929 and MG-63, and the CS-GO-HA could provide significantly higher cell viability and alkaline phosphatase activity compared to the GO-HA composite. These findings may provide new prospects for utilizing the GO-based hydroxyapatite biocomposites in bone repair, bone augmentation, as well as coating of biomedical implants and broaden the application of GO sheets in biological areas. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84876673888	Biomimetic synthesis and biocompatibility evaluation of carbonated apatites template-mediated by heparin	Biomimetic synthesis of carbonated apatites with good biocompatibility is a promising strategy for the broadening application of apatites for bone tissue engineering. Most researchers were interested in collagen or gelatin-based templates for synthesis of apatite minerals. Inspired by recent findings about the important role of polysaccharides in bone biomineralization, here we reported that heparin, a mucopolysaccharide, was used to synthesize carbonated apatites in vitro. The results indicated that the Ca/P ratio, carbon content, crystallinity and morphology of the apatites varied depending on the heparin concentration and the initial pH value. The morphology of apatite changed from flake-shaped to needle-shaped, and the degree of crystallinity decreased with the increasing of heparin concentration. Biocompatibility of the apatites was tested by proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity of MC3T3-E1 cells. The results suggested that carbonated apatites synthesized in the presence of heparin were more favorable to the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells compared with traditional method. In summary, the heparin concentration and the initial pH value play a key role in the chemical constitution and morphology, as well as biological properties of apatites. These biocompatible nano-apatite crystals hold great potential to be applied as bioactive materials for bone tissue engineering. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

44249094691	Effect of clodronate on wetting property of hydroxyapatite	Aim: To investigate the changes of wetting property of hydroxyapatite with reshaped surface by clodronate. Methods: The experiment was completed in the State Key Laboratory of Oral Disease (Sichuan University) from July to September in 2007. 1 The hydroxyapatite was made into 48 pieces (10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm) and then randomly divided into experimental group and control group with 24 pieces in each group. Sample in the experimental group was combined with the clodronate to form compound material, while sample in the control group was only cleaned with alcohol and distilled water under ultrasonic wave, and then dried for using. 2 Bovine calf serum solutions at different concentrations of 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% were prepared as wetting agents, each for 10 mL. 3 Contact angles of different concentrations of bovine calf serum solutions on hydroxyapatite and clodronate-hydroxyapatite compound were tested with the contact angle analyzer. And the wetting property of two groups was evaluated. Results: There were significant differences between the two groups with different concentrations of bovine calf serum solutions (P < 0.01), and the contact angle of hydroxyapatite group was higher than that of clodronate-hydroxyapatite group. Conclusion: Clodronate modification of hydroxyapatite will increase wetting property of hydroxyapatite.

The cell culture test and gene expression test were performed and evaluated the effect of clodronate modifying the HA on co-culturing osteoblast with HA scaffold in vitro. Characteristic peaks in XPS and FT-IR spectra indicated clodronate being immobilized on the surface of HA. The cell culture test indicated that the cells actively proliferated on the scaffolds. The results of RT-PCR showed there was no significant difference between two groups in expression of RANKL gene, while the expression of OPG gene showed higher expression in Clodronate-HA group. Clodronate had no obvious effect on the cytocompatibility of HA, and Clodronate-HA might be used as bone scaffold with potential ability to improve osteogenesis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

66349106840	Direct growth of human enamel-like calcium phosphate microstructures on human tooth	Dental Enamel is the hardest mineralized tissue in the human body which is comprised of nanorodlike hydroxyapatite crystals arranged into a highly organized micro-architectural unit called an enamel prism. In this paper the direct growth of human enamel-like structures on human tooth using fluorapatite/phosphoric acid pastes is explored. SEM images show that the newly formed calcium phosphate crystals can be self-assembled into a similar ordered microstructure as those seen in human enamel. The mechanism of how these structures form is discussed. This work demonstrates the potential of applying nanotechnology to regenerate dental enamel clinically without cells.

69049105432	Alkali-heat treatment of a low modulus biomedical Ti-27Nb alloy	This study focuses on the surface modification of a near β-type Ti-27 wt.% Nb alloy by alkali-heat treatment. The influence of alkali concentration, alkali-treated time and alkali-treated temperature on the microstructure and constitutional phases of the modified surface is investigated by SEM, XRD and ICP. Immersion experiments in a simulated body fluid (SBF) were carried out to examine the Ca-P phase forming ability of the modified surfaces. The SEM observation and XRD analysis revealed that a sodium titanate layer is formed after alkali-heat treatment. The morphology and Ca-P phase forming of the layer are greatly affected by the surface roughness of the samples, the alkali concentration, the alkali-treated time and alkali-treated temperature. The results of SBF immersion, which are obtained by ICP analysis, indicate that the activated sodium titanate layer prepared by alkali-heat treatment is beneficial to further improving the biocompatibility of the Ti-27 wt.% Nb alloy. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

74049164095	Enhanced bioactivity of sandblasted and acid-etched titanium surfaces	Two new modified sandblasted and acid etched (SLA) surface methods had been used on commercially pure Ti (Cp-Ti) surface. Scanning electron microscopy investigation showed that modified SLA surfaces had micro- and nano-structure surface topography. Contact angle test showed that surface hydrophilicity was significantly increased after modified SLA surface modification. Human osteoblast-like MG63 cell attachment test showed that modified SLA surfaces would attach more cells than simple SLA surface. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay indicated that ALP activity was enhanced on two modified SLA surfaces relative to SLA and mechanically polished Cp-Ti surface at early stage. Thus, subsequent chemical modification of SLA surface seems to be a promising method to generate better bioactive surface properties.

77956474289	A green fabrication approach of gelatin/CM-chitosan hybrid hydrogel for wound healing	A series of hydrogels were fabricated from an aqueous solution of gelatin and carboxymethyl chitosan (CM-chitosan) by radiation-induced-crosslinking at ambient temperature. Several physicochemical and biological properties of the hydrogels were investigated to evaluate their potential as wound healing materials. By increasing the CM-chitosan content in the hybrid hydrogels, their swelling ability increased significantly, while the compressive modulus decreased. The miscibility between gelatin and CM-chitosan molecules led to a semi-interpenetrate network after crosslinking. Observed by SEM, scaffolds with a homogeneous interconnected pore structure were obtained after lyophilizing the hydrogels. The enzyme degradation rate of the hydrogels was controlled by adjusting the procedure, which could be matched to the healing rate of the wound. Furthermore, the gelatin/CM-chitosan hydrogels promoted cell attachment and rapid growth of fibroblasts on the material. Due to the high water absorption capacity, a similar compressive modulus with soft tissue, controllable biodegradation, and excellent biocompatibility, the gelatin/CM-chitosan hybrid hydrogels have potential as skin scaffolds and wound healing materials. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

78649758090	One-step modification of nano-hydroxyapatite coating on titanium surface by hydrothermal method	Since metallic biomaterials used for orthopedic and dental implants possess a paucity of reactive functional groups, bioactivity modification of these materials is challenging. To enhance osteoconductivity, sandblasted and acid etched titanium (SLA-Ti) discs were hydrothermally treated in simple suspension of hydroxyapatite (HA) by a one-step method in the present work. Change of surface chemistry, surface morphology of samples, and structure of formed nano-HA were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrated that the concentration of hydroxyl groups increased after hydrothermal treatment. The ability of the titanium surface to form nano-HA was enhanced by increasing the hydrothermal treatment temperature and time. The bonding strength of the formed nano-HA coating, examined by an ultrasonic cleaning process, was higher than that of HA coating generated directly by HA suspension deposition. Culturing of MC3T3-E1 cells on the SLA-Ti and HT-Ti discs in vitro showed that HT-Ti was more favorable for cell attachment and differentiation than SLA-Ti. Hence the one-step hydrothermal treatment with HA suspension was a simple, effective and promising method for HA coating modification of titanium implants. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78650290994	Surface bioactivity modification of titanium by CO2 plasma treatment and induction of hydroxyapatite: In vitro and in vivo studies	Since metallic biomaterials used for orthopedic and dental implants possess a paucity of reactive functional groups, bioactivity modification of these materials is challenging. In the present work, the titanium discs and rods were treated with carbon dioxide plasma and then incubated in a modified simulated body fluid 1.5SBF to obtain a hydroxyapatite layer. Surface hydrophilicity of samples, changes of surface chemistry, surface morphologies of samples, and structural analysis of formed hydroxyapatite were investigated by contact angle to water, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrated that hydrophilicity of titanium surface was improved and hydroxyl groups increased after modification with carbon dioxide plasma treatment. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of titanium were the richest after carbon dioxide plasma treatment under the condition of 20 W for less than 30 s. The hydroxyapatite formability of titanium surface was enhanced by carbon dioxide plasma pretreatment, which was attributed to the surface chemistry. MC3T3-E1 cell as a model cell was cultured on the Ti, CPT-Ti and CPT/SBF-Ti discs in vitro, and the results of the morphology and differentiation of the cell showed that CPT/SBF-Ti was the highest bioactive. The relative parameters of the new bone around the Ti and CPT/SBF-Ti rods including bone mineral density (BMD), a ratio of bone volume to total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) and trabecular number (Tb.N.) were analyzed by a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) after 4-, 8- and 12-week implantation periods in vivo. The results indicated that the CPT/SBF-Ti was more advantageous for new bone formation. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

78650775838	In vitro corrosion, cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility of bulk nanocrystalline pure iron	Bulk nanocrystalline pure iron rods were fabricated by the equal channel angular pressure (ECAP) technique up to eight passes. The microstructure and grain size distribution, natural immersion and electrochemical corrosion in simulated body fluid, cellular responses and hemocompatibility were investigated in this study. The results indicate that nanocrystalline pure iron after severe plastic deformation (SPD) would sustain durable span duration and exhibit much stronger corrosion resistance than that of the microcrystalline pure iron. The interaction of different cell lines reveals that the nanocrystalline pure iron stimulates better proliferation of fibroblast cells and preferable promotion of endothelialization, while inhibits effectively the viability of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The burst of red cells and adhesion of the platelets were also substantially suppressed on contact with the nanocrystalline pure iron in blood circulation. A clear size-dependent behavior from the grain nature deduced by the gradual refinement microstructures was given and well-behaved in vitro biocompatibility of nanocrystalline pure iron was concluded. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In this study, PCL/PLAIHA nanofiber mats with different weight ratio were prepared using electrospinning. Their structure and morphology were studied by FTIR and FESEM. FTIR results demonstrated that the HA particles were successfully incorporated into the PCL/PLA nanofibers. The FESEM images showed that the surface of fibers became coarser with the introduction of HA nanoparticles into PCL/PLA system. Furthermore, the addition of HA led to the decreasing of fiber diameter. The average diameters of PCL/PLAIHA nanofiber were in the range of 300-600 nm, while that of PCL/PLA was 776 + 15.4 nm. The effect of nanofiber composition on the osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion and proliferation were investigated as the preliminary biological evaluation of the scaffold. The MC3T3-E1 cell could be attached actively on all the scaffolds. The MiT assay revealed that PCL/PLAJHA scaffold shows significantly higher cell proliferation than PCL/PLA scaffolds. After 15 days of culture, mineral particles on the surface of the cells was appeared on PCL/PLAJHA nanofibers while normal cell spreading morphology on PCL/PLA nanofibers.

Furthermore, murine fibroblast cells were indirectly employed to detect cytotoxicity by co-incubation with the extraction from the given materials. Haemocompatibility, consisting of hemolysis test and adhesion of the platelets, was also measured with fresh human whole blood and platelet-rich plasma respectively. Polarization resistance trials indicate that nanocrystalline 304ss is more corrosion resistant in the Hank's solution, with lower current density and superficial corrosion morphologies. The release values of the biotoxic ions after immersion do not exceed the set limit and turn to be well below the critical value necessary to induce allergy and below daily dietary intake level. Cellular interaction is observed via the proliferated feature of the cell line. Hemolysis and platelet adhesion results elucidates that nanocrystalline 304ss is biological and hematologic compatible.

79952538327	Enhanced in vitro biocompatibility of ultrafine-grained titanium with hierarchical porous surface	Bulk ultrafine-grained Ti (UFG Ti) was successfully fabricated by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) technique in the present study, and to further improve its surface biocompatibility, surface modification techniques including sandblasting, acid etching and alkali treatment were employed to produce a hierarchical porous surface. The effect of the above surface treatments on the surface roughness, wettability, electrochemical corrosion behavior, apatite forming ability and cellular behavior of UFG Ti were systematically investigated with the coarse-grained Ti as control. Results show that UFG-Ti with surface modification had no pitting corrosion and presented low corrosion rate in simulated body fluids (SBF). The hierarchical porous surface yielded by surface modification enhanced the ability of UFG Ti to form a complete apatite layer when soaked in SBF and promoted osteoblast-like cells attachment and proliferation in vitro, which promises to have a significant impact on increasing bone-bonding ability and reducing healing time when implanted due to faster tissue integration. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79953698739	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of SLA titanium surfaces with further alkali or hydrogen peroxide and heat treatment	The present study aimed to evaluate the bioactivity of titanium surfaces sandblasted with large-grit corundum and acid etched (SLA) plus further alkali or hydrogen peroxide and heat treatment for dental implant application. Pure titanium disks were mechanically polished as control surface (Ti-control) and then sandblasted with large-grit corundum and acid etched (SLA). Further chemical modifications were conducted using alkali and heat treatment (ASLA) and hydrogen peroxide and heat treatment (HSLA) alternatively. The surface properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle and roughness measurements. Further evaluation of surface bioactivity was conducted by MC3T3-E1 cell attachment, proliferation, morphology, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition on the sample surfaces. After insertion in the beagle's mandibula for a specific period, cylindrical implant samples underwent micro-CT examination and then histological examination. It was found that ASLA and HSLA surfaces significantly increased the surface wettability and MC3T3-E1 cell attachment percentage, ALP activity and the quality of calcium deposition in comparison with simple SLA and Ti-control surfaces. Animal studies showed good osseointegration of ASLA and HSLA surfaces with host bone. In conclusion, ASLA and HSLA surfaces enhanced the bioactivity of the traditional SLA surface by integrating the advantages of surface topography, composition and wettability. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

79957880164	Nanofibrous scaffold prepared by electrospinning of poly(vinyl alcohol)/gelatin aqueous solutions	A series of nanofibrous scaffolds were prepared by electrospinning of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/gelatin aqueous solution. PVA and gelatin was dissolved in pure water and blended in full range, then being electrospun to prepared nanofibers, followed by being crosslinked with glutaraldehyde vapor and heat treatment to form nanofibrous scaffold. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images of the nanofibers manifested that the fiber average diameters decreased from 290 to 90 nm with the increasing of gelatin. In vitro degradation rates of the nanofibers were also correlated with the composition and physical properties of electrospinning solutions. Cytocompatibility of the scaffolds was evaluated by cells morphology and MTT assay. The FESEM images revealed that NIH 3T3 fibroblasts spread and elongated actively on the scaffolds with spindle-like and star-type shape. The results of cell attachment and proliferation on the nanofibrous scaffolds suggested that the cytotoxicity of all samples are grade 1 or grade 0, indicating that the material had sound biosafety as biomaterials. Compared with pure PVA and gelatin scaffolds, the hybrid ones possess improved biocompatibility and controllability. These results indicate that the PVA/gelatin nanofibrous have potential as skin scaffolds or wound dressing. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79957719028	Comparative study on corrosion resistance and in vitro biocompatibility of bulk nanocrystalline and microcrystalline biomedical 304 stainless steel	Objectives: SUS 304 stainless steels have been widely used in orthodontics and implants such as archwires, brackets, and screws. The purpose of present study was to investigate the biocompatibility of both the commercial microcrystalline biomedical 304 stainless steel (microcrystalline 304ss) and novel-fabricated nanocrystalline 304 stainless steel (nanocrystalline 304ss). Methods: Bulk nanocrystalline 304ss sheets had been successfully prepared by microcrystalline 304ss plates using severe rolling technique. The electrochemical corrosion and ion release behavior immersion in artificial saliva were measured to evaluate the property of biocorrosion in oral environment. The cell lines of murine and human cell lines from oral and endothelial environment were co-cultured with extracts to evaluate the cytotoxicity and provide referential evidence in vivo. Results: The polarization resistance trials indicated that nanocrystalline 304ss is more corrosion resistant than the microcrystalline 304ss in oral-like environment with higher corrosion potential, and the amount of toxic ions released into solution after immersion is lower than that of the microcrystalline 304ss and the daily dietary intake level. The cytotoxicity results also elucidated that nanocrystalline 304ss is biologically compatible in vitro, even better than that of microcrystalline 304ss. Significance: Based on the much higher mechanical and physical performances, nanocrystalline 304ss with enhanced biocorrosion property, well-behaved in vitro cytocompatibility can be a promising alternative in orthodontics and fixation fields in oral cavity. © 2011 Academy of Dental Materials.

The results revealed that the md-AC with 50 wt% MO-CDP could set within 6 min and the compression strength could reach 51 MPa after setting for 1 h, indicating that the md-AC had highly initial mechanical strength. The degradability of the md-AC in Tris-HCl solution increased with the increase of MO-CDP amount, and the weight loss ratio of md-AC with 50 wt% MO-CDP was 57.5 wt% after soaked for 12 weeks.

80053333482	Fibronectin and bone morphogenetic protein-2-decorated poly(OEGMA-r-HEMA) brushes promote osseointegration of titanium surfaces	To be better used as medical implants in orthopedic and dental clinical applications, titanium and titanium-based alloys need to be capable of inducing osteogenesis. Here we describe a method that allows the facile decoration of titanium surfaces to impart an osteogenesis capacity. A Ti surface was first deposited on a poly(OEGMA-r-HEMA) film using surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) with the further step of carboxylation. The modified surfaces were resistant to cell adhesion. Fibronectin (FN) and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) were further immobilized onto p(OEGMA-r-HEMA) matrices. Our results demonstrate that the FN- and rhBMP-2-conjugated polymer surfaces could induce the adhesion of MC3T3 cells on Ti surfaces. Moreover, the protein-tethered surface exhibited enhanced cell differentiation in terms of alkaline phosphatase activity compared to that of the pristine Ti surface at similar cell proliferation rates. This research establishes a simple modification method of Ti surfaces via Ti-thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and SI-ATRP and identifies a dual-functional Ti surface that combines antifouling and osseointegration promotion. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The results showed the viability and actin cytoskeleton of the cells descended with the increase of the concentration of n-HA, and the actin cytoskeleton of cells was depolymerised and became more disordered. Apoptotic rate of cells (1.85, 1.99, and 2.29) increased with the increase of n-HA concentration (5, 15, and 25 μg/mL) and become significantly higher than the control. Total intracellular protein content decreased with n-HA concentration increase, showing significant difference between 25 μg/mL and the control, and no significant change of ALP activity was observed at the 5th day. The results revealed that the cell growth was inhibited by n-HA in a concentration-dependent manner, and the obvious biological effects of MG-63 cells on n-HA existed at the low concentration range from 5 to 25 μg/mL. © 2011 Xiaochen Liu et al.

84855566543	Surface characteristics and corrosion behaviour of WE43 magnesium alloy coated by SiC film	Amorphous SiC film has been successfully fabricated on the surface of WE43 magnesium alloy by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) technique. The microstructure and elemental composition were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The immersion test indicated that SiC film could efficiently slow down the degradation rate of WE43 alloy in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 ± 1 °C. The indirect toxicity experiment was conducted using L929 cell line and the results showed that the extraction medium of SiC coated WE43 alloys exhibited no inhibitory effect on L929 cell growth. The in vitro hemocompatibility of the samples was investigated by hemolysis test and blood platelets adhesion test, and it was found that the hemolysis rate of the coated WE43 alloy decreased greatly, and the platelets attached on the SiC film were slightly activated with a round shape. It could be concluded that SiC film prepared by PECVD made WE43 alloy more appropriate to biomedical application. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ultrasonic treatment on the polymer solutions significantly influenced the distribution of β-TCP particles. An ultrasonic time of 20 min, followed by 30 kGy irradiation induced a crosslinked scaffold with homogeneous distribution of β-TCP particles, interconnected porous structure, sound swelling capacity and mechanical strength. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction analysis indicated that β-TCP successfully incorporated with the network of gelatin and CM-chitosan. In vivo implantation of the scaffold into the mandible of beagle dog revealed that the scaffolds had excellent biocompatibility and the presence of β-TCP can accelerate bone regeneration.

84862203871	Quantitative proteomic analysis of human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells in response to bioinert implant material titanium and polyetheretherketone	Commercially pure titanium (cpTi) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) are widely used surface-modified implant materials in orthopedics and dental therapeutics. However, there still has not been comprehensive biocompatibility evaluation of them at molecular level. By employing stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we profiled the dynamic protein expression changes in human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells cultured on cpTi and PEEK, respectively. About 2000 proteins were quantified and 400 proteins showed substantial alterations in expression levels upon each material treatment. Notably, the extent of alterations diminished as the contact prolonged, which suggested adaptive response to the bioinert materials. Similar patterns of expression changes were observed for both cpTi and PEEK. The representative pathways reflected the regulation of biosynthesis, metabolism and cell adhesion in the adaptive process. In addition, PEEK showed stronger inhibition on mRNA processing, which explained the lower proliferation rate of the cells cultured on PEEK. Our results indicated that the widely used bioinert materials cpTi and PEEK could individually induce a cooperative response involving a wide panel of proteins and pathways. This study has established a basis for better understanding the biocompatibility of surface-modified implant biomaterials at molecular level. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84862315977	Cell responses to two kinds of nanohydroxyapatite with different sizes and crystallinities	Introduction:Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the principal inorganic constituent of human bone. Due to its good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, all kinds of HA particles were prepared by different methods. Numerous reports demonstrated that the properties of HA affected its biological effects. Methods: Two kinds of nanohydroxyapatite with different sizes and crystallinities were obtained via a hydrothermal treatment method under different temperatures. It was found that at a temperature of 140°C, a rod-like crystal (n-HA1) with a diameter of 23 ± 5 nm, a length of 47 ± 14 nm, and crystallinity of 85% ± 5% was produced, while at a temperature of 80°C, a rod- like crystal (n-HA2) with a diameter of 16 ± 3 nm, a length of 40 ± 10 nm, and crystallinity of 65% ± 3% was produced. The influence of nanohydroxyapatite size and crystallinity on osteoblast viability was studied by MTT, scanning electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. Results: n-HA1 gave a better biological response than n-HA2 in promoting cell growth and inhibiting cell apoptosis, and also exhibited much more active cell morphology. Alkaline phosphatase activity for both n-HA2 and n-HA1 was obviously higher than for the control, and no significant difference was found between n-HA1 and n-HA2. The same trend was observed on Western blotting for expression of type I collagen and osteopontin. In addition, it was found by transmission electron microscopy that large quantities of n-HA2 entered into the cell and damaged the cellular morphology. Release of tumor necrosis factor alpha from n-HA2 was markedly higher than from n-HA1, indicating that n-HA2 might trigger a severe inflammatory response. Conclusion: This work indicates that not all nanohydroxyapatite should be considered a good biomaterial in future clinical applications. © 2012 Liu et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84863509773	A facile method for electrospinning of Ag nanoparticles/poly (vinyl alcohol)/carboxymethyl-chitosan nanofibers	A facile method to prepare silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) containing nanofibers via electrospinning has been demonstrated. AgNPs were in situ synthesized in poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/carboxymethyl-chitosan (CM-chitosan) blend aqueous solution before electrospinning. UV-vis spectra, viscosity and conductivity of the electrospinning solution were measured to investigate their effects on the electrospinning procedure. The morphology of AgNPs/PVA/CM- chitosan nanofibers was observed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. The formation and morphology of AgNPs were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The resulted nanofibers have smooth surface and uniform diameters ranging from 295 to 343 nm. The diameters of AgNPs mainly distributed in the range of 4-14 nm, and the electrostatic interaction between AgNPs and fibers was observed. Finally, in vitro Ag release from the nanofibers was measured and the antibacterial behavior of the nanofibers against Escherichia coli was studied by bacterial growth inhibition halos and bactericidal kinetic testing. The AgNPs/PVA/CM-chitosan nanofibers possessed certain antibacterial ability, which makes them capable for antibacterial biomaterials. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84864505294	Effects of organic templates and ph on the morphology of hydroxyapatite synthesized by template-directed process	It is well known that the bioactivity and biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite (HA) are closely related with their crystal morphology and size, so how to synthesize HA crystals with uniform morphology and controllable size suitable for clinic application is of great significance. The methods to synthesize HA crystals are various, but in which, the template-directed synthesis has been generally regarded as an ideal approach to prepare the desirable HA nanocrystals. Therefore, this work aims at synthesizing nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) with specific morphology and size in the presence of templates, such as poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS). The effect of pH values on the function of templates was investigated and it is found that in alkaline solution (the constant pH=10), no matter which template being used, HA crystals with irregular morphology can be obtained and most of the crystal sizes are in the range of 30.0~75.2 nm; nevertheless, if gradually raising the pH value of the solution from 2 to 10, lamella-shape apatite crystals with 353.6~367.7 nm in length and 82.7~105.3 nm in width have emerged in PVA solution, while in sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) solution, strip-like apatite crystals with the length of 373.1~85.1 nm and the width of 7.5~22.4 nm have appeared. Then, these obtained apatite powders were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photo-electronic spectroscopy (XPS), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the results testify that all these powders prepared in different conditions are n-HA crystals with high purity, indicating that the pH value has influenced the morphology of HA crystal markedly, and pH variation helps to the template effectively interact with inorganic crystals, and then regulates the crystal growth. The method used in this study make it possible to gain n-HA particles with high purity, and controllable morphology and size which will have great potential in medical applications. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

84865548206	MilQuant: A free, generic software tool for isobaric tagging-based quantitation	Isobaric tagging techniques such as iTRAQ and TMT are widely used in quantitative proteomics and especially useful for samples that demand in vitro labeling. Due to diversity in choices of MS acquisition approaches, identification algorithms, and relative abundance deduction strategies, researchers are faced with a plethora of possibilities when it comes to data analysis. However, the lack of generic and flexible software tool often makes it cumbersome for researchers to perform the analysis entirely as desired. In this paper, we present MilQuant, mzXML-based isobaric labeling quantitator, a pipeline of freely available programs that supports native acquisition files produced by all mass spectrometer types and collection approaches currently used in isobaric tagging based MS data collection. Moreover, aside from effective normalization and abundance ratio deduction algorithms, MilQuant exports various intermediate results along each step of the pipeline, making it easy for researchers to customize the analysis. The functionality of MilQuant was demonstrated by four distinct datasets from different laboratories. The compatibility and extendibility of MilQuant makes it a generic and flexible tool that can serve as a full solution to data analysis of isobaric tagging-based quantitation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

SEM, XRD, XPS, Vickers microhardness test and mass measurement were performed for the enamels before and after treatment. A layer of enamel-like fluoride substituted hydroxyapatite was observed on the surface of all the samples. After treatment by n-FA pastes with 3 different pH values (pH<1, pH=4.5 and pH=7.5), the Vickers micro-hardness value was respectively changed to 125.9 HV, 252.1 HV and 304.9 HV from 241.3 HV of the artificial enamel erosion, and mass loss was 0.75 mg/mm

The molecular structure of collagen hydrogels and the source of the liquid products were studied. Furthermore, preliminary biological properties of the hydrogels were investigated. The results revealed that crosslinking occurred to form collagen hydrogel and the crosslinking density increased with the increasing of the absorbed dose, and the collagen hydrogels showed enhanced mechanical properties. Meanwhile, collagen underwent radiation degradation and water was squeezed out from hydrogel by contraction of hydrogel, yielding liquid products. Collagen hydrogels induced by c-irradiation maintained the backbone structure of collagen, and tyrosine partially involved in crosslinking. The irradiated collagen hydrogels have higher denatured temperature, can promote fibroblasts proliferation, and their degradation rate in vivo depended on the absorbed dose. The comprehensive results suggested that the collagen hydrogels prepared by radiation crosslinking preserved the triple helical conformation, possessed improved thermal stability and mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility, which is expected to favor its application as biomaterials. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84870447150	In vitro synthesis of bioactive hydroxyapatite using sodium hyaluronate as a template	Being a biocompatible and bioactive material, hyaluronic acid has great potential as a template to regulate the mineralization of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanocrystals in vitro. Our present study investigates the effects of sodium hyaluronate (SH) concentrations and initial pH values on the chemical composition, morphology and biological properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals prepared by the wet chemical approach. All purified products were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray photo-electronic spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This is the first time that bioactive carbonated apatites were synthesized using SH as a template. Biocompatibility of such apatites was gauged by cell vitality and alkaline phosphatase activity of MG-63 cells. The results suggested that carbonated apatites synthesized in the presence of SH were more favorable to the proliferation and differentiation of MG-63 cells compared to conventional apatites. In our study, we also found that SH temporarily stabilizes amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) at the early stage of crystallization. The results imply that the initial pH value and the concentration of SH play a key role in affecting calcium vacancies, carbonate content and morphology of apatite crystals, as well as their effects on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells. These synthesized carbonate-containing apatites are potentially attractive candidates for tissue engineering applications. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

In this study, we report the sequencing of 16 metagenomic samples collected from dental swabs and plaques representing four periodontal states. Insights into the microbial community structure and the metabolic variation associated with periodontal health and disease were obtained. We observed a strong correlation between community structure and disease status, and described a core disease-associated community. A number of functional genes and metabolic pathways including bacterial chemotaxis and glycan biosynthesis were over-represented in the microbiomes of periodontal disease. A significant amount of novel species and genes were identified in the metagenomic assemblies. Our study enriches the understanding of the oral microbiome and sheds light on the contribution of microorganisms to the formation and succession of dental plaques and oral diseases.

Inspired by adhesive proteins in mussels, here we developed a novel bone forming peptide decorated nano-HA material. In this study, nano-HA was coated by one-step pH-induced polymerization of dopamine, and then the peptide was grafted onto polydopamine (pDA) coated nano-HA (HA-pDA) through catechol chemistry. Our results demonstrated that the peptide-conjugated nano-HA crystals could induce the adhesion and proliferation of MG-63 cells. Moreover, the highly alkaline phosphatase activity of the functionalized nano-HA indicated that the grafted peptide could maintain its biological activity after immobilization onto the surface of HA-pDA, especially at the concentration of 100. μg/mL. These modified nano-HA crystals with better bioactivity and osteogenic differentiation hold great potential to be applied as bioactive materials in bone repairing, bone regeneration and bio-implant coating applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84879499719	Stimuli responsive deswelling of radiation synthesized collagen hydrogel in simulated physiological environment	Collagen hydrogels were prepared via radiation crosslinking. The simulated physiological environmental effects related to their biomedical applications on the volume phase transition of collagen hydrogel were studied, that is stimuli response to ions, temperature, and pH. The deswelling behavior of collagen hydrogel depends on the salt concentration, temperature, pH, and the hydrogel preparation procedure. Meanwhile, hydrogel structure related to the volume phase transition was investigated by FTIR, fluorescence spectrum, and HR-MAS NMR. Deswelling in salt solution caused little change on collagen conformation, and a denser network led to more significant tyrosine-derived fluorescence quenching. Hydrogen bonding between hydrated water and collagen polypeptide chain was dissociated and the activity of hydrophobic side chain increased, inducing a higher extent of contraction with the increasing of salt concentration. Moreover, salt solution treatments weakened the electrostatic interactions, side chains interactions, and hydrogen bonding of collagen hydrogel, which reduced the thermal stability of collagen hydrogel. Comparing with cell-free collagen hydrogel contraction, fibroblasts did not aggravate contraction of collagen hydrogel significantly. This study elucidated the deswelling mechanism of radiation crosslinked collagen hydrogel in simulated physiological environment and provides strategies for controlling the stimuli response of collagen hydrogel in biomedical application. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It was found that the crystallinity of n-HA was improved with the gelatin content increasing within the hydrogel. In vitro biocompatibility of the obtained n-HA was characterized by testing cell proliferation and differentiation (alkaline phosphatase activity) of MC3T3-E1 cells.

There is still a need to further improve its anti-coagulation property in clinical practice. In this work, we covalently immobilized heparin onto polysulfone membrane to improve its anti-coagulation performance. Low temperature plasma technique with environmentally friendly nitrogen as the gas source, as well as N-ethyl-N′-[3-dimethylaminopropy] carbodiimide hydrochloride/hydroxy-2,5-dioxopyrolidine-3-sulfonicacid sodium chemistry were utilized to immobilize heparin onto the surface of polysulfone membrane. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, as well as water contact angle results confirmed successful binding of heparin to the membrane surface. Only slight permeability differences were observed between the immobilized surface and the unmodified surface, while the polysulfone membrane had become more hydrophilic after immobilization. The blood coagulation time was greatly prolonged after modification and less platelets adhesion was observed on the heparin immobilized surface. Also, compared with heparin injection doses in clinical, the heparinized process in our work consumed less heparin. Our study suggests that the immobilized heparin has local anti-coagulation effect, while reducing the doses. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

84885056924	Long-term self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells on peptide-decorated poly(OEGMA-co-HEMA) brushes under fully defined conditions	Realization of the full potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) in clinical applications requires the development of well-defined culture conditions for their long-term growth and directed differentiation. This paper describes a novel fully defined synthetic peptide-decorated substrate that supports self-renewal of hiPSC in commercially available xeno-free, chemically defined medium. The Au surface was deposited by a poly(OEGMA-co-HEMA) film, using the surface-initiated polymerization method (SIP) with the further step of carboxylation. The hiPSC generated from umbilical cord mesenchymal cells were successfully cultured for 10 passages on the peptide-tethered poly(OEGMA-co-HEMA) brushes for the first time. Cells maintained their characteristic morphology, proliferation and expressed high levels of markers of pluripotency, similar to the cells cultured on Matrigel™. Moreover, the cell adhesion could be tuned by the pattern and peptide concentration on the substrate. This well-defined, xeno-free and safe substrate, which supports long-term proliferation and self-renewal of hiPSC, will not only help to accelerate the translational perspectives of hiPSC, but also provide a platform to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation via SIP technology. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

84885183292	Influence of radiation crosslinked carboxymethyl-chitosan/gelatin hydrogel on cutaneous wound healing	A series of carboxymethyl chitosan (CM-chitosan) and gelatin hydrogelswere prepared by radiation crosslinking. A pre-clinical study was performed by implantation model and full-thickness cutaneous wound model in Sprague-Dawley rats to preliminarily evaluate the biocompatibility, biodegradability and effects on healing. In the implantation test, as a component of the hydrogels, CM-chitosan showed a positive effect on promoting cell proliferation and neovascularization, while gelatin was efficient to stabilize the structure and prolong the degradation time. To evaluate the function on wound healing, the hydrogels were applied to the relatively large full-thickness cutaneous wounds (Ö3.0 cm). Compared with the control groups, the hydrogel group showed significantly higher percentage of wound closure on days 9, 12 and 15 postoperatively, which was consistent with the significantly thicker granulation tissue on days 3 and 6. All results apparently revealed that the radiation crosslinked CM-chitosan/Gelatin hydrogels could induce granulation tissue formation and accelerate the wound healing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84888780641	In vitro growth of bioactive nanostructured apatites via agar-gelatin hybrid hydrogel	Biomimetic synthesis of bone-like carbonated apatite with good biocompatibility is a promising strategy for the development of novel biomaterials for bone engineering applications. Most research efforts have been focused on only protein-based or only polysaccharide-based template for synthesis of apatite minerals. To understand the cooperative roles gelatin and polysaccharide playing in the biomineralization, agar hydrogel, gelatin and agar-gelatin hybrid hydrogel were respectively introduced as mineralization matrix for the in vitro growth of apatite in the study. It was shown that bundle-like carbonated apatite was successfully prepared in agar-gelatin hybrid hydrogel for the first time, through the interaction between apatite and matrix macromolecule under physiological temperature. Moreover, the in vitro biocompatibility the prepared nanostructured apatite crystals was investigated using CCK-8 assay and alkaline phosphatase activity osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1. Compared with HA synthesized by traditional method, the obtained apatite in agar-gelatin hybrid hydrogel could provide significantly higher cell viability and alkaline phosphatase activity. Through the study, we could better understand the role of gelatin and polysaccharide in bone formation process, and the product is a promising candidate to be used in bone tissue engineering.

84892808226	Graphene oxide/hydroxyapatite composite coatings fabricated by electrophoretic nanotechnology for biological applications	Graphene oxide (GO) was firstly employed as nanoscale reinforcement fillers in hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings by a cathodic electrophoretic deposition process, and GO/HA coatings were fabricated on pure Ti substrate. The transmission electron microscopy observation and particle size analysis of the suspensions indicated that HA nanoparticles were uniformly decorated on GO sheets, forming a large GO/HA particle group. The addition of GO into HA coatings could reduce the surface cracks and increase the coating adhesion strength from 1.55 ± 0.39 MPa (pure HA) to 2.75 ± 0.38 MPa (2 wt.% GO/HA) and 3.3 ± 0.25 MPa (5 wt.% GO/HA), respectively. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies indicated that the GO/HA composite coatings exhibited higher corrosion resistance in comparison with pure HA coatings in simulated body fluid. In addition, superior (around 95% cell viability for 2 wt.% GO/HA) or comparable (80-90% cell viability for 5 wt.% GO/HA) in vitro biocompatibility were observed in comparison with HA coated and uncoated Ti substrate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84893706432	Micro-arc oxidization of a novel Mg-1Ca alloy in three alkaline KF electrolytes: Corrosion resistance and cytotoxicity	A newly-developed Mg-1Ca (wt%) alloy was treated by micro-arc oxidization (MAO) in KF-silicate- (Si coating), KF-phosphate- (P coating) and KF-silicate-phosphate (SiP coating) electrolytes. The microstructure, composition and corrosion resistance of the resultant MAO coatings were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Electrochemical analysis and immersion test in Hanks' solution and MTT assay for in-vitro toxicity against MG63 cells were subsequently carried out. Results showed that all the three MAO coatings contributed to the improvement of corrosion resistance and cytocompatibility of substrate; however, P coating outperformed the two others due to its specific microstructure and composition. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84901427184	Antibiotic-decorated titanium with enhanced antibacterial activity through adhesive polydopamine for dental/bone implant	Implant-associated infections, which are normally induced by microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, practical approaches to prevent implant-associated infections are in great demand. Inspired by adhesive proteins in mussels, here we have developed a novel antibiotic-decorated titanium (Ti) material with enhanced antibacterial activity. In this study, Ti substrate was coated by one-step pH-induced polymerization of dopamine followed by immobilization of the antibiotic cefotaxime sodium (CS) onto the polydopamine-coated Ti through catechol chemistry. Contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of CS grafted on the Ti surface. Our results demonstrated that the antibiotic-grafted Ti substrate showed good biocompatibility and well-behaved haemocompatibility. In addition, the antibiotic-grafted Ti could effectively prevent adhesion and proliferation of Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Streptococcus mutans (Gram-positive). Moreover, the inhibition of biofilm formation on the antibiotic-decorated Ti indicated that the grafted CS could maintain its long-term antibacterial activity. This modified Ti substrate with enhanced antibacterial activity holds great potential as implant material for applications in dental and bone graft substitutes. © 2014 The Author(s).

84902121116	Polyetheretherketone/nano-fluorohydroxyapatite composite with antimicrobial activity and osseointegration properties	Lack of antibacterial activity and binding ability to natural bone tissue has significantly limited polyetheretherketone (PEEK) for many challenging dental implant applications. Here, we have developed a polyetheretherketone/nano-fluorohydroxyapatite (PEEK/nano-FHA) biocomposite with enhanced antibacterial activity and osseointegration through blending method. Smooth and rough surfaces of PEEK/nano-FHA biocomposites were also prepared. Our results showed that invitro initial cell adhesion and proliferation on the nano-FHA reinforced PEEK composite were improved. In addition, higher alkaline phosphatase activity and cell mineralization were also detected in cells cultured on PEEK/nano-FHA biocomposites, especially for rough PEEK/nano-FHA surfaces. More importantly, the as-prepared PEEK/nano-FHA biocomposite could effectively prevent the proliferation and biofilm formation of bacterial. For invivo test, the newly formed bone volume of PEEK/nano-FHA group was higher than that of bare PEEK group based on 3D microcomputed tomography and 2D histomorphometric analysis. These reports demonstrate that the developed PEEK/nano-FHA biocomposite has increased biocompatibility and antibacterial activity invitro, and promoted osseointegration invivo, which suggests that it holds potential to be applied as dental implant material in dental tissue engineering applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84901780236	Bio-inspired microscale topographies on drie defined titanium surface for soft tissue regeneration in implant dentistry	Different patterns on Ti substrate which mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell morphology were designed to study the interaction of fibroblast (L929) and bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis) on the surface in vitro system. Patterned titanium samples were prepared by chlorine DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etch) to obtain expected microstructures. Patterned titanium samples were seeded with L929 and P. gingivalis for a period of 1-4days. It was revealed that the cell adhesion rates were more than doubled with promoted cell proliferation on the ECM-mimicked titanium surfaces. In addition, the bacterial adherence rates were greatly reduced on ECM surface. The bio-inspired titanium interface provides an excellent solution for soft tissue regeneration around the dental abutment.

84903306880	Biological behavior of fibroblast on contractile collagen hydrogel crosslinked by γ-irradiation	Collagen hydrogels exhibited a contractile trend in simulated body fluid. In this study, the internal pore architecture and mechanical properties of collagen hydrogel prepared by radiation crosslinking was evaluated during contraction, and the effect of contractile collagen hydrogels on the biological behavior of fibroblasts were investigated in vitro, such as viability, proliferation, morphology, apoptosis, cycle, and stress fiber. The results showed that accompany with contraction of collagen hydrogel, the pore diameter of the hydrogels decreased and compressive modulus increased. However, fibroblasts can grow on contractile collagen hydrogels. Indeed, collagen hydrogel contracted from circumference to the interior, which retard the spreading of fibroblasts on the dynamic substrate and interrupted the initial attachment of the cell. However, contraction of collagen hydrogel had not only significant influence on the L929 cell proliferation, but also accelerated the apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis showed that contractile collagen hydrogel may promote cell cycle from G

84913594219	Rapidly-deposited polydopamine coating via high temperature and vigorous stirring: Formation, characterization and biofunctional evaluation	Polydopamine (PDA) coating provides a promising approach for immobilization of biomolecules onto almost all kinds of solid substrates. However, the deposition kinetics of PDA coating as a function of temperature and reaction method is not well elucidated. Since dopamine self-polymerization usually takes a long time, therefore, rapid-formation of PDA film becomes imperative for surface modification of biomaterials and medical devices. In the present study, a practical method for preparation of rapidly-deposited PDA coating was developed using a uniquely designed device, and the kinetics of dopamine self-polymerization was investigated by QCM sensor system. It was found that high temperature and vigorous stirring could dramatically speed up the formation of PDA film on QCM chip surface. Surface characterization, BSA binding study, cell viability assay and antibacterial test demonstrates that the polydopamine coating after polymerization for 30 min by our approach exhibits similar properties to those of 24 h counterpart. The method has a great potential for rapiddeposition of polydopamine films to modify biomaterial surfaces.

84920842024	The pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory effects of calprotectin on human periodontal ligament cells e110421	Calprotectin, a heterodimer of S100A8 and S100A9 subunits, is associated with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and cystic fibrosis. Although calprotectin levels are increased significantly in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of periodontitis patients, its effects on periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate calprotectin levels in the GCF of generalized aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients and to investigate the effects of recombinant human calprotectin (rhS100A8/A9) and its subunits (rhS100A8 and rhS100A9) in PDLCs. Both the concentration and amount of crevicular calprotectin were significantly higher in the AgP group compared with healthy controls. In addition, the GCF calprotectin levels were correlated positively with clinical periodontal parameters including bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment loss. rhS100A8/A9 promoted cell apoptosis, whereas rhS100A8 and rhS100A9 individually exerted little effect on apoptosis in PDLCs. rhS100A9 and rhS100A8/A9 increased the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) by promoting the nuclear translocation of p65 in PDLCs, subsequently inducing expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNFa, and COX2. Treatment with an NF-kB inhibitor partially reversed the rhS100A9- and rhS100A8/A9-induced upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. rhS100A9, and not rhS100A8, was mainly responsible for the pro-inflammatory role of calprotectin. Collectively, our results suggest that calprotectin promotes apoptosis and the inflammatory response in PDLCs via rhS100A9. These findings might help identify novel treatments for periodontitis.

84923330280	Trend of telomerase activity change during human iPSC self-renewal and differentiation revealed by a quartz crystal microbalance based assay	Telomerase plays an important role in governing the life span of cells for its capacity to extend telomeres. As high activity of telomerase has been found in stem cells and cancer cells specifically, various methods have been developed for the evaluation of telomerase activity. To overcome the time-consuming procedures and complicated manipulations of existing methods, we developed a novel method named Telomeric Repeat Elongation Assay based on Quartz crystal microbalance (TREAQ) to monitor telomerase activity during the self-renewal and differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). TREAQ results indicated hiPSCs possess invariable telomerase activity for 11 passages on Matrigel and a steady decline of telomerase activity when differentiated for different periods, which is confirmed with existing golden standard method. The pluripotency of hiPSCs during differentiation could be estimated through monitoring telomerase activity and compared with the expression levels of markers of pluripotency gene via quantitative real time PCR. Regular assessment for factors associated with pluripotency or stemness was expensive and requires excessive sample consuming, thus TREAQ could be a promising alternative technology for routine monitoring of telomerase activity and estimate the pluripotency of stem cells.
