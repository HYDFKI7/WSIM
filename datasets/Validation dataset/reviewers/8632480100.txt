18944376919	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma staging by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography	Purpose: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a high rate of neck lymph node and/or distant metastasis. We evaluated the value of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in staging NPC, especially in the detection of distant metastasis. Methods and Materials: A total of 95 patients, including 85 with primary and 10 with recurrent, NPC were enrolled. Dual-phase FDG-PET was used, in addition to the conventional workup. Eighty-one patients without distant metastases underwent repeat studies 3-4 months after initial radical treatment. Results: Of 14 patients with distant metastases, all had lesions detected by FDG-PET, and the conventional workup detected the metastases in only 4. Two patients had false-positive MRI findings for neck node metastasis, but the FDG-PET findings were accurate. Four patients without distant metastases on their initial workup were found to have new lesions on FDG-PET 3-4 months after initial treatment. Patients with advanced node disease had a significantly greater incidence of distant metastases on FDG-PET, especially for N3 disease. Of the 95 patients, the FDG-PET results for distant metastasis were true positive in 14 patients, false positive in 8, and true negative in 73. None of our patients had a false-negative result. For a patient base, the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for distant metastasis was 100% and 90.1% (95% confidence interval 81.5-95.6%), respectively, in this study. The accuracy was 91.6% (95% confidence interval 84.1-96.3%), the positive predictive value was 63.6 (95% confidence interval 40.7-82.8%), and the negative predictive value was 100%. Conclusion: FDG-PET stages N and M disease of NPC more accurately and sensitively than does the conventional workup. Patients with advanced node disease, particularly N3 disease, would benefit the most from FDG-PET. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

20144386704	Identification of differentially expressed genes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC): Overexpression of NPM, CDK1 and NDRG1 and underexpression of CHES1	To identify cellular genes that could potentially serve as predictive molecular markers for human oral cancer, we employed differential display analysis to compare the gene expression profiles between oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and histopathologically normal epithelium tissues. Comparative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm the gene expression in 52 OSCC patients, and a 2-fold difference was defined as over- or underexpression. A total of 7 genes were identified: NPM, CDK1, NDRG1, HMGCR, EF1A, NAC and CHES1. In the cancer tissues, NPM, CDK1 and NDRG1 were significantly overexpressed (an average of 7.6-, 17.2- and 12.9-fold, respectively), and CHES1 was underexpressed (15-fold). The frequencies of the differential expression were 40, 56, 67 and 46%, respectively in NPM, CDK1, NDRG1 and CHES1. In Western blot analysis, the protein expressions of NPM, CDK1 and NDRG1 were also increased in the cancer tissues, consistent with the mRNA expression results. To further evaluate clinicopathological associations in these genes, Pearson chi-square analysis was employed. Levels of CDK1 and NDRG1 were associated with poorly differentiated tumors (p = 0.043 and 0.023), suggesting that these genes participate in the mechanism of tumor transformation. Expressions of CDK1 and NDRG1, and CDK1 and CHES1 were mutually statistically correlated (p = 0.001 and 0.014), indicating that these genes share a very close regulatory relationship or interact synergistically in oncogenesis. In conclusion, we identified 7 genes that are differentially expressed in OSCC, and we provide the first evidence that NPM, CDK1 and NDRG1 are overexpressed and CHES1 is underexpressed in oral cancer. These results serve as a fundamental base for employing these genes in future clinical applications. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0030443095	The role of brachytherapy in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: To present the treatment results and assess the optimal radiation dose and the role of brachytherapy in early stage nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Methods and Materials: One hundred eighty-three patients with Stage I and II (American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System, 1987) NPC completed the planned radiotherapy in our institution from 1979 to 1991. In 133 patients, radiotherapy was given to the nasopharynx by external beam to 64.8-68.4 Gy. Further boost was done by high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for 5-16.5 Gy in one to three fractions. For the remaining 50 patients, a course of external radiotherapy to the nasopharynx for 68.4-72 Gy was given to nasopharynx. Age (>40 or not), sex, neck boost or not, brachytherapy, and irradiation dose were analyzed to determine significant factors that influence the probabilities of local control and actuarial survival. Results: The 5-year disease-specific survival was 85.8% and local control was 83%. Only the brachytherapy and irradiation dose significantly affected the results. The use of the brachytherapy had significant impact on overall survival and local control. Furthermore, we compared the prognostic effect of various radiation dosage among Group I of 50 patients (<72.5 Gy, no brachytherapy, excluding four patients who received brachytherapy), Group II of 71 patients (72.5-75 Gy; one to two fractions of brachytherapy), and Group III of 58 patients (>75 Gy; three fractions of brachytherapy). Five-year disease-specific survival rates of Group I, Group II, and Group III were 77, 95.5, and 82.4%, respectively. Five-year local control rates were: 73.7, 93.9, and 79.5%. We found that the Group II had the best actuarial survival and local control rate (log-rank test, p < 0.05). Most patients receiving brachytherapy encountered foul odor because of nasopharynx crust; 12 of them had palate or sphenoid sinus floor perforation or nasopharynx necrosis. None of the patients without brachytherapy experienced the same complications. Conclusions: The optimal radiotherapy dose to the nasopharynx area in early stage NPC may be within 72.5 to 75 Gy by our treatment protocol. A dose of more than 75 Gy did not have significant local control or survival advantage. The use of brachytherapy to elevate radiation dose had significant local control and survival benefit for early stage NPC patients, but the fractionation size should be decreased to reduce the complications.

0031859932	The prognostic significance of pre- and posttreatment SCC levels in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated by radiotherapy	Purpose: To investigate the prognostic significance of the pre- and posttreatment serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) levels in patients with Stage I-IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix primarily treated by radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: 401 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of cervix primarily treated with radiotherapy (RT) were included in this study. All had preRT, and 249 patients had postRT serum SCC values. The association of pretreatment SCC level with the clinical parameters, including stage, hemoglobin (Hb) level, age, cell differentiation, and lymph node status, was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The prognostic significance of pretreatment SCC level and these clinical parameters were evaluated. The impact of postRT residual induration and SCC levels on survival was analyzed. Results: 1. PreRT SCC level strongly correlated with stage. After controlling for stage, only SCC levels higher than 10 ng/ml were associated with enlarged lymph nodes shown in CT scan. No association of preRT SCC level with other clinical parameters was found. 2. SCC level higher than 10 ng/ml, but not between 2-10 ng/ml, had significant impact on survival in a multivariate analysis. Stage, Hb levels (<10 g/dl) and positive lymph node shown by CT scan were also independent prognostic factors for survival. No significant difference in failure pattern in terms of local and/or distant sites was found in patients with different SCC levels. 3. Patients with residual induration and/or persistently elevated SCC level at 2-3 months after RT had a significantly higher incidence of treatment failure. Persistently elevated SCC level is a stronger predictor for treatment failure than residual induration by pelvic examination, and is associated with a higher incidence of distant metastasis. One third of patients with initial SCC level higher than 10 ng/ml had persistently elevated SCC. Conclusion: Pretreatment SCC levels higher than 10 ng/ml are an independent predictor for poor prognosis in patients included in this study, and can be used as one of the prognostic factors for selection of patients for intensive treatment. Persistently elevated SCC levels after RT is a strong predictor for treatment failure. A combination of clinical pelvic examination and SCC levels provides useful information for the need of further work-up and management.

0031953917	MRI of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with emphasis on relationship to radiotherapy	MRI has been used increasingly in the evaluation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) because of its good tissue contrast and multiplanar capacity. Although there are some controversies in messing skull base invasion and cervical metastatic adenopathy, recent reports demonstrate that MRI is currently better than or as good as CT in defining the extent of NPC. During follow-up of patients with NPC after radiotherapy, MRI is also more effective than CT in demonstrating tumor recurrence and in detecting postradiation complications. However, the difficulty of using MRI to detect early mucosal recurrence and to differentiate postradiation tissue changes from local tumor recurrence should be recognized. This paper reviews the literature regarding MRI of NPC related to radiotherapy, with special emphasis on treatment planning, recurrence assessment, and complication detection.

0032015881	Early Stage Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: Radiotherapy Dose and Time Factors in Tumor Control	Objective: To evaluate radiotherapy dose and length of treatment in the control of early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with a combination of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy Materials & Methods: We reviewed the records of 133 patients with early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage I or II, AJC/UICC staging system) who received definitive radiotherapy in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1979 to 1991. The median follow-up time was 7.1 years with a minimum of 2 years. All patients were treated with megavoltage external radiotherapy to the nasopharynx area (63-72 Gy) followed by high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy (5-16.5 Gy in one to three fractions, spaced 1-2 weeks apart). The median total dose and time of irradiation was 75 Gy (69.8-81.4 Gy) and 11.6 weeks (7.8-20 weeks) respectively. Survival analysis was used to examine the effect of several variables on prognosis. Results: The 5-year rates were 86.4% for local control, 84.7% for disease free survival, 88.5% for actuarial survival and 84.2% for overall survival. The treatment group (combination of time and dose of irradiation) was the most important prognostic factor according to Cox's proportional hazard model. Patients receiving radiation at a total dose of ≤75 Gy completed in <12 weeks showed the best prognosis. Conclusion: Treatment time and total treatment dose are both important factors in treating early stage NPC. Decreasing the total radiation time to <12 weeks and not exceeding a radiation dose of 75 Gy gave the best results.

2442596035	Fluoroscopically guided percutaneous gastrostomy with modified gastropexy and a large-bore balloon-retained catheter in patients with head and neck tumors	Purpose: To report on fluoroscopically guided percutaneous gastrostomy (FPG) using a modified gastropexy technique with the insertion of a large-bore balloon-retained gastrostomy catheter in patients with head and neck tumors. Material and Methods: Thirty-four patients with head and neck tumors underwent a modified gastropexy with two T-fasteners followed by the insertion of a 14-F balloon-retained catheter through a peel-away introducer. The success rate and the complications of the procedures were evaluated at 14 days, 30 days, and 60 days. The complications were classified as: major complications that necessitated intensive and/or surgical treatment; minor complications that could be treated conservatively; and tube-related complications manageable by tube exchange. Results: FPG was technically successful in all cases. There were no major complications, two minor complications where superficial stoma infection was controlled by antibiotics, three minor tube-related complications, all three easily managed by catheter replacement via the original tract. Conclusion: FPG with insertion of a large-bore balloon-retained catheter using a modified gastropexy technique is a safe and effective method that creates a feeding access for patients with head and neck tumors and esophageal obstruction. Minor complications can be managed conservatively. FPG may be a good alternative to surgical or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.

2542562095	Telomerase as an independent prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	Background. Telomerase activity has been found to be associated with many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We examined the association of telomerase activity with the clinical outcome of patients with HNSCC. Methods. A PCR-based enzyme immunoassay method was used to measure telomerase activity in 217 matched (grossly normal and cancerous) tissues from patients with HNSCC. Pearson chi-square test was used to analyze the correlation of telomerase activity with clinicopathologic parameters. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox logistic regression model were used for prognostic analysis. Results. Of the 217 tissues assayed, 4.1% of the normal and 63.3% of the cancer tissues had high levels of telomerase activity. Telomerase activity was shown to be statistically correlated with extracapsule spreading (ECS) of lymph nodes (p =.005) and overall survival (p =.003). On multivariant analysis, overall stage (p = .007), tumor depth (p = .045), and telomerase activity (p = .008) showed independent variables associated with poor survival. Conclusions. Telomerase activity has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in cases of HNSCC. Telomerase may be a potential molecular target for clinical use in prognostication and therapy in cases of the disease. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

28044447188	Oral cancer plasma tumor marker identified with bead-based affinity-fractionated proteomic technology	Background: There is no plasma marker for detecting oral cancer, one of the most frequent cancers worldwide. We developed a bead-based affinity- fractionated proteomic method to discover a novel plasma marker for oral cancer. Methods: Affinity purification of heparinized plasma with magnetic beads and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis were used to screen potential oral cancer markers. We compiled MS protein profiles for 57 patients with oral cancer and compared them with profiles from 29 healthy controls. The spectra were analyzed statistically using flexAnalysis™ and Clin-Prot™ bioinformatic software. In each MS analysis, the peak intensities of interest were normalized with an internal standard (adrenocorticotropic hormone 18-39). For identification, affinity bead-purified plasma protein was subjected to MALDI TOF/TOF analysis followed by Mascot identification of the peptide sequences and a search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database. Results: To optimize MALDI-TOF analysis based on the best discriminator of the cancer and control spectra, copper-chelated beads were used for plasma protein profiling. The within- and between-run CVs for assays were <4% and 7%, respectively. Six markers that differentiated between cancer and control spectra were found, with mean (SD) molecular masses of 2664 (1), 2850 (1), 3250 (1), 7735 (2), 7927 (2), and 9240 (2) Da. The 2664-Da marker, identified as a fragment of the fibrinogen α-chain, had the highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (97%) for cancer. Conclusion: The high specificity and sensitivity of the fibrinogen α-chain fragment suggest that it may be a clinical useful tumor marker. © 2005 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

27644595637	Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) as a transcriptional suppressor of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in oral cancer cells	Telomerase activity is suppressed in normal human somatic tissues but is activated in cancer cells and immortal cell lines. The reverse transcriptase (RT) subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is the key regulator of telomerase activity. The hTERT promoter contains E-box elements and may allow upstream stimulatory factor (USF), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) leucine zipper family proteins, to bind and regulate the expression. In this study, we investigated whether and how USF effect on hTERT. Through luciferase reporter assays, we found that both USF1 and USF2 possess a comparable effect on the inhibition of hTERT expression. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting (IB) analysis reveal that the suppression of hTERT by USF was not through the interaction of USF with c-myc or mad, nor disturbed the cellular protein levels of those. In gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assays, we found that the USF suppression is through direct binding at the E-box site of hTERT promoter and rendering the effect actively. Analysis on clinical normal and tumor tissues reveal that the expression of USF1 and USF2 was lower in the tumor tissues, correlated with hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Taking together, our results demonstrate that USF is a negative transcriptional repressor for hTERT in oral cancer cells. It is possible that USF lose the inhibitory effect on hTERT expression leading to telomerase reactivation and oral carcinogenesis. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

27744449474	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma with cranial nerve palsy: The importance of MRI for radiotherapy	Purpose: To evaluate various prognostic factors and the impact of imaging modalities on tumor control in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) with cranial nerve (CN) palsy. Material and Methods: Between September 1979 and December 2000, 330 NPC patients with CN palsy received radical radiotherapy (RT) by the conventional opposing technique at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou. Imaging methods used varied over that period, and included conventional tomography (Tm) for 47 patients, computerized tomography (CT) for 195 patients, and magnetic resonance image (MRI) for 88 patients. Upper CN (II-VI) palsy was found in 268 patients, lower CN (IX-XII) in 13, and 49 patients had both. The most commonly involved CN were V or VI or both (23%, 12%, and 16%, respectively). All patients had good performance status (World Health Organization <2). The median external RT dose was 70.2 Gy (range, 63-77.5 Gy). Brachytherapy was also given to 156 patients in addition to external RT, delivered by the remote after-loading, high-dose-rate technique. A total of 139 patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy, in 115 received as neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and in 24 concomitant with RT. Recovery from CN palsy occurred in 171 patients during or after radiotherapy. Patients who died without a specific cause identified were regarded as having died with persistent disease. Results: The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival was 47.1%, 34.4%, and 22.2%. The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 50.4%, 37.8%, and 25.9%. The 5-year DSS for patients staged with MRI, CT, and Tm were 46.9%, 36.7%, and 21.9%, respectively (p = 0.016). The difference between MRI and CT was significant (p = 0.015). The 3-year and 5-year local control rates were 62% and 53%, respectively. The 5-year local control was 68.2% if excluding patients who died without a specific cause. Patients who had an MRI had a significantly better tumor control rate than those evaluated with CT or Tm, with a 15-30% improvement in local tumor control and survival. Patients with extensive CN palsy had worse survival than those with only lower CN or upper CN involvement (5-year DSS 20.4% vs. 43.2% and 40.4%, respectively; p < 0.001). Patients who recovered from CN palsy had better survival than those who did not (47% vs. 26%, p < 0.001). Brachytherapy was associated with poorer local control, whereas a total external dose of more than 70 Gy improved local tumor control and marginally improved DSS. Subgroup analysis in CT and MRI patients group, either DSS or OS was significantly associated with imaging modality, N stage, or location of or remission of CN palsy. Conclusion: The use of MRI was associated with improved tumor control and survival of patients with NPC causing CN palsy. Patients recovering from CN palsy had better survival. A higher radiation dose delivered by external beam may achieve better tumor control than brachytherapy. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

33645304018	hTERT phosphorylation by PKC is essential for telomerase holoprotein integrity and enzyme activity in head neck cancer cells	Telomerase activity is suppressed in normal somatic tissues but is activated in most cancer cells. We have previously found that all six telomerase subunit proteins, including hTERT and hsp90 are needed for full enzyme activity. Telomerase activity has been reported to be upregulated by protein kinase C (PKC), but the mechanism is not clear. In this study, we examined how PKC regulates telomerase activity in head and neck cancer cells. PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIS), inhibited telomerase activity but had no effect on the expressions of telomerase core subunits. RNA interference (RNAi) and in vitro phosphorylation studies revealed that PKC isoforms α, β, δ, ε, ζ specifically involved in telomerase regulation, and the phosphorylation target was on hTERT. Treatment with the hsp-90 inhibitor novobiocin dissociated hsp90 and hTERT as revealed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis and reduced telomerase activity. Treatment with the PKC activator SC-10 restored the association of hsp90 and hTERT and reactivate telomerase, suggesting that hTERT phosphorylation by PKC is essential for telomerase holoenzyme integrity and function. Analysis on clinical normal and tumour tissues reveal that the expressions of PKC α, β, δ, ε, ζ were higher in the tumour tissues, correlated with telomerase activity. Disruption of PKC phosphorylation by BIS significantly increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin. In conclusion, PKC isoenzyrnes α, β, δ, ε, ζ regulate telomerase activity in head and neck cancer cells by phosphorylating hTERT. This phosphorylation is essential for telomerase holoenzyme assembly, leading to telomerase activation and oncogenesis. Manipulation of telomerase activity by PKC inhibitors is worth exploring as an adjuvant therapeutic approach. © 2006 Cancer Research UK.

33745844231	Higher distant failure in young age tongue cancer patients	The objective of this study was to understand if the age of the patient at onset of tongue cancer was an adverse factor for patient survival and distant metastasis (DM). Data were collected from a retrospective database (January 1996-June 2003, n = 296). Local control rates, neck control rates, DM rates, and survival curves were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic variables were assessed by the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression method. For the young group (≤40 years, n = 76), a significantly higher 5-year DM rate (p = 0.014) was noted than the elderly group (>40 years, n = 220). No significant differences were seen in 5-year local and neck controls, disease-free, disease-specific and overall survivals between these two groups. We concluded that being ≤40 years of age at the onset of disease is a significant adverse factor for DM in tongue cancer. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33745852437	Good tumor control and survivals of squamous cell carcinoma of buccal mucosa treated with radical surgery with or without neck dissection in Taiwan	The aim was to analyze the survival and prognostic factors in 232 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa (BSCC) treated with radical surgery with or without neck dissection (ND). The 5-year survivals for local, locoregional control, overall, disease-free, and disease-specific were demonstrated. Pathologic nodal status was the independent risk factor for local and locoregional control. Both pathologic nodal status and cell differentiation were the significant prognostic factors of disease-free survival. For cT1N0, 11.1% had neck metastases. All were tumor depth of ≧6 mm. Our result showed a relatively better tumor control and survivals in BSCC with radical surgery with or without ND. The possible reason may be due to the benefit from widely surgical resection with ND and post-operative radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy in those with risk factors. In treating early cT1N0, we suggest that elective ND is indicated only when tumor depth ≧6 mm. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33745873554	Surgical outcome of T4a and resected T4b oral cavity cancer	BACKGROUND. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2002 staging system (AJCC 2002) suggested that squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC) with T4b is unresectable. The current retrospective results show that selected T4b patients were resectable with favorable outcomes. METHODS. From January 1996 to December 2000, 103 consecutive untreated T4 OSCC patients (reclassified by AJCC 2002) without carotid artery encasement and skull base extension were eligible for radical treatment. All received head-and-neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) scans before operation. The surgical principles were safety margins of ≥1 cm for primary tumors, modified/radical neck dissections for clinical lymph node-positive disease, and supraomohyoid neck dissection for lymph node-negative disease. In all, 95.1% of patients (98 of 103 patients) underwent free-flap reconstructions. Adjuvant radiotherapy or concomitant chemoradiotherapy was administed to those with pathological T4 (AJCC 1997), cervical lymph node metastasis, or close margins (≤4 mm). Survivals were calculated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier. RESULTS. In all, 58 patients were classified as having T4a disease and 45 were classified as having T4b disease. No statistical difference was observed in the 5-year local control, neck control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates between the T4a and T4b groups. In multivariate analyses, pathologic lymph node status (pN0-1 vs. pN2) was found to be the sole independent predictor for T4b for local control (P = .012), disease-free survival (P = .005), and overall survival (P =.008). CONCLUSIONS. Selected T4b OSCC patients were found to be resectable with outcomes that were comparable to those of T4a OSCC patients and may benefit from radical surgery, free-flap reconstruction, and adjuvant therapy. A pathologic lymph node status of ≥2 was found to be the sole independent predictor for T4b disease in local control and survival. © 2006 American Cancer Society.

33751520049	Increase diagnostic efficacy by combined use of fingerprint markers in mass spectrometry-Plasma peptidomes from nasopharyngeal cancer patients for example	Objectives: There is no plasma marker for detecting nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). We developed a bead-based affinity fractionated proteomic method to search potential plasma markers for NPC. Design and methods: Affinity purification of heparinized plasma with Cu-chelated beads and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis were used to screen potential NPC markers. We compiled MS protein profiles for 47 patients with NPC and compared them to profiles from 28 healthy controls. The spectra were statistically analyzed using flexAnalysis™ and ClinProt™ bioinformatics software. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated by determination of the assay sensitivity and specificity of each marker. Results: Twelve mass fingerprint markers differing between cancer and control spectra were found. The sensitivities of these NPC markers are various ranging from 36% to 83%, and the specificities were all over 90%. Combine use of these markers significantly increases diagnostic efficacy. In which, the combined markers (2020 Da and 4635 Da) possess best discriminator with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (93%). We further identify a C3 fragment, C3f, that may serve as a biomarker for NPC. Conclusion: The combined use of mass fingerprint markers in plasma proteome will enhance diagnostic efficacy for NPC. This method can be applied to search for novel plasma markers for cancers. © 2006 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

33846233817	Combined-modality treatment for advanced oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma	Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors in advanced-stage oral tongue cancer treated with postoperative adjuvant therapy and to identify indications for adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 201 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue managed between January 1995 and November 2002. All had undergone wide excision and neck dissection plus adjuvant radiotherapy or CCRT. Based on postoperative staging, 123 (61.2%) patients had Stage IV and 78 (38.8%) had Stage III disease. All patients were followed for at least 18 months after completion of radiotherapy or until death. The median follow-up was 40.4 months for surviving patients. The median dose of radiotherapy was 64.8 Gy (range, 58.8-72.8 Gy). Cisplatin-based regimens were used for chemotherapy. Results: The 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 48% and 50.8%, respectively. Stage, multiple nodal metastases, differentiation, and extracapsular spread (ECS) significantly affected disease-specific survival on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, multiple nodal metastases, differentiation, ECS, and CCRT were independent prognostic factors. If ECS was present, only CCRT significantly improved survival (3-year RFS with ECS and with CCRT = 48.2% vs. without CCRT = 15%, p = 0.038). In the presence of other poor prognostic factors, results of the two treatment strategies did not significantly differ. Conclusions: Based on this study, ECS appears to be an absolute indication for adjuvant CCRT. CCRT can not be shown to be statistically better than radiotherapy alone in this retrospective series when ECS is not present. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33846309616	DSG3 is overexpressed in head neck cancer and is a potential molecular target for inhibition of oncogenesis	To identify genes that could potentially serve as molecular therapeutic markers for human head and neck cancer (HNC), we employed differential display analysis to compare the gene expression profiles between HNC and histopathologically normal epithelial tissues. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, desmoglein 3 (DSG3) was identified as being differentially expressed at both the RNA and protein levels. Of 56 patients assayed, 34 (61%) had overexpression of DSG3, which correlated statistically with T stage (P = 0.009), N stage (P = 0.047), overall stage (P = 0.011), tumor depth (P = 0.009) and extracapsular spread in lymph nodes (P = 0.044), suggesting that DSG3 participates in carcinogenesis of HNC. Consistent with the clinical findings, inhibition of DSG3 by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly reduced cell growth and colony formation to 57-21% in three HNC cell lines. Use of an in vitro wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, we found that cell migration and invasive ability were also inhibited to 30-48% in three cell lines tested. An in vivo xenograft study showed that administration of DSG3-RNAi plasmid significantly inhibited tumor growth for 2 months in BALB/C nude mice. In conclusion, DSG3 is identified overexpressed in HNC, with the degree of overexpression associated with clinicopathologic features of the tumor. Inhibition of DSG3 significantly suppresses carcinogenic potential in cellular and in vivo animal studies. These findings suggest that DSG3 is a potential molecular target in the development of adjuvant therapy for HNC. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

34147104391	Postirradiation sinus mucosa disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to determine the incidence, progression, and risk factors for postirradiation sinus mucosa diseases (SMD) incidentally found on follow-up magnetic resonance images (MRIs) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS: The medical records, pre- and postradiotherapy (RT) MRIs were reviewed in NPC patients. Lund-Mackay system for staging of rhinosinusitis (Lund score) was used as a tool for investigation. RESULTS: One hundred twelve NPC patients (77 males and 35 females) were recruited in this study. The distribution of tumor staging in these patients were 39 (34.8%) patients in T1, 23(20.5%) in T2, 31(27.7%) in T3, and 19 (17.0%) in T4 by MRI staging before RT. In these 62 patients with normal sinus ventilation before RT, 42 (67.7%) patients returned to having SMDs 3 months after RT. The maxillary, anterior ethmoid, and posterior ethmoid sinuses were most readily affected. In patients with SMDs at 3 months postRT, advanced tumor stage (P = .013) and smoking habit (P = .047) were the two factors that significantly influence Lund score. When comparing Lund score with different times after radiation therapy, a trend of decrease in Lund score could be noted from 3 months to 3 years after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and severity of SMD was found to be highest at 3 months postRT and decreased gradually with time. Conservative management with clinical symptom correlation should be attempted first in these patients. In these NPC patients, advanced tumor stage and smoking habit would predispose them to SMD development. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

34547842093	Health-Related Quality of Life and Patient Satisfaction After Treatment for Breast Cancer in Northern Taiwan	Purpose: To evaluate health-related quality of life (QoL) and attitudes toward surgical procedures for breast cancer among patients in northern Taiwan. Methods and Materials: Two hundred twenty posttreatment breast cancer patients completed a QoL survey at two different hospitals in northern Taiwan. Patients (median age, 49 years; range, 32-69 years) had either undergone mastectomy (n = 157) or breast conservation treatment (BCT) (n = 63). The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Breast questionnaire was used to assess QoL. The patients were also asked about breast reconstruction or use of an artificial breast or not, as well as the decision-making process. Result: There was no significant difference in QoL between patients treated with BCT or mastectomy. Significantly more mastectomy patients had had breast reconstruction or wore an artificial breast (49.7% vs. 3.2%; p < 0.001). Of those who had BCT, 81% would make the same choice again, compared with only 49% of mastectomy patients (p < 0.001). Only 7.6% of patients who made the treatment decision themselves were dissatisfied with their treatment, compared with 25% for whom the decision was made by someone else (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Taiwanese women with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy did not report a worse QoL than those who received BCT, but they were more likely to be concerned about their resulting body image. Half would have chosen a less extensive procedure if they had it to do over. Women were more likely to be satisfied with the results of their treatment if they had decided themselves. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34547913794	Survival of second and multiple primary tumors in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma in the betel quid chewing area	We report the incidence, risk factor(s), and overall survival (OS) of second/multiple primary tumors (SPTs/MPTs) in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients in betel quid chewing areas. Of 816 untreated OSCC patients who had radical surgery, 15.7% had either synchronous or metachronous SPTs. The SPTs (70.3%) were at the oral cavity. SPTs (18.8%) developed third primary tumors, with a significantly higher incidence in synchromous than metachronous SPTs (p = 0.001). An optimal, but significantly lower, 5-year OS was observed in patients with SPTs/MPTs than without (54.0% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.0195). By multivariate analyses, OSCC sub-sites (p = 0.006) and lymphatic permeation (p = 0.040) were independent risk factors for SPT rate. A significantly higher 5-year OS was observed in SPT patients receiving a second radical surgery at the oral cavity/soft palate than patients that did not (p = 0.0001). A good survival rate can be obtained for OSCC patients with resectable SPTs/MPTs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34548067637	Differentially expressed genes in radioresistant nasopharyngeal cancer cells: gp96 and GDF15	Radiotherapy is the major treatment modality for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), but in some cases, the disease is radioresistant. We designed this study to identify genes that may be involved in this resistance. We first established two radioresistant subclone cell lines derived from NPC parental cell lines (NPC-076 and NPC-BM1) by treating the cells with four rounds of sublethal ionizing radiation. cDNA microarray analysis was then done, comparing the two resistant cell lines with their corresponding parental cell lines. Seven genes were found to be up-regulated in radioresistant subclones, including gp96 and GDF15, which had shown highest overexpressions. We constructed small interfering RNA plasmids (gp96si and GDF15si) and transfected them into NPC cells to knock down these genes and examine whether this changed their response to radiation. Both gp96si and GDF15si transfectants had radiation-induced growth delay and reduction in colonogenic survival compared with control cells. Knockdown of either gp96 or GDF15 increased the proportion of the cells in G

34548666971	Intractable bleeding from solitary mandibular metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasizes to the mandible is infrequently seen. Solitary bony metastasis to the mandible is rarer. The intractable bleeding caused by rupture of the metastatic HCC is challenging to clinicians. We present a case of a 74-year-old woman with HCC under control without progression for 3 years. Left facial swelling and episodes of bleeding developed recently and biopsy revealed a metastatic HCC. Computer tomography showed a large tumor in parapharyngeal space with evident mandibular ramus destruction. Bleeding occurred from the metastatic tumor but could not be controlled by electrocauterization, Surgicel™, tissue glue, and bone wax and angiographic embolization. Palliative radiotherapy (2400 cGy in 6 fractions) was tried and the intractable bleeding was successfully stopped after the radiotherapy. Because of the hypervascular and osteolytic nature of the solitary mandibular metastatic lesion, the bleeding was troublesome. Radiotherapy provided successful control of intractable bleeding from the metastatic tumor. © 2007 WJG. All rights reserved.

34648827375	Analysis of risk factors for distant metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity	BACKGROUND. The number of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is increasing. Because the characteristics of patients with OSCC who develop distant metastases (DM) remain uncertain, the authors analyzed potential risk factors. METHODS. For this report, the authors retrospectively reviewed data from 889 consecutive patients with OSCC who underwent radical surgery from January 1996 to November 2004. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether they had either achieved locoregional control (Group A; n = 678 patients) or developed a locoregional recurrence (Group B; n = 211 patients). Cox proportional-hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of the 5-year DM rate. RESULTS. In the entire study cohort, the 5-year DM rate was 9.6% (6.6% for Group A and 21.4% for Group B). In Group A, the number of positive lymph nodes (≥5; P = .009) and the presence of extracapsular spread (ECS) (P < .001) were independent risk factors for DM. In Group B, the presence of ECS (P = .008), poor differentiation (P = .040), pathological stage ≥III (P = .036), and the presence of neck recurrence (P = .001) were independent prognosticators. CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that different risk factor categories according to locoregional control may be used to facilitate the selection of appropriate management for patients with OSCC after they undergo radical surgery. © 2007 American Cancer Society.

37449011788	Salvage therapy in relapsed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity: How and when?	BACKGROUND. Relapse of tumors in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is associated with a poor prognosis. In addition, salvage therapy may be a significant source of morbidity in patients with relapsing OSCC. The objective of the current study was to determine prognostic factors that predict which patients may benefit from such treatment. METHODS. From 953 patients who underwent primary radical surgery between 1996 and 2005, 272 patients with early-relapsed OSCC (n = 161) or late-relapsed OSCC (n = 111) were identified. The optimum cutoff point for relapse was chosen on the basis of 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS. The optimal cutoff value for relapse was 10 months. Late relapses were associated with a better prognosis than relapses that occurred within the first 10 months (P < .0001 for both 5-year DSS and 5-year OS). Among patients with early-relapsed OSCC, a primary tumor depth <10 mm was associated significantly and independently with a better 5-year DSS (P = .014) and OS (P = .011). Among patients with late-relapsed OSCC, neck recurrence was a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes (P < .001 for both 5-year DSS and 5-year OS). CONCLUSIONS. A late relapse was associated with better survival than a relapse that occurred within the first 10 months. Patients with late-relapsed OSCC may benefit from salvage therapy, especially those who have a local recurrence. Among patients with early-relapsed OSCC, salvage therapy should be considered for those who have a primary tumor depth <10 mm. © 2007 American Cancer Society.

37549005561	High incidence of malignant transformation of laryngeal papilloma in Taiwan	OBJECTIVES: Papillomas of the larynx include solitary laryngeal papilloma and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. This study investigated the incidence of malignant transformation and assessed possible risk factors for laryngeal papillomas. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal study. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive laryngeal papilloma patients were prospectively studied for 5 or more years, and each patient was periodically examined at 3 to 6 month intervals. A detailed epidemiologic questionnaire was administered at the initial visit. After enrollment, tissue obtained during each laryngeal surgery was examined by polymerase chain reaction assay for human papilloma virus (HPV) and typing. RESULTS: During 237 person-years of follow-up, six new, pathologically confirmed cases of laryngeal carcinoma were ascertained (incidence 2.5/100 person-years), and all were associated with HPV-6 or HPV-11. Malignant transformation revealed no correlation with the following: age less than 3 years at diagnosis, sex, history of tobacco use, history of alcohol consumption, family history of laryngeal cancer, or type of laryngeal papilloma. Laryngeal papilloma without demonstrable HPV DNA was the only significant risk factor for malignant transformation (P < .05). The cumulative risk of malignant transformation in subjects without demonstrable HPV DNA was significantly higher than that in HPV-positive patients (relative risk, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-60.3; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high incidence of malignant transformation of laryngeal papilloma was noted in Taiwanese patients. Patients without demonstrable HPV DNA require more frequent follow-up and may benefit from anti-HPV vaccinations. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

0033035794	Postoperative radiotherapy of adult supratentorial high-grade astrocytoma	To find the prognostic factors of high grade glioma patients treated by postoperative radiotherapy. From 1979 through 1988, 79 patients with proven supratentorial high-grade astrocytoma completed external beam irradiation at Chang Chung Memorial Hospital following surgery, including by total removal (27 patients); subtotal removal (32 patients) or biopsy only (20 patients). Thirty-one patients and 48 (60.8%) patients had Kernohan grade III tumors and Glioblastoma multiform, respectively. There were 56 male (70.9%) and 23 female patients. Median age at time of diagnosis was 40 years (range, 15 to 69 years). The patients were subject to univariate and multivariate analyses according to age, sex, Kernohan grading, extent of surgery, treatment modality, and irradiation dose. Overall 2-year survival was 15% and median survival was 46 weeks. Improved survival were much more likely in patients younger than 40 years (p=0.016), with Kernohan grade III tumors (p=0.002), and those who underwent surgical excision (p=0.001). Multiple daily fractionation (30 patients) did not lengthen patient survival when compared with conventional radiotherapy (49 patients). For the 49 patients treated with conventional radiotherapy, the dose appeared to be associated with lengthened survival (p=0.037). Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model for the 49 patients treated using conventional therapy showed Kernohan grade, extent of surgery, and irradiation dose were independent prognostic factors. Tumor pathological grade, extent of surgery and radiation dose were important prognostic factors in patients with high-grade astrocytoma. More extensive surgery and higher postoperative radiation dose lengthened the survival in patients with high-grade astrocytoma.

0032744193	MRI in recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma	In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the MRI features of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in 72 patients who underwent MRI before add after gadolinium injection. Recurrent NPC exhibited a high degree of regional spread and a variety of signal intensities and contours. MRI showed a nasopharyngeal mass in 50 patients (69.4%); other sites of involvement included the parapharyngeal space (44.4%), nasal cavity (12.5%), paranasal sinuses (27.8%), oropharynx (4.2%), orbit (8.3%), infratemporal fossa (18.1%), skull base (59.8%), intracranial area (51.4%) and regional lymph nodes (15.3%). On T2-weighted images, the nasopharyngeal mass gave high signal in 9 of 50 cases (18%), intermediate in 27 (54%), mixed in 8 (16%) and low signal in 6 (12%). Contrast enhancement was strong in 12 cases (24%), moderate in 29 (58%) and heterogeneous in 9 (18%). The lesion was convex in 31 cases (62%) and concave or straight in 19 (38%). Recognition of the distribution and the appearance of recurrent NPC on MRI is essential for timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

0032801367	The prognostic factors for patients with early cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy and postoperative radiotherapy	Purpose. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative radiotherapy (post-OP RT) and to investigate the prognostic factors for early-stage cervical cancer patients who were treated by radical surgery, and the pathological findings suggested a relatively high risk of relapse with surgery alone. Materials and methods. From January 1990 to December 1995, 222 patients with stage IB-IIA cervical cancer, treated by radical surgery and a full course of post-OP RT, were included in this study. The indications for post-OP RT were based on pathological findings, including lymph node metastasis, positive surgical margins, parametrial extension, lymphovascular permeation, and invasion of more than two-thirds of the cervical wall thickness. The radiation dose of external beam was 44-45 Gy to the whole pelvis and 50-54 Gy to the true pelvis. One hundred seventy-two patients also received intravaginal brachytherapy as a local boost. The minimal follow-up period was 2 years. Results. The actuarial 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rates for all patients were 76 and 82%, respectively. The tumor control rate within the pelvis reached 94%, and distant metastasis was the major cause of treatment failure. Univariate analysis of clinical and pathological parameters revealed that clinical stage, bulky tumor size, positive lymph nodes, parametrial extension, and histologic type were significant prognostic factors. After multivariate analysis, only positive lymph nodes (P = 0.01), bulky tumor size (P = 0.02), and parametrial extension (P = 0.05) independently influenced the disease- specific survival (DSS). For patients with lymph node metastasis, the number and location of the nodal involvement significantly affected the prognosis. The 5-year DSS for patients with no, one, and more than one lymph node metastasis were 87, 84, and 61% (P = 0.0001), respectively. Patients with upper pelvic lymph node metastasis had a higher incidence of distant metastasis (50% vs 16% in lower pelvic node group, P = 0.03). In the subgroup of single lower pelvic nodal metastasis, the prognosis was similar to that of patients without lymph node involvement (5-year DSS 85% vs 87%, P = 0.71). Conclusion. Our results indicate that post-OP RT can achieve very good local control in stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients whose pathological findings show risk features for relapse after radical surgery. The prognostic factors for treatment failure identified in this study can be used as selection criteria for clinical trials to test the effects of other adjuvant treatments, such as chemotherapy. Patients with a single lower pelvic lymph node metastasis have a relatively good prognosis and may not need adjuvant treatment beyond radiation therapy.

0032908801	Polymerase chain reaction-based enzyme immunoassay for quantitation of telomerase activity: Application to colorectal cancers	Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomeric sequences onto human chromosomal ends. It appears to be present in the majority of primary human cancer tissues, and may have potential as a universal tumor marker. In this report, we describe a sensitive, non-radioactive, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the quantitation of telomerase activity in human cells. This PCR-EIA is convenient and can be easily completed within 3 h. The correlation coefficient between the results of PCR-EIA and the conventional telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) method, as measured on 4 different cell lines, was over 0.98. Evaluation of this method for clinical application was conducted with tissues obtained from patients with colorectal cancers and the results were compared with those of the conventional TRAP method. Our data indicate that telomerase activities measured by conventional TRAP and PCR-EIA are highly correlated, and we suggest that the PCR-EIA method can substitute for conventional TRAP.

0034069940	Telomerase activity is frequently found in metaplastic and malignant human nasopharyngeal tissues	Telomerase is a specialized ribonucleoprotein polymerase that directs the synthesis of telomere repeats at chromosome ends. Accumulating evidence has indicated that telomerase is stringently repressed in normal human somatic tissues but reactivated in cancers and immortal cells, suggesting that reactivation of telomerase plays an important role in carcinogenesis. In this study, the status of telomerase activity in diseased human nasopharyngeal lesions was determined by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). Fifty-four patients participated including 17 inflammation or hyperplasia, eight with squamous metaplasia, and 29 with different stages of carcinomas. Telomerase activity was detected in 1 of 17 (5.9%) inflammatory or lymphoid hyperplastic tissues, 3 of 8 (37.5%) squamous metaplastic, and 25 of 29 (86.2%) carcinoma tissues. The differences in telomerase expression in these groups is statistically significant (P < 0.001). Levels of telomerase activity correlated with tumour stage (P = 0.024). These results suggest that telomerase reactivation plays a role in the carcinogenesis of nasopharyngeal cancer. Since telomerase activity is found in the majority of nasopharyngeal cancers and a subset of metaplasia, this enzyme may be served as a reference to monitoring the status of abnormal nasopharyngeal tissues.

0034237598	The effect of nodal status on determinants of initial treatment response and patterns of relapse-free survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: To study the effect of regional nodal status on predictors of treatment response, failure patterns, and the time-dependent nature of the various pattern of relapse via a hazard function analysis.Methods and Materials: We reviews tumor control data of 496 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) to whom a radical course of radiotherapy (RT) with or without induction chemotherapy (CT) was given. All alive patients had a median follow-up period of 131 months. Primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) status were staged according to the TNM system of the American Joint Committee. Remote after-loading brachytherapy may be added to teletherapy in T1-2 lesions while induction CT could be given for N3 and/or T4 lesions. Hazard function analysis over 1-year interval was carried out for locoregional or distant relapse.Results: T stage and brachytherapy were two independent predictors for complete response (CR) at the primary site irrespective of nodal status, whereas N stage and brachytherapy are major determinants for regional CR in node (+) patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that contributors to a relatively long disease-free interval in (1) node (-) patients were for locoregional relapse, induction CT(-) (p = 0.0062) or brachytherapy (+) (p = 0.0268) and for distant relapse, none; (2) node (+) patients were for locoregional relapse, early T stage (p = 0.0377) or regional CR (p = 0.0075) and for distant relapse, induction CT(-) (p = 0.0001) or regional CR (p = 0.0001). In node (-) or (+) patients, primary CR rate yield no independent prognostic value on various types of disease-free survival. Hazard function analysis for relapse revealed that hazard rates are in general negatively correlated with time, being highest at the first year post-treatment, decreasing from time to time, and approaching zero after a longer follow-up period in patients with locoregional CR than in patients without.Conclusion: Nodal status had no significant impact on predictors of primary CR, whereas in node (+) patients regional CR rate had an independent value in predicting disease-free survival to locoregional and distant relapse. Hazard function analysis revealed a decreasing hazard rate over a protracted post-treatment time in primary and regional CR patients. This indicates the continued risk of late recurrence in this subset of patients for whom long-term observation is recommended. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

0034001327	Locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: To assess the outcome of and determine prognostic factors for locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in patients treated with a second course of radiotherapy (RT).Materials and methods: From 1982 to 1995, 186 NPC patients, who had initially been treated in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, developed local recurrence in the nasopharynx and were re-treated with RT (≥20 Gy). The time from the initial RT to re-treatment ranged from 8 to 136 months (median: 23 months). All patients were treated with external RT and conformal radiotherapy was used in 35 patients after 1993. Fifteen received radiosurgery as a boost treatment. The RT dose at the nasopharyngeal tumor area ranged from 20 to 67.2 Gy (median 50 Gy). Eighty-two patients received one to eight courses of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in addition to RT.Results: The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival was 54.9, 22.1 and 12.4%, respectively. Patients whose tumor relapsed later than 2 years after the first treatment had a better survival than those with earlier relapse (3-year survival: 30.1 vs. 10.8%; P=0.015), but the difference became insignificant in patients who received ≥50 Gy. Patients without evidence of intracranial invasion or cranial nerve palsy had better survival than those with such lesions (3-year survival: 30.9 vs. 3.7%; P=0.006). A re-treatment dose ≥50 Gy yielded better survival (3-year survival: 22.8 vs. 18.5%; P=0.003). Addition use of radiosurgery may improve survival. The use of chemotherapy did not improve survival. Conformal radiotherapy resulted in significantly fewer severe complications than conventional RT.Conclusions: A repeat course of RT for locally recurrent NPC successfully prolongs survival in a significant number of patients. Intracranial invasion and/or cranial nerve palsy and re-treatment dose affect the prognosis, with a dose of ≥50 Gy significantly improving survival. Radiosurgery boost may also improve survival. Our preliminary data indicates that conformal radiotherapy may decrease the severity of radiation-induced complications. However; longer follow-up and larger sample size is necessary to document the findings. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

39149123493	Analysis of risk factors of predictive local tumor control in oral cavity cancer	Background: Survival in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) depends heavily on locoregional control. In this study, we sought to determine the independent prognosticators for local tumor control, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) rates in a series of OSCC patients undergoing radical surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 827 consecutive OSCC patients undergoing radical surgery from January 1998 to March 2005. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed in patients with pT4 tumors, positive lymph node(s), or close margins (≤4 mm). Local control rates and survivals were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: On multivariate analysis (MVA), unfavorable prognostic factors for local control were pathological margins ≤7 mm (P < 0.001), pathological tumor depth ≥10 mm (P < 0.001), pathological positive lymph node(s) (P = 0.001), and the presence of betel quid chewing (P = 0.012). The same predictors, with the exception of betel quid chewing and pathological positive lymph node(s), were independently associated with DSS and OS in MVA. A prognostic scoring system was formulated by summing up the four significant local control covariates from MVA. Patients with scores of 3-4 had a significantly poorer local control rate compared to patients with scores of 0-2 (score 3 versus score 0-2: P < 0.001; score 4 versus score 0-2: P < 0.001) Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggest that pathological margins and pathological tumor depth are major independent prognosticators not only for local tumor control, but also for DSS and OS. © 2007 Society of Surgical Oncology.

3943108967	Nodal metastases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Patterns of disease on MRI and FDG PET	The patterns of nodal spread of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have an important influence on treatment planning, but have not yet been fully addressed. We prospectively used MRI and FDG PET to document the patterns of nodal spread in NPC. One hundred and one patients with newly diagnosed NPC were studied with MRI and FDG PET. On MRI, nodes were considered as metastatic according to criteria regarding size, the presence of nodal necrosis, and extracapsular spread. FDG PET images were interpreted visually, and nodes were considered metastatic if they showed prominent FDG uptake against the background. Nodal metastases were found in 89 of our 101 patients. Analysis of the distributions of nodal metastases in these 89 patients showed that retropharyngeal nodes were less frequently involved than cervical nodes (82.0% vs 95.5%). The vast majority of cervical nodal metastases were to the internal jugular chain, including nodes at levels II, III, and IV, with decreasing incidences of 95.5%, 60.7%, and 34.8%, respectively. Level V nodal involvement was found in 27% of patients. Supraclavicular fossa nodal metastases were not uncommon and occurred in 22.5% of patients. Skip metastases in the lower-level nodes or supraclavicular fossa nodes occurred in 7.9% of patients. Mediastinal and abdominal metastatic adenopathy was present in 4.5% and 3.4% of patients, respectively, and was associated with advanced nodal metastasis in the supraclavicular fossa. Level VI (2.2%), level VII (1.1%), submandibular (2.2%), and parotid (3.4%) nodal metastases were uncommon and were always associated with advanced ipsilateral nodal metastases of the neck. We conclude that the combined use of FDG PET and MRI can comprehensively depict the pattern of nodal metastasis in NPC patients. Nodal metastases principally affected level II nodes, from which lymphatic spread extended down in an orderly manner to involve level III, level IV, and the supraclavicular fossa nodes, or extended posteriorly to involve level V nodes. The frequency of skip metastases was 7.9%. Distant spread to mediastinal or abdominal nodes was found in 3-5% of patients, usually in association with supraclavicular nodal metastases.

39749189447	Neck treatment of patients with early stage oral tongue cancer: Comparison between observation, supraomohyoid dissection, and extended dissection	BACKGROUND. The role of elective and therapeutic selective neck dissection in patients with early stage cancer of the oral tongue remains controversial. The purpose was to investigate the role of neck treatment in the management of this condition. METHODS. A total of 380 patients with cT1-2N0 oral tongue cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were staged by means of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. A total of 324 patients received elective neck dissection (END), whereas 56 participants received observation (OBS). In all, 287 patients received supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOND), whereas 37 patients received modified radical neck dissection (MRND). Overall survival (OS) and neck control rates (NCR) were investigated according to the treatment modality. RESULTS. In the END group the occult metastasis (OM) rates in cervical lymph nodes were 5.2% for cT1 lesions and 14.6% for cT2 lesion (P = .005). The 5-year OS (P = .029) and NCR rates (P = .001) were significantly better in the END group compared with the OBS group. Patients who received MRND had a better 5-year NCR compared with SOND, albeit not significantly (91.4% vs 85.3%, P = .415). Multivariate analysis showed that END and stage were independent predictors of both NCR and OS. CONCLUSIONS. END should be performed routinely in patients with early-stage oral tongue cancer, even in the presence of negative neck by CT scans and MRI. © 2008 American Cancer Society.

31744444385	T-fastener gastropexy and percutaneous gastrostomy under CT-fluoroscopic guidance in a patient with partial gastrectomy	The real-time images of computed tomography (CT)-fluoroscopy provide an excellent means of guidance for percutaneous interventions. We describe the performance of T-fastener gastropexy and percutaneous gastrostomy under CT-fluoroscopic guidance in a 59-year-old woman who had received total pharyngolaryngectomy for hypopharyngeal cancer and partial gastrectomy with Billroth II anastomosis for bleeding gastric ulcer 10 years before this operation. The previous gastric operation altered the gastrointestinal anatomy and made conventional fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous gastrostomy extremely difficult and risky. The T-fastener gastropexy and percutaneous gastrostomy were accomplished smoothly in a single session using CT-fluoroscopic guidance. This modified method of percutaneous gastrostomy may be useful in patients with anatomic distortion due to previous gastric surgery. ©2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

34249812928	T4b oral cavity cancer below the mandibular notch is resectable with a favorable outcome	According to the AJCC 2002 staging system, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC) with T4b is unresectable. Herein, we report on our surgical outcome for T4b OSCC. All patients were enrolled before 2002. From January 1996 to December 2000, 45 consecutive untreated T4b OSCC patients were included. According to the trans-axial plane of the mandibular notch on CT/MRI, seven were supra-notch T4b and 38 were infra-notch T4b tumors. Significantly higher 5-year loco-regional control and survivals were observed in patients with infra-notch T4b than with supra-notch T4b. In the infra-notch group, pN0-1 patients had a significantly higher 5-year loco-regional control and survivals than pN2 patients. Nerve invasion was the sole significant adverse factor for loco-regional control and survivals in the infra-notch T4b group with pN0-1. Our retrospective study demonstrated that OSCC patients of infra-notch T4b with pN0-1 and no nerve invasion might have a favorable surgical outcome. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40949128224	Treatment Outcome of Combined Modalities for Buccal Cancers: Unilateral or Bilateral Neck Radiation?	Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of treatment for buccal cancers and assess the impact of unilateral vs. bilateral adjuvant neck radiation. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the course of 145 patients newly diagnosed with buccal squamous cell carcinoma without distant metastases who completed definitive treatment between January 1994 and December 2000. Of 145 patients, 112 (77%) had Stage III or IV disease. All underwent radical surgery with postoperative radiotherapy (median dose, 64 Gy), including unilateral neck treatment in most (n = 120, 82.8%). After 1997, cisplatin-based concomitant chemoradiotherapy was given for high-risk patients with more than two involved lymph nodes, extracapsular spread, and/or positive margins. Results: The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for Stages I-IV was 87%, 83%, 61%, and 60%, respectively (p = 0.01). The most significant prognostic factor was N stage, with the 5-year disease-specific survival rate for N0, N1, and N2 being 79%, 65%, and 54%, respectively (p = 0.001). For patients with more than two lymph nodes or positive extracapsular spread, cisplatin-based concomitant chemoradiotherapy improved locoregional control (p = 0.02). Locoregional control did not differ between patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral neck treatments (p = 0.95). Contralateral neck failure occurred in only 2.1%. Conclusions: In patients with buccal carcinoma after radical resection, ipsilateral neck radiation is adequate. Bilateral prophylactic neck treatment does not confer an added benefit. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0034981829	Poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal cancer patients with low glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase activity	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic among well-defined ethnic groups in several world regions, such as Southeastern China and Taiwan. Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficiency, a sex-linked disorder, is one of the most common enzymopathies in Taiwan. The major role of G6PD is to generate NADPH to protect cells from oxidative damage, which is a major contributing factor to certain degenerative diseases, such as aging and cancer. In view of the coincidence of epidemic distribution of NPC and G6PD deficiency, as well as the house-keeping function of G6PD in cellular oxidative defense, we investigated the correlation of G6PD activity with NPC. The stage of NPC was classified by AJCC (1997) criteria. G6PD levels were determined in 108 NPC male patients and 75 healthy male individuals. The mean G6PD level of NPC patients was 218.9 U/10

84877099043	An international collaboration to harmonize the quantitative plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA assay for future biomarker-guided trials in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: Persistently elevated posttreatment plasma EBV DNA is a robust predictor of relapse in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, assay standardization is necessary for use in biomarker-driven trials. We conducted a study to harmonize the method between four centers with expertise in EBV DNA quantitation. Experimental Design: Plasma samples of 40 patients with NPC were distributed to four centers. DNA was extracted and EBV DNA copy number was determined by real-time quantitative PCR (BamHI-W primer/probe). Centers used the same protocol but generated their own calibrators. A harmonization study was then conducted using the same calibrators and PCR master mix and validated with ten pooled samples. Results: The initial intraclass correlations (ICC) for the first 40 samples between each center and the index center were 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-0.78], 0.70 (0.50-0.83), and 0.59 (0.35-0.76). The largest variability was the use of different PCR master mixes and calibrators. Standardization improved ICC to 0.83 (0.5-0.95), 0.95 (0.83-0.99) and 0.96 (0.86-0.99), respectively, for ten archival frozen samples. For fresh plasma with spiked-in EBV DNA, correlations were more than 0.99 between the centers. At 5 EBV DNA copies per reaction or above, the coefficient of variance (CV) was less than 10% for the cycle threshold (C

43049165467	Does Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Improve Outcomes In pT1-3N0 Oral Cavity Cancer With Tumor-Free Margins and Perineural Invasion?	Purpose: The criteria for administration of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain controversial, and it is unclear whether patients with pT1-3N0 disease benefit from adjuvant radiation in the presence of free margins and perineural invasion. The goal of this report was to determine whether this group would benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy in terms of 5-year local control rate and overall survival rate. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed our case records from January 1996 to May 2005. In all, 460 pT1-3N0 OSCC patients had tumor-free margins, of whom 68 had perineural invasion. Postoperative adjuvant RT was performed in patients with pT4 tumors, positive lymph nodes, or close margins (≤4 mm). In addition, selected OSCC patients with large pT3 tumors or perineural invasion received postoperative adjuvant RT. Local control and overall survival rates were plotted by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: There were no significant differences in 5-year local control (p = 0.1936) and overall survival (p = 0.5580) rates between patients with perineural invasion compared with those without. Among patients with perineural invasion, the addition of adjuvant radiotherapy did not significantly alter the 5-year local control rate (p = 0.3170) or the overall survival rate (p = 0.0935). Conclusion: Altogether, these data seem to indicate that radical surgical resection alone should be considered a sufficient treatment for OSCC patients with pT1-3N0 disease, even in the presence of perineural invasion. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

4344639395	Contemporary management of penile cancer including surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy: An experience in Taiwan	This retrospective study reports on the treatment outcomes of 45 men with penile cancer and seeks to address the issue concerning the treatment of inguinal lymph nodes (LN). Of these 45 patients, five had verrucous carcinoma and the other 40 had squamous cell carcinoma. Eighteen patients had inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) metastasis and received treatments of inguinal LNs involving bilateral inguinal LN dissection or unilateral inguinal LN dissection with or without postoperative radiotherapy. The median follow-up was 37 months. The ultimate local and regional controls for patients with verrucous carcinoma were 100 and 100%, respectively. Among the 40 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the overall local control rate was 90%. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of patients without or with pathological inguinal LN metastasis were 70 vs. 22% (p = 0.01), and 55 vs. 16% (p = 0.004), respectively. The regional failure rates after inguinal LN dissection for pathological inguinal LN metastasis were 11% (1/9) and 60% (3/5) in patients with and without adjuvant radiotherapy. This study demonstrates that verrucous carcinoma shows excellent treatment outcomes following surgery alone. Squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is associated with a high incidence of inguinal lymph node metastasis. Elective groin dissection is indicated for all penile cancer patients except those with verrucous carcinoma and pT1 cancer with well-differentiated tumor. For patients with pathologically positive inguinal LN metastasis, adjuvant radiotherapy can increase inguinal control in this study. It warrants further prospective trial to prove the value of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with pathological documented inguinal LN metastasis in penile cancer. © Springer-Verlag 2003.

48749119607	Internal consistency of the traditional Chinese character version of the functional assessment of cancer therapy - Head and neck (FACT-H&N)	Background: This study investigated the internal consistency of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H&N) translated version in traditional Chinese characters (TChi). The FACT-H&N quality of life instrument is composed of the FACT-General (FACT-G) assessing four primary areas of well-being (physical, social/family, emotional, and functional) and 11 additional items specific to H&N cancer patients. Methods: Two hundred and three patients with H&N cancer were recruited at a medical center in northwestern Taiwan. All completed the TChi FACT-H&N along with demographic and clinical questionnaires written in traditional Chinese characters. Several psychometric properties of the TChi FACT-H&N were examined, including Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Results: Most of the 203 enrolled patients were men (78%). The median age was 52.5 years (range 23-81 years) and the median number of years of education was 9. All patients had a Karnofsky score of 70 or higher. The results showed that the TChi FACT-H&N scales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency. Translation of the physical and functional concepts was most straightforward. Translation of emotional items, however, posed some difficulties. The social/ family well-being subscale was problematic, as expected, based upon observations of cultural differences in social values and functioning. We also noted that concerns about hearing were different between patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and those with other H&N cancers. Conclusion: The TChi FACT-H&N is reliable. Items related to problems with hearing should be added to better evaluate the quality of life in patients with NPC.

48149100762	When does skin excision allow the achievement of an adequate local control rate in patients with squamous cell carcinoma involving the buccal mucosa?	Background: The role of cheek skin excision in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa (BSCC) remains controversial. We sought to investigate when skin excision is needed to achieve an adequate local control. Methods: A total of 331 patients with BSCC were reviewed. Skin preservation was pursued when the distance between the tumor and the skin as determined by imaging was ≥13 mm (1 cm surgical margin plus 0.3 cm skin preservation). Two hundred and thirty patients (69.5%) underwent skin excision. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (n = 182) was performed in patients with pathological T4 disease, metastases in cervical lymph nodes or close pathological margins (≤4 mm). The 5-year local control rate was plotted by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Twenty-four patients (7.3%) had close pathological margins. The 5-year local control rate did not differ significantly between patients treated either with or without skin excision. This was verified both in subjects who received surgery alone (94% versus 91%) and in those who received surgery plus adjuvant therapy (82% versus 86%). Conclusion: In patients with BSCC, a good 5-year local control rate may be equally achieved either with or without skin excision. In patients with pT3 disease, postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended in the absence of close pathological margins. Our findings may guide clinical decision-making on skin excision in this patient group. © 2008 Society of Surgical Oncology.

49749121765	Head and neck cancer in the betel quid chewing area: Recent advances in molecular carcinogenesis	Head and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the 10 most frequent cancers worldwide, with an estimated over 500.000 new cases being diagnosed annually. The overall 5-year survival rate in patients with HNC is one of the lowest among common malignant neoplasms and has not significantly changed during the last two decades. Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) shares part of HNC and has been reported to be increasing in the betel quid chewing area in recent years. During 2006, OSCC has become the sixth most common type of cancer in Taiwan, and it is also the fourth most common type of cancer among men. It follows that this type of cancer wreaks a high social and personal cost. Environmental carcinogens such as betel quid chewing, tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking have been identified as major risk factors for head and neck cancer. There is growing interest in understanding the relationship between genetic susceptibility and the prevalent environmental carcinogens for HNC prevention. Within this review, we discuss the molecular and cellular aspects of HNC carcinogenesis in Taiwan, an endemic betel quid chewing area. Knowledge of molecular carcinogenesis of HNC may provide critical clues for diagnosis, prognosis, individualization of therapy and molecular therapeutics. © 2008 Japanese Cancer Association.

54049114742	Glucose-regulated protein 78 regulates multiple malignant phenotypes in head and neck cancer and may serve as a molecular target of therapeutic intervention	Glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein and is overexpressed in various cancers. However, it is unclear how significance of this molecule play an active role contributing to the oncogenic effect of head and neck cancer (HNC). To investigate the potential function of Grp78, six HNC cell lines were used. We found that Grp78 is highly expressed in all six cell lines and many of the proteins were localized in the periphery regions, implying other function of this molecule aside from endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Knockdown of Grp78 by small interfering RNA significantly reduced cell growth and colony formation to 53% to 12% compared with that of controls in all six HNC cell lines. Using in vitro wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, we found that cell migration and invasive ability were also inhibited to 23% to 2% in all these cell lines tested. In vivo xenograft studies showed that administration of Grp78-small interfering RNA plasmid into HNC xenografts significantly inhibited both tumor growth in situ (>60% inhibition at day 34) and liver metastasis (>90% inhibition at day 20). Our study showed that Grp78 actively regulates multiple malignant phenotypes, including cell growth, migration, and invasion. Because knockdown Grp78 expression succeeds in the reduction of tumor growth and metastatic potential, this molecule may serve as a molecular target of therapeutic intervention for HNC.

57249115924	Staging of untreated nasopharyngeal carcinoma with PET/CT: Comparison with conventional imaging work-up	Purpose: We prospectively compared PET/CT and conventional imaging for initial staging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: A total of 111 patients with histologically proven NPC were investigated with PET/CT and conventional imaging (head-and-neck MRI, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and bone scan) before treatment. The respective findings were reviewed independently and then compared with each other. Results: With regard to T staging, PET/CT showed a discrepancy with head-and-neck MRI in 36 (32.4%) of the study subjects. With regard to N staging, PET/CT showed a discrepancy with head-and-neck MRI in 15 (13.5%) patients. Among the discordant cases, MRI was superior in demonstrating tumor involvement in the parapharyngeal space, skull base, intracranial area, sphenoid sinus, and retropharyngeal nodes while PET/CT was superior in demonstrating neck nodal metastasis. PET/CT disclosed 13 of 16 patients with distant malignancy compared with four patients disclosed by conventional imaging work-up. The false-positive rate of PET/CT was 18.8%. PET/CT correctly modified M staging in eight patients (7.2%) and disclosed a second primary lung malignancy in one patient (0.9%). Conclusion: In NPC patients, MRI appears to be superior to PET/CT for the assessment of locoregional invasion and retropharyngeal nodal metastasis. PET/CT is more accurate than MRI for determining cervical nodal metastasis and should be the better reference for the neck status. PET/CT has an acceptable diagnostic yield and a low false-positive rate for the detection of distant malignancy and can replace conventional work-up to this aim. PET/CT and head-and-neck MRI are suggested for the initial staging of NPC patients. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

58549097278	Risk stratification of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma and contralateral neck recurrence following radical surgery	Clinical outcome of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and contralateral neck recurrence (CLNR) remains poor. We sought to identify factors associated with CLNR and incorporate them into a risk stratification scheme. Between January 1996 and June 2006, a total of 913 consecutive OSCC patients treated by radical surgery were investigated. Postoperative adjuvant therapy was performed in the presence of pathological risk factors. The duration of follow-up was at least 24 months in all surviving patients. Outcome measures were the 5-year CLNR and overall survival rates. In the entire study cohort, the 5-year CLNR rate was 7% (55/913). Specifically, it was 18% (17/132) in patients with local recurrence (LR), and 5% (38/781) in those without (P = 0.0002). In multivariate analysis, extracapsular spread (ECS) was the only independent risk factor for CLNR in patients with LR. Tumor subsite, poor differentiation, and presence of pN + disease were significant predictors of CLNR in patients without LR. We identified two groups of patients with high CLNR rates. The first group consisted of patients with ECS at the initial diagnosis and LR. The second group consisted of subjects with tongue cancer without LR harboring at least two risk factors. We conclude that, in patients who achieved local control, postoperative contralateral neck treatment is recommended for subjects with tongue cancer and at least two risk factors. Once LR occurs, contralateral neck treatment is recommended in patients with ECS. © 2008 Society of Surgical Oncology.

59649102420	Pretreatment Primary Tumor SUVmax Measured by FDG-PET and Pathologic Tumor Depth Predict for Poor Outcomes in Patients With Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Pathologically Positive Lymph Nodes	Purpose: The pathologic tumor depth is an independent prognosticator for local control (LC) and survival in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We sought to investigate the prognostic value of the preoperative maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at the primary tumor in OSCC patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes. Methods and Materials: A total of 109 OSCC patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes were investigated. All patients underwent 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose-positron emission tomography within 2 weeks before surgery and neck dissection. All patients were followed for ≥24 months after surgery or until death. The optimal cutoff value for the primary tumor SUVmax was selected according to the 5-year LC rate. Independent prognosticators were identified by Cox regression analysis. Results: The median follow-up for all patients was 26 months (39 months for surviving patients). A cutoff SUVmax of 19.3 provided the greatest prognostic information for the 5-year LC rate (55% vs. 88%, p = 0.0135). A tumor depth ≥12 mm appeared to be the most appropriate cutoff for predicting the 5-year LC rate (76% vs. 95%, p = 0.0075). A scoring system using the primary tumor SUVmax and tumor depth was formulated to define distinct prognostic groups. Patients with both a SUVmax of ≥19.3 and tumor depth of ≥12 mm (n = 8) had significantly poorer 5-year LC, 5-year disease-free, 5-year disease-specific, and 5-year overall survival rates compared with the other patient groups. Conclusion: The combination of the primary tumor SUVmax (≥19.3) and pathologic tumor depth (≥12 mm) identified a subgroup of OSCC patients at greatest risk of poor LC and death. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

6344237620	Recent advances in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The outcome of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment has greatly improved as advances in imaging techniques increase the accuracy of tumor mapping. Radiotherapy remains a common treatment for early disease, while concurrent chemoradiotherapy is being increasingly accepted as the standard treatment for advanced disease. Intensity modulation radiotherapy (IMRT) delivers a more conformal radiation dose to the target area and may spare normal organs such as parotid gland for patients with early stage disease. IMRT in conjunction with concurrent chemotherapy offers excellent tumor control with fewer complications. These benefits suggest it will become the mainstay of radiotherapy treatment for NPC. Prevention of distant metastasis remains a crucial objective. The potential of induction chemotherapy to reduce distant metastasis has gained increased attention. Adjuvant chemotherapy has been unsuccessful due to poor tolerability. For metastasic NPC, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is effective but limited by cumulative toxicities. Newer drugs such gemcitabine and vinorelbine have been shown to be active in salvage therapy when cisplatin-containing combinations have failed. Due to their advantageous toxicity profiles, new drugs may replace cisplatin-based combinations as first-line treatment for metastasic NPC in the near future. Signal transduction manipulation is promising but has not been shown to be an essential therapy. Immunotherapy, such as mini-transplant, may offer the chance for durable control without long-term treatment, but its efficacy remains to be demonstrated.

67649616515	Preoperative [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Standardized Uptake Value of Neck Lymph Nodes Predicts Neck Cancer Control and Survival Rates in Patients With Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Pathologically Positive Lymph Nodes	Purpose: Survival in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) depends heavily on locoregional control. In this prospective study, we sought to investigate whether preoperative maximum standardized uptake value of the neck lymph nodes (SUVnodal-max) may predict prognosis in OSCC patients. Methods and Materials: A total of 120 OSCC patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes were investigated. All subjects underwent a [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan within 2 weeks before radical surgery and neck dissection. All patients were followed up for at least 24 months after surgery or until death. Postoperative adjuvant therapy was performed in the presence of pathologic risk factors. Optimal cutoff values of SUVnodal-max were chosen based on 5-year disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). Independent prognosticators were identified by Cox regression analysis. Results: The median follow-up for surviving patients was 41 months. The optimal cutoff value for SUVnodal-max was 5.7. Multivariate analyses identified the following independent predictors of poor outcome: SUVnodal-max ≥5.7 for the 5-year neck cancer control rate, distant metastatic rate, DFS, DSS, and extracapsular spread (ECS) for the 5-year DSS and OS. Among ECS patients, the presence of a SUVnodal-max ≥5.7 identified patients with the worst prognosis. Conclusion: A SUVnodal-max of 5.7, either alone or in combination with ECS, is an independent prognosticator for 5-year neck cancer control and survival rates in OSCC patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

69549129415	Transcriptome profiling and network pathway analysis of genes associated with invasive phenotype in oral cancer	The aim of this study was to clarify relevant alterations of gene expression associated with the invasive phenotype of oral cancer. To reduce heterogeneity and to obtain data on genes specifically involved in invasive mechanism, we established a highly invasive ORC subline through in vitro Matrigel invasion method. Affymetrix microarrays were used for transcriptome profiling between parental and the highly invasive subline. Seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed at least 2-fold, including 38 up-regulated and 41 down-regulated. After analyzing the microarray data by MetaCore™ algorithm, a total of 12 regulatory pathways were found to be associated with invasive phenotype (p < 0.001). Two functional pathways were most significant: the cell adhesion through extracellular matrix remodeling (p = 4.964e-06), and MHC-class-I mediated antigen presentation (p = 9.843e-05). To shed more light on the biological functions of invasiveness, two genes highly over-expressed in the invasive subline, Cyr61 and CD44 were further validated. RNAi knockdown of these two genes led to significant suppression of cell growth (32% and 31%, respectively at day 3), cell migration (45% and 96%, respectively at 24 h), and cell invasion (83% and 87%, respectively at day 3). These results suggested important roles of these genes in regulating invasive phenotype, and demonstrated the confidence of this study design in the search of invasive associated genes. The identified pathways associated with invasion mechanism may be novel targets for manipulation of the cancer behavior with consequences on treatment outcome. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

69249221527	Preirradiation sinus mucosal disease in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and the possible risk factors for preirradiation abnormalities of the sinus mucosa in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by magnetic resonance imaging. Materials and methods: Medical records and magnetic resonance imaging results were reviewed and compared between a group of patients with NPC and a control group. The Lund-Mackay system for staging of rhinosinusitis (Lund score) was used as a tool for the investigation. Results: The incidence of sinus mucosal abnormalities was 32.1% in the NPC group and 20.7% in the control group (P = .041). The patients with NPC demonstrated a higher incidence of sinus abnormalities in nearly all sinuses. However, only the incidence of disease in the posterior ethmoid (P = .002) and sphenoid sinus (P = .006) was significantly increased in patients with NPC. The incidence and the severity of sinus abnormalities in male patients with NPC were significantly higher than that in female patients. Patients with advanced T stage showed significantly higher Lund scores (P = .015) than patients with early T stage. Conclusion: The results supported the hypothesis that patients with NPC might be prone to have chronic infection and might be partially immunocompromised by Epstein-Barr virus. Female patients may have an inherited genetic advantage that protects against Epstein-Barr virus infection or lessens its devastating effects. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0034801362	Characteristics of mutations in the p53 gene in oral squamous cell carcinoma associated with betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking in Taiwanese	p53 mutations are etiologically associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) or are associated with exposure to specific carcinogens. In this study, we used PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing to analyze the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) in OSCC tumor specimens from 187 patients with varied histories of betel quid, tobacco and alcohol use. Ninety-one of the 187 OSCCs (48.66%) showed p53 gene mutations at exons 5-9. The incidence of p53 mutations was not associated with age, sex, TNM stage, status of cigarette smoking or betel quid chewing. However, alcohol drinkers exhibited a significantly higher incidence (57/101, 56.44%) of p53 mutations than non-users (39.53%, 34/86) (P = 0.02). The effect of alcohol on the incidence of p53 mutations was still statistically significant (RR = 2.24; 95% CI, 1.21-4.15) after adjustment for cigarette smoking and betel quid (BQ) chewing. G:C to A:T transitions were the predominant mutations observed and associated with BQ and tobacco use. Alcohol drinking could enhance these transitions. After adjustment for cigarette smoking and BQ chewing, alcohol drinking still showed an independent effect on G:C to A:T transitions (RR = 2.41; 95% CI, 1.01-5.74). These findings strongly suggest an important contributive role of tobacco carcinogens to p53 mutation in this series of Taiwanese OSCCs and alcohol might enhance these mutagenic effects. As safrole-DNA adducts have been detected in 77% (23/30) of the OSCC tissues from Taiwanese oral cancer patients with a BQ chewing history, we cannot rule out the possibility that safrole or other carcinogens present in the BQ may cause a similar pattern of mutagenesis. Determination of the role of safrole and other carcinogens present in BQ on the pattern of p53 gene mutation in OSCC will require further study.

0035479090	Isolated paraaortic lymph node recurrence after definitive irradiation for cervical carcinoma	Purpose: To evaluate the clinical features of isolated paraaortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence after definitive radiotherapy, and analyze the prognostic factors and effect of salvage treatment. Methods and Materials: Of a total 876 patients who received pelvic radiotherapy after the diagnosis of primary cervical carcinoma, 26 were found to have isolated PALN recurrence as the first recurrent site, and these patients enrolled in this study. Only those with primary-site carcinoma controlled and who were free of other distant metastases were eligible. Nineteen of the 26 patients accepted salvage therapy. Fourteen patients accepted concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT), 1 accepted radiation to the paraaortic region, and 4 accepted chemotherapy alone. Clinical parameters evaluated included tumor markers (SCC and CEA) and image studies. Results: Seven of the 26 patients were alive and disease-free. All 7 survivors had salvage treatment with radiation to the paraaortic region and concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy. None of the patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation alone enjoyed long-term, disease-free survival. The 5-year survival rate for isolated PALN recurrence of the 14 patients who accepted salvage concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) was 51.2%. The presence of a clinical symptom at the time of PALN recurrence was analyzed. Seven of the 12 asymptomatic patients and none of the 14 symptomatic patients survived without disease after salvage treatment. The SCC levels at recurrence showed a statistically significant relationship to disease-free survival. Conclusions: An SCC level of ≤ 4 ng/ml and a lack of symptoms at the time of recurrence were good prognostic factors in isolated PALN recurrence after primary radiation therapy. In addition to concurrent CCRT, periodical surveillance with tumor markers and imaging studies allowed early detection and salvage of those patients. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

71449090898	Pretreatment evaluation of distant-site status in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Accuracy of whole-body MRI at 3-Tesla and FDG-PET-CT	We sought to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of 3.0-Tesla whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) and integrated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (FDG-PET-CT), and their combined interpretation for the assessment of distant-site status in 150 patients with untreated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Eighteen (12%) patients were diagnosed as having distant malignancies (15 patients had distant metastases, and three distant synchronous tumours). On a patient-based analysis, WB-MRI and FDG-PET-CT showed similar sensitivity (77.8% vs 72.2%, P>0.999), specificity (98.5% vs 97.7%, P>0.999) and diagnostic capability (0.905 vs 0.878, P=0.669). Combined interpretation of WB-MRI and FDG-PET-CT showed no significant benefit over either technique alone. In conclusion, 3.0-Tesla WB-MRI is a feasible, non-ionising technique that showed similar diagnostic capacity to FDG-PET-CT in assessing distant-site status in patients with untreated NPC and can be recommended as the first-line imaging technique for comprehensive evaluation of such patients. © 2009 European Society of Radiology.

Methods and Materials: Four hundred and eight sequential NPC patients who had received regular annual thyroid hormone surveys prospectively after radiotherapy were included in this study. Median patient age was 47.3 years, and 286 patients were male. Thyroid function was prospectively evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and serum free thyroxine (FT4) levels. Low FT4 levels indicated clinical hypothyroidism in this study. Results: With a median follow-up of 4.3 years (range, 0.54-19.7 years), the incidence of low FT4 level was 5.3%, 9.0%, and 19.1% at 3, 5, and 10 years after radiotherapy, respectively. Hypothyroidism was more common with early T stage (p = 0.044), female sex (p = 0.037), and three-dimensional conformal therapy with the altered fractionation technique (p = 0.005) after univariate analysis. N stage, chemotherapy, reirradiation, and neck electron boost did not affect the incidence of hypothyroidism. Younger age and conformal therapy were significant factors that determined clinical hypothyroidism after multivariate analysis. Overall, patients presented with a low FT4 level about 1 year after presenting with an elevated TSH level. Conclusion: Among our study group of NPC patients, 19.1% experienced clinical hypothyroidism by 10 years after treatment. Younger age and conformal therapy increased the risk of hypothyroidism. We suggest routine evaluation of thyroid function in NPC patients after radiotherapy. The impact of pituitary injury should be also considered. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77951249167	Transdermal fentanyl for pain caused by radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients treated in an outpatient setting: A multicenter trial in Taiwan	Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl in the outpatient treatment of head and neck cancer patients with pain caused by radiotherapy. Methods: Patients with a visual analogue scale score ≥ 4 were invited to participate in the study. The following variables were collected: visual analogue scale, the Brief Pain Inventory, concomitant pain medications and adverse effects. A total of 163 head and neck cancer patients were enrolled (148 males and 15 females; median age, 53 years; age range, 21-72 years). Seventy-two (44%) patients had a visual analogue scale score > 6 at enrollment, despite the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or weak opioids. Ninety-four (57.7%) patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Results: A total of 88 patients completed the study, whereas 55 underwent a drop-out by side effects. The most frequently reported adverse events were vomiting (23.9%) and nausea (16.6%). Treatment with transdermal fentanyl resulted in a significant decrease in visual analogue scale and Brief Pain Inventory scores that persisted during treatment. In the overall efficacy evaluation, the pain-alleviating effect, the easiness of application and the overall impression of transdermal fentanyl were rated as good by 54.5%, 65.9% and 59.1% of the completers, respectively. Effects of transdermal fentanyl were rated as good by 64.8% of the investigators. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that transdermal fentanyl is effective and relatively easy to use for outpatient treatment of pain control in head and neck cancer patients following radiotherapy in selected patients. Reduction of side effects and effective pain management need to be paramount in the management of head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. © The Author (2009).

77951853565	Influence of Pathological Nodal Status and Maximal Standardized Uptake Value of the Primary Tumor and Regional Lymph Nodes on Treatment Plans in Patients With Advanced Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma	Purpose: A better understanding of the prognostic factors in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) may optimize the therapeutic approach. In this study, we sought to investigate whether the combination of clinical information, pathologic results, and preoperative maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes might improve the prognostic stratification in this patient group. Methods and Materials: A total of 347 consecutive OSCC patients were investigated. All participants underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography within 2 weeks before surgery and neck dissection. The duration of follow-up was at least 24 months in all surviving patients. The optimal cutoff values for SUVmax at the primary tumor (SUVtumor-max) and regional lymph nodes (SUVnodal-max) were selected according to the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate. Independent prognosticators were identified by Cox regression analysis. Results: In multivariate analysis, a cutoff SUVtumor-max of 8.6, a cutoff SUVnodal-max of 5.7, and the presence of pathologic lymph node metastases were found to be significant prognosticators for the 5-year DFS. A scoring system using these three prognostic factors was formulated to define distinct prognostic groups. The 5-year rates for patients with a score between 0 and 3 were as follows: neck control, 94%, 86%, 77%, 59% (p < 0.0001); distant metastases, 1%, 7%, 22%, 47% (p < 0.0001); disease-specific survival, 93%, 85%, 61%, 36%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Based on the study findings, the combined evaluation of pathologic node status and SUVmax at the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes may improve prognostic stratification in OSCC patients. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77953566272	Treatment Results of Postoperative Radiotherapy on Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity: Coexistence of Multiple Minor Risk Factors Results in Higher Recurrence Rates	Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the treatment results of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC). Materials and Methods: This study included 302 OSCC patients who were treated by radical surgery and PORT. Indications for PORT include Stage III or IV OSCC according to the 2002 criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, the presence of perineural invasion or lymphatic invasion, the depth of tumor invasion, or a close surgical margin. Patients with major risk factors, such as multiple nodal metastases, a positive surgical margin, or extracapsular spreading, were excluded. The prescribed dose of PORT ranged from 59.4 to 66.6Gy (median, 63Gy). Results: The 3-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 73% and 70%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that differentiation, perineural invasion, lymphatic invasion, bone invasion, location (hard palate and retromolar trigone), invasion depths ≥10mm, and margin distances ≤4mm were significant prognostic factors. The presence of multiple significant factors of univariate analysis correlated with disease recurrence. The 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were 82%, 76%, and 45% for patients with no risk factors, one or two risk factors, and three or more risk factors, respectively. After multivariate analysis, the number of risk factors and lymphatic invasion were significant prognostic factors. Conclusion: PORT may be an adequate adjuvant therapy for OSCC patients with one or two risk factors of recurrence. The presence of multiple risk factors and lymphatic invasion correlated with poor prognosis, and more aggressive treatment may need to be considered. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77955611544	Positive association of glucose-regulated protein 78 during oral cancer progression and the prognostic value in oral precancerous lesions	Background. Our aim was to examine the potential role of glucose-regulated protein (GRP)78 during oral cancer progression and the prognostic value in oral precancerous lesions. Methods. A total of 204 patients with oral cancer and 86 with precancerous lesions were investigated. GRP78 expression was determined in the lesion tissues by Western blot analysis. Association of GRP78 with clinicopathology or disease prognosis was examined using Fisher's exact, Kaplan-Meier, or Cox regression method. Results. Hyperexpression of GRP78 was found to be correlated with increasing malignant potential of oral lesions, with 14% in leukoplakia, 27% in erythroplakia, 50% in verrucous lesion, and 74% in oral cancer (p < .0001), suggesting this molecule plays a crucial role in the early steps of oral oncogenesis. In patients with precancerous lesions of the oral cavity, GRP78 expression predicts poorer same-site premalignancy-free survival (p = .002) and malignancy-free survival rates (p = .002). Conclusion. Determination of GRP78 expression levels might enable a better risk stratification for patients with oral premalignant lesions. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77955923224	Proteomics of the radioresistant phenotype in head-and-neck cancer: GP96 as a novel prediction marker and sensitizing target for radiotherapy	Purpose: Radiotherapy is an integral part of the treatment modality for head-neck cancer (HNC), but in some cases the disease is radioresistant. We designed this study to identify molecules that may be involved in this resistance. Methods and Materials: Two radioresistant sublines were established by fractionated irradiation of the HNC cell lines, to determine differentially proteins between parental and radioresistant cells. Proteomic analysis and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to identify and confirm the differential proteins. The siRNA knockdown experiments were applied to examine cellular functions of a radioresistant gene, with investigation of the alterations in colonogenic survival, cell cycle status, and reactive oxygen species levels. Xenografted mouse tumors were studied to validate the results. Results: IN all, 64 proteins were identified as being potentially associated with radioresistance, which are involved in several cellular pathways, including regulation of stimulus response, cell apoptosis, and glycolysis. Six genes were confirmed to be differentially expressed in both radioresistant sublines, with Gp96, Grp78, HSP60, Rab40B, and GDF-15 upregulated, and annexin V downregulated. Gp96 was further investigated for its functions in response to radiation. Gp96-siRNA transfectants displayed a radiation-induced growth delay, reduction in colonogenic survival, increased cellular reactive oxygen species levels, and increased proportion of the cells in the G2/M phase. Xenograft mice administered Gp96-siRNA showed significantly enhanced growth suppression in comparison with radiation treatment alone (p = 0.009). Conclusions: We identified 64 proteins and verified 6 genes that are potentially involved in the radioresistant phenotype. We further demonstrated that Gp96 knockdown enhances radiosensitivity both in cells and in vivo, which may lead to a better prognosis of HNC treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77957946418	Comprehensive imaging of residual/recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma using whole-body MRI at 3 T compared with FDG-PET-CT	Objective: To prospectively compare the diagnostic potential of 3-T wholebody magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) and integrated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (FDG-PET-CT), and their combined interpretation for the detection of residual/recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: We enrolled 179 NPC patients at high risk of residual disease or with suspected recurrence. WB-MRI and FDG-PET-CT were obtained with an interval of <10days. Results: Fifty-five (30.7%) patients were found to have residual/recurrent tumours. In a patient-based analysis, the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic capability of WB-MRI were similar to those of FDG-PET-CT (90.9% vs. 87.3%, P=0.69; 91.1% vs. 90.3%, P>0.99; 0.929 vs. 0.924, P= 0.83, respectively). Combined interpretation of WB-MRI with FDG-PET-CT increased the sensitivity to 94.5%. A slight improvement in the diagnostic capability was obtained using a combined interpretation of WB-MRI and FDG-PET-CT over WB-MRI alone (0.952 vs. 0.929, P= 0.22) and FDG-PET-CT alone (0.952 vs. 0.924, P=0.11). Conclusions: Three-Tesla WB-MRI achieved a similar diagnostic capability to FDG-PET-CT for the detection of residual/recurrent NPC. Both techniques have different advantages, and their combined interpretation can yield a slightly higher diagnostic capability. In clinical practice, 3-T WB-MRI can offer an accurate and comprehensive assessment of residual/recurrent NPC. © European Society of Radiology 2010.

77957360232	Treatment results for hypopharyngeal cancer by different treatment strategies and its secondary primary- an experience in Taiwan	Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate treatment results in our hypopharyngeal cancer patients.Patients and Methods: A total of three hundred and ninety five hypopharyngeal cancer patients received radical treatment at our hospital; 96% were male. The majority were habitual smokers (88%), alcohol drinkers (73%) and/or betel quid chewers (51%). All patients received a CT scan or MRI for tumor staging before treatment. The stage distribution was stage I: 2 (0.5%); stage II: 22 (5.6%); stage III: 57 (14.4%) and stage IV: 314 (79.5%). Radical surgery was used first in 81 patients (20.5%), and the remaining patients (79.5%) received organ preservation-intended treatment (OPIT). In the OPIT group, 46 patients received radiotherapy alone, 156 patients received chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (CT/RT) and 112 patients received concomitant chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT).Results: The five-year overall survival rates for stages I/II, III and IV were 49.5%, 47.4% and 18.6%, respectively. There was no significant difference in overall and disease-specific survival rates between patients who received radical surgery first and those who received OPIT. In the OPIT group, CCRT tended to preserve the larynx better (p = 0.088), with three-year larynx preservation rates of 44.8% for CCRT and 27.2% for CT/RT. Thirty-seven patients developed a second malignancy, with an annual incidence of 4.6%.Conclusions: There was no survival difference between OPIT and radical surgery in hypopharyngeal cancer patients at our hospital. CCRT may offer better laryngeal preservation than RT alone or CT/RT. However, prospective studies are still needed to confirm this finding. Additionally, second primary cancers are another important issue for hypopharyngeal cancer management. © 2010 Chang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77958494111	Primary tumor site as a predictor of treatment outcome for definitive radiotherapy of advanced-stage oral cavity cancers	Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of definitive radiotherapy (RT) for oral cavity cancers and to assess prognostic factors. Methods and Materials: Definitive RT was performed on 115 patients with oral cavity cancers at Stages III, IVA, and IVB, with a distribution of 6%, 47%, and 47%, respectively. The median dose of RT was 72Gy (range, 62-76Gy). Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was administered to 95% of the patients. Eleven patients underwent salvage surgery after RT failure. Results: Eight-eight (76.5%) patients responded partially and 23 (20%) completely; of the patients who responded, 18% and 57%, respectively, experienced a durable effect of treatment. The 3-year overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival were 22%, 27%, and 25%, respectively. The 3-year PFS rates based on the primary tumor sites were as follows: Group I (buccal, mouth floor, and gum) 51%, Group II (retromolar and hard palate) 18%, and Group III (tongue and lip) 6% (p < 0.0001). The 3-year progression-free survival was 41% for N0 patients and 19% for patients with N+ disease (p = 0.012). The T stage and RT technique did not affect survival. The patients who underwent salvage surgery demonstrated better 3-year overall survival and disease-specific survival (53% vs. 19%, p = 0.015 and 53% vs. 24%, p = 0.029, respectively). Subsite group, N+, and salvage surgery were the only significant prognostic factors for survival after multivariate analysis. Conclusion: The primary tumor site and neck stage are prognostic predictors in advanced-stage oral cancer patients who received radical RT. The primary tumor extension and RT technique did not influence survival. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78349311997	Highly potent and specific siRNAs against E6 or E7 genes of HPV16-or HPV18-infected cervical cancers	Infection with high-risk types (type 16 or type 18) of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) increases a patient's risk of cervical cancer. Given the importance of the cervix and the severe side effects resulting from traditional cancer therapies, this study aimed to achieve targeted inhibition of viral oncogenes in tumor cells using small interfering RNAs (siRNA). To accomplish this, we developed nine siRNAs against either the E6 or E7 genes of HPV-16 or HPV-18 in several combinations, yielding siRNAs targeting 16E6, 16E7, 18E6 and 18E7. We measured the effectiveness of the siRNAs by examining E6 or E7 mRNA expression after transfection of the siRNAs into HPV-positive CaSki (HPV-16) or HeLa (HPV-18) cell lines. We found that the HPV-siRNAs significantly reduced cell growth and colony formation in both cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in apoptosis. The siRNAs had no effect on cell growth, colony formation or apoptosis in HPV-negative C33A cells, demonstrating a lack of off-target effects. In addition, an in vivo xenograft study showed that intra-tumoral injection of the siRNAs reduced tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice. In conclusion, we have developed highly specific and potent HPV-siRNAs that successfully suppress tumor growth and induce apoptosis in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. siRNA treatment has potential for further development as an adjuvant therapy for cervical cancer. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

78650264694	Tissue classifications in Monte Carlo simulations of patient dose for photon beam tumor treatments	The purpose of this work was to study the calculated dose uncertainties induced by the material classification that determined the interaction cross-sections and the water-to-material stopping-power ratios. Calculations were made for a head- and neck-cancer patient treated with five intensity-modulated radiotherapy fields using 6MV photon beams. The patient's CT images were reconstructed into two voxelized patient phantoms based on different CT-to-material classification schemes. Comparisons of the depth-dose curve of the anterior-to-posterior field and the dose-volume-histogram of the treatment plan were used to evaluate the dose uncertainties from such schemes. The results indicated that any misassignment of tissue materials could lead to a substantial dose difference, which would affect the treatment outcome. To assure an appropriate material assignment, it is desirable to have different conversion tables for various parts of the body. The assignment of stopping-power ratio should be based on the chemical composition and the density of the material. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

78751499344	Downregulation of Ches1 and other novel genes in oral cancer cells chronically exposed to areca nut extract	Background This study was undertaken to identify the genes in response to areca nut extract, a potential carcinogen of oral cancer. Methods Two oral cancer sublines chronically treated with areca nut extract were established. Methods such as microarray and immunohistochemistry were used to screen and validate the genes' altered expressions in areca nut extract-sublines or in cancer tissues. Results A total of 35 genes were differentially expressed in both sublines. Several functional pathways were significantly altered. Six genes were confirmed over 2-fold of changes, including Ches1. Functional analyses showed that overexpression of Ches1 suppressed cell growth and arrested cells in the G2/M phase. Consistently, this gene has reduced expression in 52% of oral cancer tissues, which was significantly correlated with the areca nut chewing habit of patients (p =.04). Conclusion We identified 35 candidates and validated 6 genes that may be associated with areca nut-induced oral cancer. Loss of Ches1 may be attributed to areca nut extract-induced oral carcinogenesis. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck.

79955663607	Free flap reconstruction in the head and neck region following radiotherapy: A cohort study identifying negative outcome predictors	Background: With the increased use of radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancers, free tissue transfer in an irradiated field is now common. Reported outcomes with free tissue transfer reconstructions in irradiated areas are often unclear and contradictory. This is attributable in part to small sample size and heterogeneity in patients and procedures. The goals of this study were, first, to determine the outcome of head and neck reconstructions in an irradiated field using a large retrospective cohort and, second, to identify negative outcome predictors that could potentially be modified to reduce the morbidity in these procedures. Methods: Patients undergoing free flap reconstruction in irradiated head and neck regions between July of 2005 and July of 2007 were identified. Charts, including operative and radiotherapy records, were reviewed. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to identify negative outcome predictors. Results: During the study period at the authors' institution, 984 patients underwent head and neck free flap reconstruction. Of these, 137 had free tissue transferred to irradiated fields. Patients received an average radiotherapy dose of 64.5 Gy. The overall flap success rate was 96.4 percent. The postoperative complication rate was 47 percent. There was an overall 22 percent reoperation rate and a 28 percent infection rate. Segmental mandibulectomy, larger flap size, and infection were found to be significant negative outcome predictors. Conclusions: This study confirms that free flap transfer to previously irradiated head and neck areas has a success rate comparable to that of transfer to nonirradiated zones. However, previously irradiated patients have a high risk of complications. Infection, as a modifiable risk factor, should be treated aggressively.

0036373860	Differential regulation of telomerase activity by six telomerase subunits	Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase responsible for synthesizing telomeric DNA at the ends of chromosomes. Six subunits composing the telomerase complex have been cloned: hTR (human telomerase RNA), TEP1 (telomerase-associated protein 1), hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase), hsp90 (heat shock protein 90), p23, and dyskerin. In this study, we investigated the role of each the telomerase subunit on the activity of telomerase. Through down- or upregulation of telomerase, we found that only hTERT expression changed proportionally with the level of telomerase activity. The other components, TEP1, hTR, hsp90, p23, and dyskerin remained at high and unchanged levels throughout modulation. In vivo and in vitro experiments with antisense oligonucleotides against each telomerase component were also performed. Telomerase activity was decreased or abolished by antisense treatment. To correlate clinical sample status, four pairs of normal and malignant tissues from patients with oral cancer were examined. Except for the hTERT subunit, which showed differential expression in normal and cancer tissues, all other components were expressed in both normal and malignant tissues. We conclude that hTERT is a regulatable subunit, whereas the other components are expressed more constantly in cells. Although hTERT has a rate-limiting effect on enzyme activity, the other telomerase subunits (hTR, TEP1, hsp90, p23, dyskerin) participated in full enzyme activi'ty. We hypothesize that once hTERT is expressed, all other telomerase subunits can be assembled to form a highly active holoenzyme.

0036498858	Prediction of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in breast carcinoma	Purpose: Supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients has a poor prognosis, and aggressive local treatment has usually resulted in severe morbidity. The purpose of this study was to select high-risk neck metastasis patients for prophylactic radiotherapy. Methods: Between 1990 and 1998, 2658 consecutive invasive breast cancer patients underwent surgery and adjuvant therapy in the hospital. The median age was 47 years (range 22-92). The median follow-up period was 39 months. The following factors were analyzed: age, tumor size, tumor location, histologic type, histologic grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, DNA flow cytometry study results, number of positive axillary lymph nodes, use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, and level of involved axillary nodes. Results: Of the 2658 patients, 113 (4.3%) developed supraclavicular lymph node metastasis during this period. Young age (≤40 years), tumor size >3 cm, high histologic grade, angiolymphatic invasion, negative estrogen receptor status, synthetic phase fraction >4%, >4 positive nodes, and level II or III involved nodes were all significant for predicting neck metastasis in the univariate analysis. Three predictive factors were significant after multivariate analysis: high histologic grade, >4 positive nodes, and axillary level II or III involved nodes. In patients with axillary level I involved nodes and ≤4 positive nodes, the incidence was 4.4%. If axillary level III was involved, the rate of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis was 15.1%. Conclusion: The incidence of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis was higher in the groups with >4 positive nodes and in those with axillary level II or III involved nodes. Selective use of comprehensive radiotherapy for these high-risk patients will achieve good locoregional control. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

79960431337	Molecular chaperones as a common set of proteins that regulate the invasion phenotype of head and neck cancer	Purpose: The goal of this study was to establish a common set of molecules that regulate cell invasion in head and neck cancer (HNC). Experimental Design: Five invasive sublines derived from HNC cell lines were established using the Matrigel selection method. Proteomic technology, MetaCore algorithm, and reverse transcriptase-PCR methods were used to search for molecules that contribute to the invasion phenotype. Cellular functional analyses and clinical association studies were applied to examine the significance of the molecules. Results: Fifty-two proteins were identified in more than two of the four independent proteomic experiments, including 10 (19%) molecular chaperones. Seven chaperones were confirmed to be differentially expressed in five sublines, Hsp90α, Hsp90β, Hsp90-B1/Gp96, Hsp70-A5/Grp78, and HYOU1, that upregulate, whereas Hsp60 and glucosidase-α neutral AB (GANAB) downregulate. Four molecules were further investigated. In all cell lines, knockdown of Hsp60 or GANAB and silencing of Gp96 or Grp78 considerably enhanced or reduced cell migration and invasion, respectively. Clinical association studies consistently revealed that low levels of Hsp60 or GANAB and high levels of Gp96 or Grp78 are significantly associated with advanced cancer (P < 0.001 to P = 0.047, respectively, for the four molecules) and poor survival (P < 0.001 to P = 0.025, respectively, for the four molecules). Conclusion: Our study defined molecular chaperones as a common set of proteins that regulate the invasion phenotype of HNC. Loss of the tumor suppression function of Hsp60 orGANABand acquisition of the oncogenic function of Gp96 or Grp78 contribute to aggressive cancers. These molecules may serve as prognostic markers and targets for cancer drug development. ©2011 AACR.

80053903699	GP96 is over-expressed in oral cavity cancer and is a poor prognostic indicator for patients receiving radiotherapy	Background: Oral cavity cancers (ORC) are the most common cancers, and standard treatment is radical surgery with postoperative radiotherapy. However, locoregional failure remains a major problem, indicating radioresistance an important issue. Our previous work has shown that GP96 contributed to radioresistance in nasopharyngeal and oral cancer cell lines. In this study, we determined clinical significance of GP96 in ORC by evaluation of GP96 expression and its association with disease prognosis in patients receiving radiotherapy. Methods: Total of 79 ORC patients (77 males, median age: 48 years old) receiving radical surgery and postoperative radiotherapy between Oct 1999 and Dec 2004 were enrolled. Patients in pathological stages II, III and IV were 16.5%, 16.5% and 67%, respectively. For each patient, a pair of carcinoma tissue and grossly adjacent normal mucosa was obtained. GP96-expression was examined by western blot analysis, and the association with clinicopathological status was determined.Results: Three-year locoregional control (LRC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 69%, 79%, 63% and 57%, respectively. We found that 55 patients (70%) displayed GP96-overexpression in the tumor tissue, which correlated with a higher pN stage (p = 0.020) and tumor depth (> 10 mm) (p = 0.045). Nodal extracapsular spreading (ECS) and GP96-overexpression predicted adverse LRC (p = 0.049 and p = 0.008). When stratified by nodal ECS, the adverse impact of GP96 remained significant in three-year LRC (p = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, GP96-overexpression was also an independent predictor of LRC, DSS and OS (p = 0.018, p = 0.011 and p = 0.012).Conclusion: GP96 may play roles in radioresistance which attributes to tumor invasiveness in oral cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. GP96 may serve as a novel prognostic marker of radiotherapy. However, further independent studies are required to validate our findings in a larger series. © 2011 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84864853674	Oncogenic function and early detection potential of miRNA-10b in oral cancer as identified by microRNA profiling	The miRNA participates in a variety of biologic processes, and dysregulation of miRNA is associated with malignant transformation. In this study, we determined specific profile of miRNA associated with oral cancer by using miRNA array screening method. There were 23 miRNAs found with considerably differential expressions between six oral cancer cell lines and five lines of normal oral keratinocytes, in which, 10 miRNAs showed the highest significant difference after independent examination by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Eight molecules were upregulated, miR-10b, miR-196a, miR-196b, miR-582-5p, miR-15b, miR-301, miR-148b, and miR-128a, and two molecules, miR-503 and miR-31, were downregulated. The most upregulated miR-10b was further examined, and its functions were characterized in two oral cancer cell lines. The miR-10b actively promotes cell migration (2.6- to 3.6-fold) and invasion (1.7- to 1.9-fold) but has minimal effect on cell growth or chemo-/radiosensitivity. Furthermore, miR-10b was considerably elevated in the plasma of xenografted tumor mice (20-fold). This upregulation of miR-10b in plasma was further shown in the patients with oral cancer [P < 0.0001, area under curve (AUC) = 0.932] and precancer lesions (P < 0.0001, AUC = 0.967), suggesting that miR-10b possesses a high potential to discriminate the normal subjects. In conclusion, we have identified at least 10 miRNAs significantly associated with oral cancer, including the most elevated miR-10b. The miR-10b actively participates in cancer formation by promoting cell migration and invasion. Our study using clinical samples suggests that plasma miR-10b has high potential as an early detection marker for oral cancer. ©2012 AACR.

84865865847	Transoral laser microsurgery elevates fundamental frequency in early glottic cancer	Objective: To evaluate the long-term voice characteristics and quality of life of early glottic cancer patients after definitive treatment. Study Design: Case series with chart review in a tertiary care medical center in Taiwan. Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients who received radiation therapy (RT) or transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for early glottic cancer over 12 months were evaluated for voice laboratory data and quality-of-life measurements. Results: Twenty-four patients received RT, and 18 underwent TLM. There was no difference between the two groups on acoustic and aerodynamic voice measures except for modal fundamental frequency in males. In the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck survey, the TLM group had better communication than the RT group, but there were no differences in voice quality and strength. There was also no significant difference in the Voice Handicap Index 10 evaluation. Conclusions: Male patients who received TLM have higher modal fundamental frequency than male patients who received RT and norms. Voice-related life quality is similar in patients regardless of RT or TLM treatment for early glottic cancer, but those who receive TLM have better communication abilities than those who receive RT. © 2012 The Voice Foundation.

0036867041	A reverse transcription comparative real-time PCR method for quantitative detection of angiogenic growth factors in head and neck cancer patients	Objectives: Head and neck cancer is one of the ten most frequent cancers in the world. The angiogenic growth factors VEGF, PDGF and bFGF play a role in cancer aggressiveness. We developed a sensitive method to quantify the gene expression of these factors in the tissues of head and neck cancer patients. Design and methods: All assays were performed using real-time RT-PCR, which yields a value (Ct) denoting the threshold cycle of PCR amplification at which product is first detected by fluorescence. The Ct is dependent on the quantity of the target molecule in the sample. To control for variation in RNA quantity and quality, we used 18S ribosome RNA as an internal control to calculate a relative Ct for the target molecules of interest, VEGF, PDGF and bFGF. A serially diluted positive control sample was analyzed by linear regression to determine the sensitivity and linearity of the assay. Paired normal and cancerous tissue samples from 115 head and neck cancer patients were assayed to ascertain the relative levels of the growth factors. Results: The CVs of within-run and between-run assays for VEGF, PDGF and bFGF were all less than 3%. The correlation coefficient of the RNA concentrations and Ct values were 0.9987, 0.9977, and 0.9996 respectively for VEGF, PDGF and bFGF. The assay was sensitive to as little as 10

0036869565	Quantitative analysis of multidrug-resistance mdr1 gene expression in head and neck cancer by real-time RT-PCR	Progression of head and neck cancer is always associated with changes of gene expression profile. In this study, we characterized the expression of multidrug-resistance mdr1 gene, which may play a role in tumorigenesis and multidrug resistance in head and neck cancer. A TaqMan one-step RT-PCR with a linear range for quantification across at least a 5 log scale of concentration of mdr1 mRNA was designed to determine the level of mdr1 expression in 50 pairs of normal vs. malignant head and neck tissues. Both the absolute level of mdr1 mRNA in tumor (T) and the relative mdr1 expression between tumor and its normal counterpart (T/N) were measured and their associations with several clinical variables were analyzed. Among the clinical variables analyzed, only the clinical stage of tumor was found to be associated with mdr1 expression. The distribution of clinical stages differed significantly (P<0.01) among the 27 specimens that had a T/N>1, with 59.3%, 22.2%, 14.8% and 3.7% in stage IV, III, II, and I, respectively. In addition, 76% of stage IV and 75% of stage III tumors had a T/N>1 compared to 25% of stage II and 20% of stage 1 tumors (P=0.004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also indicated a significant difference of mdr1 expression between the early (I and II) and advanced (III and IV) stages tumors. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.477 (1.084-2.012) and 1.001 (1.000-1.002) for T/N (P<0.05) and T (P<0.05) treated as continuous variables, and 15.521 (3.414-70.550) and 5.074 (1.154-22.311) for T/N (P<0.001) and T (P<0.05) treated as binary variables, respectively. Taken together, the data presented here indicated that real-time RT-PCR provides a quantitative way to monitor mdr1 gene expression. The differential expression of mdr1 between early and advanced stages of head and neck cancer may shed light on the process of tumorigenicity and offer clues to the planning of new treatments.

0037947325	The XRCC1 399Gln polymorphism and the frequency of p53 mutations in Taiwanese oral squamous cell carcinomas	DNA repair gene polymorphisms have been implicated as susceptibility factors in cancer development. It is possible that DNA repair polymorphisms may also influence the risk of gene mutation. The 399Gln polymorphism in the DNA repair gene XRCC1 has been indicated to have a contributive role in DNA adduct formation, sister chromatid exchange, and an increased risk of cancer development. Two hundred thirty-seven male oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) were included in a study to investigate the role of the XRCC1 194Trp, 280His, and 399Gln polymorphisms on p53 gene mutation. PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing were used to analyze the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9). The XRCC1 genotype was determined by PCR-RFLP. Nineteen (8.02%) of the 237 OSCCs had a Gln/Gln genotype. One hundred six (43.88%) of the 237 OSCCs showed p53 gene mutations at exons 5-9. The OSCC patients with a Gln/Gln genotype exhibited a significantly higher frequency of p53 mutation than those with an Arg/Gln and an Arg/Arg genotype. After adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, areca quid chewing, and alcohol drinking, the Gln/Gln genotype still showed an independent association with the frequency of p53 mutation (odd ratio, 4.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-13.36). The findings support the hypothesis that XRCC1 Arg399Gln amino acid change may alter the phenotype of the XRCC1 protein, resulting in a DNA repair deficiency. This study also suggests an important role for the XRCC1 399Gln polymorphism in p53 gene mutation in Taiwanese OSCCs.

84866871386	Association of HPV infections with second primary tumors in early-staged oral cavity cancer	Objective: The infection of human papilloma virus (HPV) has been reported in head and neck cancer; however, the clinical significance of HPV infection on the pathogenesis of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is still uncertain. Materials and Methods: The study recruited 103 patients with pathological early-stage OSCC between March 1997 and December 2003 from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Tumor specimens were HPV-genotyped by the EasychipVR HPV Blot method. Clinical association study was performed by using chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, and logrank tests. Results: Thirty-one patients (30.1%) were positive for HPV infection. The most frequent HPV types were types 16 (16 patients, 51.6%) and 18 (seven patients, 22.6%). HPV infection was not associated with tumor aggressiveness (pathological tumor stage or differentiation status), risk exposure (alcohol, cigarette, or areca quid chewing habit), or the treatment outcome (disease-free survival or overall survival). However, infection with HPV-18 was associated with the occurrence of a second primary cancers (P=0.033), indicating the infection of HPV in OSCC enhances the susceptibility of developing secondary malignancy. Conclusions: There are 30% of the patients with OSCC infected with HPV, with most high-risk types. HPV-18 infection may enhance the susceptibility of second primary tumors. Large scale of validation study will be needed to confirm this result. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84878499360	DSG3 Facilitates Cancer Cell Growth and Invasion through the DSG3-Plakoglobin-TCF/LEF-Myc/Cyclin D1/MMP Signaling Pathway	Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) is a component of the desmosome, which confers strong cell-cell adhesion. Previously, an oncogenic function of DSG3 has been found in head neck cancer (HNC). Here, we investigated how this molecule contributes to the malignant phenotype. Because DSG3 is associated with plakoglobin, we examined whether these phenotypic alterations were mediated through the plakoglobin molecule. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining revealed that DSG3 silencing disrupted its interaction with plakoglobin and induced plakoglobin translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Knockdown of DSG3 significantly increased the interaction of plakoglobin with the transcriptional factor TCF and suppressed the TCF/LEF transcriptional activity. These effects further conferred to reduced expression of the TCF/LEF downstream target genes, including c-myc, cyclin D1, and MMP-7. Functional analyses showed that DSG3 silencing reduced cell growth and arrested cells at G0/G1 phase. Besides, cell migration and invasion abilities were also decreased. These cellular results were confirmed using tumor xenografts in mice, as DSG3 silencing led to the suppressed tumor growth, plakoglobin translocation and reduced expression of TCF/LEF target genes in tumors. Therefore, our study shows that the desmosomal protein DSG3 additionally functions to regulate malignant phenotypes via nuclear signaling. In conclusion, we found that DSG3 functions as an oncogene and facilitates cancer growth and invasion in HNC cells through the DSG3-plakoglobin-TCF/LEF pathway. © 2013 Chen et al.

84881352986	Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MR Imaging Predicts Local Control in Oropharyngeal or Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treated with Chemoradiotherapy	The role of pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging (DCE-PWI) and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in predicting the treatment response of oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OHSCC) to chemoradiation remains unclear. We prospectively investigated the ability of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from pretreatment DCE-PWI and DWI to predict the local control of OHSCC patients treated with chemoradiation. Between August, 2010 and March, 2012, patients with untreated OHSCC scheduled for chemoradiation were eligible for this prospective study. DCE-PWI and DWI were performed in addition to conventional MRI. The relationship of local control with the following clinical and imaging variables was analyzed: the hemoglobin level, T-stage, tumor location, gross tumor volume, maximum standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis on FDG PET/CT, transfer constant (K

84885096858	The health-related quality of life and bio-psycho-social adaptation effects in patients with head and neck cancer: A longitudinal study	Background: Because of the therapies and methods involved in its treatment, head and neck cancer patients often face unpredictable changes in both quality of life (QoL) and psychological status over the long course of their disease. Most studies have used fixed-term measurements that do not consider time variance and its effects. To facilitate medical communication and rehabilitation interventions, we investigated changes in HNC (head and neck cancer) patients' bio-psycho-social status and QoL over time. Purposes: This study examines QoL growth patterns and the bio-psycho-social adaptation effect in HNC patients as well as how various variables affect within-individual and between-individual level factors during the 4 stages of HNC. Methods: A total of 109 HNC patients participated in this study. Two hundred and fifty-seven valid questionnaires were gathered. Questionnaires were given to each patient at 4 times: initial disease diagnosis; during the therapy period; 3 months after therapy; and 6 months after therapy. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical linear models were used in data analysis. Results: The main results revealed that: (1) degree of mood disturbance decreased linearly as illness stage progressed. Age, gender, religion, and job impacted patients' initial status, while gender, cancer stage, and education degree were significant moderators of the rate at which a participant's adaptation effect grew; (2) patient QoL showed no significant difference over time. Age and job were significant impact factors affecting patients' initial status. Cancer stage, educational degree, and marital status had a significant moderating effect on the growth rate of participants' adaptation effect score. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Our results indicate that participants in this study had a higher level of anxiety and depression than the average population and that their QoL was negatively influenced by the side effects of their therapy. Therefore, study findings recommend that timely psycho-social intervention and side-effect education should be reinforced to enhance patients' quality of life.

84886846969	Refining the role of preoperative C-reactive protein by neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma	Objectives/Hypothesis Elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and the recently identified neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were demonstrated to be associated with prognosis in human cancers. The aim of our present study is to analyze the relationship of preoperative levels of CRP and NLR with clinicopathological factors and prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. Study Design Retrospective study. Methods This study was performed on 226 OSCC patients between July 2007 and April 2012. Their serum CRP levels and NLR were measured preoperatively. Results CRP level ≥ 5.0 mg/L was significantly associated with NLR ≥ 2.44 (linear regression, P <.001). Elevated CRP and NLR were significantly associated with pathological tumor status (P <.001), pathologic nodal metastasis (P <.001), tumor depth (≥10 mm vs. <10 mm, P <.001), disease-free survival (P <.001), and overall survival (P =.001). The influence of CRP level and NLR on disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.259, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.170-4.361) and overall survival (HR = 2.176, 95% CI = 1.116-4.245]) still existed after adjusting for tumor status, lymph node metastasis, and tumor cell differentiation. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that elevated CRP is an independent prognostic factor in OSCC. Elevated NLR in the high CRP group identifies patients at high risks of recurrence and shorter survival. Incorporating NLR into CRP level therefore has significant potential as a biomarker for risk stratification in OSCC.

0041733629	Prognostic significance of EGFR and Her-2 in oral cavity cancer in betel quid prevalent area	Although several studies have found overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) proteins EGFR and Her-2 in head and neck cancers, the clinical relevance of the finding varies. We examined the expression and clinical association of these molecules with oral squamous cell carcinoma in an area where betel chewing is prevalent. EGFR and Her-2 proteins were measured in 59 paired (grossly normal and cancer) tissues by an enzyme immunoassy method. The cutoff value for gene overexpression was defined as the level of mean expression in normal tissue plus two s.d. A total of 59% of the patients consumed alcohol, 90% smoked tobacco, and 90% chewed betel quid. Of the patients assayed, 34 (58%) and 24 (41%) had EGFR and Her-2 overexpression, with average 3.5-and 1.5-fold elevations. EGFR overexpression has been shown to be statistically associated with T stage, N stage, overall TMN stage, primary tumour depth, lymph node extra-capsular spread, and poor survival. Her-2 overexpression, however, did not demonstrate a similar association with clinicopathological parameters or therapeutic outcome. On multivariant analysis, EGFR overexpression (P = 0.041) and N stage (P = 0.024) were the only independent factors for overall survival. These results indicate that the molecular targeting therapy to EGFR may be a treatment for oral cavity cancer in the betel quid-chewing prevalent area. © 2003 Cancer Research UK.

0141918830	Radiotherapy of early-stage glottic cancer: Analysis of factors affecting prognosis	This study is a retrospective analysis of 134 patients treated with radiotherapy at our hospital. The sample included 88 stage T1 and 46 stage T2 patients. Sixty-two patients had anterior commissure involvement, 37 patients had impaired vocal cord mobility, and 24 patients had supraglottic or subglottic extension. Irradiation was given, with the dose ranging from 60 to 72 Gy. Laryngectomy was the main salvage treatment for local recurrence. The 5-year initial and final local control rates were 71% and 83%, and the 10-year initial and final local control rates were 69% and 80%, comparable to the results of other series. The 5-year rate of overall survival with final larynx preservation was 77%. Multivariate analysis revealed that anterior commissure involvement is prognostic of a poor outcome in patients with T1 glottic cancer. Further subgroup analysis revealed that a fraction size of >200 cGy could overcome the negative impact of anterior commissure involvement and significantly improve the 5-year local control rate in T1 patients (100% at >200 cGy versus 45% at ≤200 cGy; p = .04). Subglottic extension of the glottic cancer predicted poor outcome in T2 patients. The 5-year local control rates of patients with and without subglottic extension were 9% and 77%, respectively (p < .001). According to our results, radiotherapy with a fraction size of >200 cGy is recommended for T 1 disease with anterior commissure involvement. For patients with T2 disease and subglottic extension, radiotherapy alone produces poor results. Further improvement of outcomes by other treatment strategies needs to be investigated.

0242511765	Lack of Correlation of Betel Nut Chewing, Tobacco Smoking, and Alcohol Consumption with Telomerase Activity and the Severity of Oral Cancer	Background: Oral cancer is one of the most frequent cancers. A strong association has been found between oral cancer incidence and the use of betel nut, alcohol, and tobacco. Telomerase activity (TA) has also been shown to play a role in carcinogenesis. We therefore surveyed the consumption habits of betel nut chewing, alcohol drinking, and tobacco smoking in oral cancer patients and evaluated the association of these habits with TA level and clinical stage. Methods: In total, 154 oral cancer patients were recruited. TA was measured in paired (grossly normal and cancerous) tissues using a polymerase chain reaction-based enzyme immunoassay. Associations of these factors with clinical stage and TA level were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square test. Results: In these patients, 86.4%, 61.0%, and 83.3% used betel nut, alcohol, and tobacco, respectively. For all tissue assayed, 80.5% of cancerous and 3.2% of grossly normal mucosae were positive for TA. However, neither clinical stage nor TA level in cancerous tissues had a statistical association with the use of individual substances (betel nut, alcohol, and tobacco) or their combined use. Conclusion: Even though the habitual uses of these substances have been previously reported to be associated with oral cancer incidence, we found a lack of correlation with TA level or with disease severity in our study. These results imply that these consumption habits might only be associated with the early stages of oral cancer development, while the later stages of cancer progression may be more associated with other external factors or dependent on host cellular factors, all of which require confirmation through further investigations.

0345827757	Surgical Treatment of Oral Verrucous Carcinoma	Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with Verrucous carcinoma (VC) of oral cavity treated at the Chung Gung Memory Hospital with respect to the tumor control rates after surgery, the risk of lymph node metastasis and the role of radiation therapy. Methods: Thirty-eight patients underwent primary treatment for VC of the oral cavity from January 1996 through February 2002. All of the patients had surgery as their primary treatment. In addition, all patients with sufficient details of the therapy and a minimum 1-year follow-up were selected for evaluation of survival and outcomes. Results: In this study, 94.7% of patients were male and most of them had been exposed to betel nuts, cigarettes, and/or alcohol. The most common site was the buccal mucosa (57.9%), followed by the tongue (13.2%). T3 lesions were the most common type (34.2%). Only two patients had palpable cervical adenopathy during the initial evaluation. Twenty-five patients had free flap for reconstruction. The tumor control rate was 100%. At the time of analysis, no patient had suffered from recurrence in primary site or neck area. Conclusion: Surgical excision alone was effective for controlling VC, but elective neck dissection was not necessary even in patients in the advanced stages.

84893759373	Prognostic value of prepontine cistern invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy	Objectives: To investigate the prognostic value of prepontine cistern invasion (PPCI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Materials and methods: Five hundred and four non-disseminated NPC patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination before radical IMRT between November 2000 and December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnostic criteria for PPCI were tumor invasion through the posterior cortex of clivus and extension into the prepontine cistern. Results: The median follow-up of the patients in this study was 63.5 months. PPCI was found in 44 patients (25% of T4 patients). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) of all patients, with and without PPCI, were 44.3% and 70.5% (p < 0.001), 84.4% and 89.1% (p = 0.376), 66.6% and 87.3% (p < 0.001), and 59.6% and 80.2% (p < 0.001), respectively. In T4 patients with PPCI and without PPCI, the 5-year PFS, LC, DMFS, and OS were 44.3% and 62.5% (p = 0.023), 84.4% and 84.9% (p = 0.946), 66.6% and 83.1% (p = 0.022), and 59.6% and 71.0% (p = 0.045), respectively. Using multivariate analysis, PPCI was found to be an independent poor prognostic factor for PFS (HR = 1.816; p = 0.007), DMFS (HR = 1.928; p = 0.045), and OS (HR = 1.798; p = 0.016). Conclusion: Prepontine cistern invasion was an independent prognostic factor for poor DMFS and OS but not LC in NPC patients treated with IMRT, even within T4 patients. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84896134947	Postoperative concomitant chemoradiotherapy improved treatment outcomes of patients with oral cavity cancer with multiple-node metastases but no other major risk factors	Purpose: To investigate the results of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for the treatment of pathologic N2b/c squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC). Materials and Methods: This study reviewed cancer registry data collected in our hospital from 1998 to 2009 with the following inclusion criteria: primary OSCC, treatment with radical surgery, and multiple nodal metastases. Patients who had extracapsular spreading of the lymph node metastases or positive resection margins or who refused to undergo PORT were excluded. The prescribed dose of PORT was 60-66 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was optional. Patient characteristics, treatment parameters and clinical outcome were recorded. The primary end point was overall survival, and the secondary endpoint was disease status. Results: There were 138 eligible cases, and the median follow-up period was 35 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 56%. Univariate analysis revealed that pathologic T4 status (pT4), bone marrow invasion, and lymphatic invasion were significantly correlated with poor outcome (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that pT4, lymphatic invasion, and the no concurrent chemotherapy were independent poor prognostic factors (p<0.05). Fifty-four patients had tumor recurrence. The 3-year recurrence-free survival rate was 59%. Skin invasion, pT4, and bone marrow invasion were correlated with poor prognosis in the univariate analysis (p<0.05). Only pT4 (p<0.01) and no concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0.03) were independently correlated with poor recurrence-free survival. Conclusion: For OSCC patients with multiple-node metastases without extracapsular spreading or positive resection margins, PORT without concurrent chemotherapy correlated to inferior outcome. Multiple lymph node metastases might be considered an indication for concurrent chemotherapy. © 2014 Fan et al.

84908093401	OncomiR-196 promotes an invasive phenotype in oral cancer through the NME4-JNK-TIMP1-MMP signaling pathway	Background: MicroRNA-196 (miR-196), which is highly up-regulated in oral cancer cells, has been reported to be aberrantly expressed in several cancers; however, the significance of miR-196 in oral cancer has not yet been addressed.Methods: Cellular functions in response to miR-196 modulation were examined, including cell growth, migration, invasion and radio/chemosensitivity. Algorithm-based studies were used to identify the regulatory target of miR-196. The miR-196 target gene and downstream molecular mechanisms were confirmed by RT-qPCR, western blot, luciferase reporter and confocal microscopy analyses. miR-196 expression was determined in paired cancer and adjacent normal tissues from oral cancer patients.Results: Both miR-196a and miR-196b were highly over-expressed in the cancer tissue and correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). Functionally, miR-196 actively promoted cell migration and invasion without affecting cell growth. Mechanistically, miR-196 performed it's their function by inhibiting NME4 expression and further activating p-JNK, suppressing TIMP1, and augmenting MMP1/9.Conclusion: miR-196 contributes to oral cancer by promoting cell migration and invasion. Clinically, miR-196a/b was significantly over-expressed in the cancer tissues and correlated with lymph node metastasis. Thus, our findings provide new knowledge of the underlying mechanism of cancer metastasis. miR-196 may serve as a promising marker for better oral cancer management.

However, with positive FDG uptake in the contiguous paranasal sinus, it may be difficult to differentiate tumor invasion from an inflammatory process. We describe such a patient with NPC in whom an FDG PET scan revealed intense FDG uptake in and above the nasopharynx, suggesting tumor invasion in the sphenoethmoid sinuses. After fusion PET/CT imaging, sphenoethmoid sinusitis rather than tumor invasion was noted. This patient achieved complete remission after current chemoradiotherapy.

13244299116	p53 polymorphisms associated with mutations in and loss of heterozygosity of the p53 gene in male oral squamous cell carcinomas in Taiwan	The present study was designed to examine whether different p53 haplotypes of exon 4-intron 3-intron 6 affect the frequency of mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the p53 gene in male oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) in Taiwan. We found that individuals without two Pro-W-G alleles had significantly higher frequency of p53 mutations than those with two Pro-W-G alleles (odds ratio (OR)= 1.98; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-3.56). Out of the 172 p53 gene exon 4 informative male OSCCs, 72 (41.9%) showed LOH. Among these 72 OSCCs with LOH, the frequency of Pro allele loss was 73.6% (53/72). It is notable that alcohol drinking increased the frequency of Arg allele loss (OR = 10.56; 95% CI, 1.23-234.94) in OSCCs from patients who both smoked cigarettes and chewed areca quid (AQ). The frequency of LOH of p53 was not different between p53-mutated OSCCs and p53-normal OSCCs. Thus, the present study revealed that (a) the Arg allele is associated with p53 mutations, (b) the Pro allele is preferentially lost in OSCCs associated with cigarette smoking and AQ chewing, while the frequency of Arg allele loss is increased with alcohol drinking, and (c) haploinsufficiency of p53 is in itself likely to contribute to tumour progression in Taiwanese OSCCs. © 2005 Cancer Research UK.
