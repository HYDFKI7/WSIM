2042474731	Studies on moving object segmentation based on information fusion in video sequences	A method of extracting moving object is proposed by utilizing the information fusion. Color image segmentation primarily uses a non-parametric clustering method based on partial space information intervening iterative mean shift procedure. A way of finding connected areas with identical marks is introduced to divide the image into different independent areas. HOS (Higher-Order Statistics) is used for motion detection. Then through post-processing, A rough motion template can be got. In such a template, the ratio of regions with identical marks to the corresponding independent region in the original image can be computed. If the ratio is larger than a predetermined threshold, the corresponding independent region will be fused. Finally, the moving object can be extracted by fusing all the predetermined regions.

33645773645	Identification of candidate tumor suppressor genes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at chromosome 6q16.3-21 in China	In order to identify candidate tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), firstly, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 6q16.3-21 in 139 primary ALL samples was analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 11 microsatellite markers. The frequency of LOH on 6q16.3-21 was 32%. A 2-cM high frequency deletion region was flanked by D6S1709 and D6S301 loci at 6q16.3-21. Clinical data showed that patient with 6q16.3-21 LOH had higher WBC counts and blast cells (P < 0.05). The statistics about age, sex, classification of morphology and immunology were indistinct (P > 0.05). Then, positional cloning strategy, bioinformatics technology and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to identify candidate TSGs and its cDNA fragments at 6q16.3-21, especially at the high frequency deletion region. Comparing with expression of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell, EST screened in D6S1709-D6S301 (GenBank Accession No.AA403058) was down-regulation in ten of fifteen childhood ALL (P < 0.05). Digital differential display showed that the expression levels of AMD1, PPIL6 and WASF1 were lower in cancer tissues than in normal tissues (P < 0.05). These findings may provide new clues in cloning of childhood ALL TSGs at 6q16.3-21.

33749233824	Activation of Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase 1 (ROCK-1) by caspase-3 cleavage plays an essential role in cardiac myocyte apoptosis	Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase 1 (ROCK-1) is a direct cleavage substrate of activated caspase-3, which is associated with heart failure. In the course of human heart failure, we found marked cleavage of ROCK-1 resulting in a 130-kDa subspecies, which was absent in normal hearts and in an equivalent cohort of patients with left ventricular assist devices. Murine cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin led to enhanced ROCK-1 cleavage and apoptosis, all of which was blocked by a caspase-3 inhibitor. In addition, a bitransgenic mouse model of severe cardiomyopathy, which overexpresses Gq protein and hematopoietic progenitor kinase-/germinal center kinase-like kinase, revealed the robust accumulation of the 130-kDa ROCK-1 cleaved fragment. This constitutively active ROCK-1 subspecies, when expressed in cardiomyocytes, led to caspase-3 activation, indicating a positive feed-forward regulatory loop. ROCK-1-dependent caspase-3 activation was coupled with the activation of PTEN and the subsequent inhibition of protein kinase B (Akt) activity, all of which was attenuated by siRNA directed against ROCK-1 expression. Similarly, ROCK-1-null mice (Rock-1-

34548307075	Effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy administered at different time on white matter damage following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in neonatal rats	Objective: A recent study has suggested that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy administered within 3 hrs following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) may alleviate brain white matter damage (WMD) in neonatal rats. However it is unclear whether a delayed HBO therapy (more than 3 hrs following HIBD) has neuroprotective effects in neonatal rats. This study aimed to explore the effect of HBO therapy administered at different time points following HIBD on WMD in neonatal rats. Methods: The HIBD model was prepared according to the Rice-Vannucci procedure in 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. HBO therapy was administered at 3, 6, 12, 24 or 72 hrs after HIBD, once daily for consecutive 7 days. T-maze test, the foot-fault test and the radial arm maze test were performed after 14 days of HIBD. Myelin basic protein (MBP) in the callositas and corpora striata was examined by immunohistochemical method 28 days after HIBD. Results: The rats receiving HBO therapy at 3, 6 and 12 hrs after HIBD performed significantly better in the T-maze test, the radial arm maze test and the foot-fault test than the untreated HIBD rats. There were no significant differences in the behavioral test results between the HBO-treated groups administered HBO at 24 and 72 hrs after HIBD and the untreated HIBD group. The MBP expression in the HBO-treated groups treated within 12 hrs after HIBD was significantly higher than that in the untreated HIBD group (P < 0. 05). When the HBO therapeutic window was delayed to 24 hrs after HIBD, there were no significant differences in the MBP expression between the HBO-treated and the untreated HIBD groups. Conclusions: HBO therapy administered within 12 hrs following HIBD can alleviate brain WMD in neonatal rats, but the efficacy of HBO therapy administered 24 hrs after HIBD does not appear to be satisfactory.

35148829949	Proliferation of neural stem cells correlates with Wnt-3 protein in hypoxic-ischemic neonate rats after hyperbaric oxygen therapy	Hyperbaric oxygen therapy promoted brain cell proliferation. Wnt-3 is closely associated with the proliferation of neural stem cells. We examined whether hyperbaric oxygen promoted neural stem cells to proliferate and its correlation with Wnt-3 protein in hypoxic-ischemic neonate rats. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was administered 3 h after hypoxia ischemia daily for 7 days. The proliferating stem cells and Wnt-3 protein were examined dynamically in the subventricular zone. Results showed that stem cells proliferated and peaked 7 days after hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Wnt-3 protein increased to the higher levels 3 days after therapy. Linear regression analysis showed that nestin protein correlated with Wnt-3 protein. We propose that hyperbaric oxygen treatment promote stem cells to proliferate, which is correlated with Wnt-3 protein. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

36448960164	ERK1/2 signaling pathway modulates the airway smooth muscle cell phenotype in the rat model of chronic asthma	Background: It has been demonstrated that the phenotypic modulation of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) is important to the pathogenesis of airway remodeling in chronic asthma. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway is one of the most important transduction pathways involved in the process of asthma; however, its role in the phenotypic transition of ASMCs remains unclear. Objectives: To examine the role of ERK1/2 in the phenotypic modulation of ASMCs in the rat model of chronic asthma. Methods: Bronchial smooth muscle strips were cultured in vitro in the presence of the ERK1/2 agonist epidermal growth factor or/and the MEK inhibitor PD98059. The phenotype of ASMCs was determined by observing these cells under an electron microscope and analyzing expression of phenotypic markers (smooth muscle α-actin for the contractile phenotype and osteopontin for the synthetic) by using Western blot and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results: The phenotype of the ASMCs from the chronic asthmatic rats changed from the contractile type to the synthetic type with synthetic organelles abundantly gathered around the nucleus and altered expression of phenotypic markers. ERK1/2 was strongly expressed in the ASMCs of the chronic asthmatic rats and its activation by epidermal growth factor excessively promoted the synthetic function of ASMCs; the MEK inhibitor PD98059, however, reversed this phenotypic change in the ASMCs. Conclusions: Our results reveal a key role of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the phenotypic modulation of ASMCs in chronic asthmatic rats, indicating that specific inhibition of ERK1/2 in ASMCs may be therapeutically valuable in the control of airway remodeling in chronic asthma.

38349105611	Role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway in regulating the secretion of bronchial smooth muscle cells in a rat model of chronic asthma	Background: Although it is recognized that bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) play a key role in airway remodeling during chronic asthma, it is not well understood how BSMCs exert their inflammatory functions. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway is an important signaling pathway in chronic asthma, but its influence on secretion by BSMCs has not been well-studied. We investigated the impact of ERK1/2 signaling pathway on secretion by BSMCs in a rat model of chronic asthma in this study. Methods: To create a rat model of chronic asthma, Wistar rats underwent ovalbumim (OVA) injection and eight weeks of inhalation. BSMCs were isolated and cultured in vitro. Epidermal growth factor, PD98059 and ERK1/2 antisense oligonucleotide were used to explore the role of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The expression of P-ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) in BSMCs was analyzed by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Secretion of BSMCs was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Phospho-ERK1/2 expression was increased in BSMCs of chronic asthmatic rats compared with the controls. PD98059 inhibited expression of phospho-ERK1/2 protein, while treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide inhibited the expression of P-ERK1/2 mRNA and protein. BSMCs obtained from the chronic asthma group secreted significantly greater quantities of growth factors (transforming growth factor (TGF)-β

Methods: Forty-eight 7-day-old Spraque-Dawley rats underwent ligation of the left common carotid artery and exposure to 8% oxygen at 37°C for 2 hours to establish HIBD models and then were randomly divided into 4 equal groups 3 days later: HIBD control group, HIBD + cortex transplantation group (CT group) undergoing NSC transplantation into the sensorimotor cortex, HIBD + hippocampus transplantation group (HT group) undergoing NSC transplantation into the hippocampus, and HIBD + ventricle transplantation group (HT group), undergoing NSC transplantation into the lateral ventricle. Since the rats were 40-day-old, they underwent radial maze water-seeking test and 4 sensorimotor tests. Then the brains of the rats were taken out to undergo histological examination by Nissl staining and immunohistochemistry to observer the 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) expression. Results: The times the rats took to find the water in all 3 arms of the maze were arranged form short to long in the order HT group < VT group < CT group < HIBD group with significant differences between the HT, VT, and CT groups and HIBD group (All P < 0.05) and between the groups HT and VT and the group CT (both P < 0.05). The results of the 4 sensorimotor tests were arranged from the best to the worst in the order CT group > VT group > HT group > HIBD group with significant differences between the groups CT and VT and the group HIBD (both P < 0.05). Nissl staining showed that the number of normal neurons in the cortex area from more to less were arranged in the order CT group > VT group > HT group > HIBD group; and the number of normal neurons in the CAI area from more to less were arranged in the order HT group > VT group > CT group > HIBD group. Conclusion: Transplantation of NSC attenuates the brain damage and the cognitive and sensorimotor dysfunction after HIBD. Transplantation into the lateral ventricle is the most effective.

34247486165	The immunobiological development of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the course of neuronal differentiation	The central nervous system (CNS) has been referred to as the "immunological privileged site". However, it is now clear that the privileged status of the CNS is a result of a balance between immune privilege and effective response. In vitro, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to differentiate into neurons. Based on this biological attribute we gain the possibility by means of using MSCs as the donors to develop a future cell therapy in clinical application. But using MSCs as donor cells inevitably raises the question as to whether these donor cells would be immunogenic, and if so, would they be rejected after transplantation. To investigate this, human MSCs were cultured in vitro and induced to differentiate along neuronal lineage. The expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II molecules and the co-stimulatory protein CD80 were increased on the surface of MSCs in the course of neuronal differentiation. But neither of the co-stimulatory proteins, CD40 or CD86, was expressed. After IFN-γ exposure, the expression of the HLA molecules was further enhanced, but the co-stimulatory proteins were unaffected. MSCs that had been differentiated along neuronal lineage were not capable of inducing the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Even after IFN-γ exposure, PBLs remained unresponsive. Furthermore, MSCs differentiated along neuronal lineage suppressed the proliferation of PBLs induced by allogeneic PBLs and mitogens. The mechanisms involved in the immunosuppression may be related to the effect of soluble factors and cell-cell interactions of neuronal differentiated MSCs and PBLs. From the above data we suggested that the low immunogenicity and immunomodulatory function of MSCs in the course of neuronal differentiation in vitro, which will be helpful to further investigation in order to establish the new way for future medical application. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Ad-VEGF recombinant adenovirus was constructed by bacterial homologous recombination technology. Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: sham-operated (n = 20), HIBD (n = 25), buffer-treated (n = 20), and Ad-VEGF-treated (n = 25). The HIBD model was prepared by permanent occlusion of left common carotid artery, followed by exposure to 8 % oxygen for 2 hrs. In the Ad-VEGF-treated and the Buffer-treated groups, 2 μL recombinant adenovirus suspension or buffer was injected into the left sensorimotor cortex of the rat brain 3 days after HIBD. Seven days after transplantation, VEGF165 mRNA expression was detected using RT-PCR. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate nickel end labeling (TUNEL). CD34 and VEGF protein were detected using immunohistochemistry. Microvascular density in the cerebral cortex was measured based on CD34 positive cells. A radial arm maze test was performed from 30 postnatal days to evaluate long-term learning and memory functions. At 35 postnatal days, the rats were sacrificed for cerebral histological examinations by hematoxylin and eosin. Results: The expression of VEGF165 mRNA increased in the Ad-VEGF-treated group more than in the untreated HIBD and the buffer-treated groups (P <0. 05). The number of apoptotic neurons was less in the Ad-VEGF-treated group compared with that in the untreated HIBD and the buffer-treated groups (P <0. 05). Microvascular density and VEGF positive cells increased in the Ad-VEGF-treated group compared with that in the untreated HIBD and the buffer-treated groups (P <0. 05). In the radial arm maze test, the Ad-VEGF-treated group had more improved achievements than the HIBD and the buffer groups (P <0. 05). Neuronal degeneration and necrosis were lessened in the Ad-VEGF-treated group compared with the HIBD and the buffer groups. Conclusions: Ad-VEGF gene transfer can increase the expression of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein, decrease neuronal apoptosis, and increase angiopoiesis in the brain. This attenuates brain damage and improves long-term learning and memory functions in neonatal rats after HIBD.

Methods MRC-5 cultured in vitro were individed into 4 groups, including normoxia control, hypoxia, hypoxia and staurosporine (SP), hypoxia and erigeron breviscapus. The expression of hypoxiainducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), pro-collal and phospho-smad2 (p-smad2) were evaluated by Western blot. The level of collagen type I , MMP1 and TIMP1 in supernatant fluid were detected by ELISA. Results Expressed procoll α1, p-smad2 in MRC-5 cells under nomoxia were detected, but not HIF-1α. A low level of.collagen type I , MMP1 and TIMP1 was also detected in the cell supernatant. In nomoxia secreted pro-collα1, p-smad2, collagen type I , MMP1 and TIMP1, hardly secreted HIF-1α. Under hypoxia, the expression of all of them was increased when compared with those of under nomoxia condition (P<0. 05). MMP1 expression was significantly further upregluted by pre-cubation with SP in hypoxia, however collagen type I , TIMP1 in supernatant fluid and pro-collal, p-smad2 in cells were inhibited (P<0. 05, vs. hypoxia group). Treated with Erigeron breviscapus (12. 5 μg/mL, 50 μzg/mL) under hypoxia condition, significantly reduced expression of pro-collal, p-smad2, HIF-1α in MRC-5 cells and collagen type I , MMP1, TIMP1 in supernatant fluid were observed (P<0. 05, vs. hypoxia). Conclusion Erigeron breviscapus can decrase the expression of HIF-1α of MRC-5 cells under hypoxia condition by inhibit the expression of collagen type I and TIMP1 partly through the Smad2 signaling pathways.

45849096511	BMPR IA downstream genes related to VSD	Cardiac-specific deletion of the receptor IA of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) (ALK3) by Cre recombinase driven under the α-MHC promoter is lethal in mid-gestation with defects in the interventricular septum [ventricular septum defect (VSD)]. Analysis of expression of the ALK3 downstream genes is important to identify the signaling pathway for interventricular septum development. The mRNA expression level of a control group was compared with that of a test group. ALK3 downstream genes were screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-select cDNA subtraction and microarray. It was found that the mice with an ALK3 knockout gene produced a VSD. The expression of some genes such as platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF) and Pax-8 was down-regulated in the test group. Pax-8 gene expression was down-regulated by 7.1 times in the test group and expressed specifically in the 11.5-d embryonic (E11.5) heart. Furthermore, the expression of the protein-tyrosine kinase of the focal adhesion kinase subfamily (PTK) and β subtype protein 14-3-3 was up-regulated in the test group. PTK gene expression was up-regulated by 3.7 times in the test group. These data provided support that the ALK3 gene plays an important role during heart development. The PAF and Pax-8 genes could be important ALK3 downstream genes in the BMP signaling pathway during interventricular septum development. PTK and β subtype protein 14-3-3 might be regulatory factors in this pathway. Copyright © 2008 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

54049157903	Phosphorylation of Thr-178 and Thr-184 in the TAK1 T-loop is required for interleukin (IL)-1-mediated optimal NFκB and AP-1 activation as well as IL-6 gene expression	TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, is activated by various cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1). However, the precise regulation for TAK1 activation at the molecular level is still not fully understood. Here we report that dual phosphorylation of Thr-178 and Thr-184 residues within the kinase activation loop of TAK1 is essential for TAK1-mediated NFκB and AP-1 activation. Once co-overexpressed with TAB1, TAK1 mutant with alanine substitution of these two residues fails to activate IKKβ-mediated NFκB and JNK-mediated AP-1, whereas TAK1 mutant with replacement of these two sites with acidic residues acts like the TAK1 wild type. Consistently, TAK1 mutant with alanine substitution of these two residues severely inhibits IL-1-induced NFκB and AP-1 activities, whereas TAK1 mutant with replacement of these two sites with acidic residues slightly enhances IL-1-induced NFκB and AP-1 activities compared with the TAK1 wild-type. IL-1 induces the phosphorylation of endogenous TAK1 at Thr-178 and Thr-184. Reconstitution of TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with wild-type TAK1 or a TAK1 mutant containing threonine 178 and 184 to alanine mutations revealed the importance of these two sites in IL-1-mediated IKK-NFκB and JNK-AP-1 activation as well as IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression. Our finding is the first report that substitution of key serine/threonine residues with acidic residues mimics the phosphorylated state of TAK1 and renders TAK1 active during its induced activation. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Methods: Real-time PCR was used for detecting WAVE1 and p22phox expression in PBMCs in 41 children with ALL and 10 normal controls. Plasma activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was measured by the xanthine oxidase method. Plasma activity of GSH-Px was measured by the DTNB reaction test. Results: The expression of WAVE1 and p22phox was significantly higher in the active ALL groups (newly diagnosed and relapse ALL) than that in the normal control and the complete remission (CR) ALL groups (P < 0.01). The CR ALL group showed increased WAVE1 and p22phox expression than those in the normal control group (P < 0.05). Plasma activities of SOD (22.62 ± 7.39 U/mL) and GSH-Px (91.73 ± 28.88 μmol/L) in the active ALL group were significantly lower than those in the normal control (166.35 ± 27.93 U/mL and 490.94 ± 39.38 μmol/L, respectively) and the CR ALL groups (107.11 ± 28.57 U/ mL and 267.56 ± 82.64 μmol/L, respectively) (P < 0.01). WAVE1 expression was positively correlated with p22phox expression (r = 0. 34, P < 0.05) but negatively correlated with plasma activities of SOD and GSH-Px (r = -0.336 and -0.408, respectively; P < 0.05). Conclusions: WAVE1 and p22phox expression in PBMCs increased and was associated with the disease course in children with ALL.

The expression of CTGF was also detected with immunohistochemistry assay. The level of CTGF mRNA was detected with RT-PCR. Results 1 The CTGF protein levels of HLF-02 cells were significantly up-regulated after incubated with 1 ng/mL TGF-β31 for 15 min(P<0. 01 vs Control). The CTGF mRNA was also up-regulated. The levels of CTGF protein and CTGF mRNA expression was up-regulated by TGF-βi in a time-dependent manner. 2 The expression of NF-κB and AP-1 increased after HLF-02 cells were incubated with 1 ng/mL TGF-J31 for 30 min(P<0. 01 vs Control). The CTGF protein levels were inhibited obviously after HLF-02 cells were incubated with PDTC or curcumin. 2 The expression of CTGF. NF-κB and AP-1 decreased after pre-incubation with different doses of rosiglitazone(P<0. 01 vs TGF-βl group). The CTGF mRNA were also markedly inhibited(P<0. 01 vs TGF-β1 group). Conclusion It is supposed that rosiglitazone inhibits CTGF expression induced by TGF-β1 in HLF-02 cells by activating PPARγ through NF-κB and AP-1 signal transduction pathways.

68349114829	Relationship between p53 gene and chromosome 13q14 variations and prognosis in primary intestinal lymphoma	Objective: Some research has shown that primary intestinal lymphoma with the same immunophenotype has different prognosis. It suggests that the prognosis of this disease is not determined by a single factor but may be related to genetic or chromosomal variations. The p53 gene is an important tumor suppressor gene, and 13q14 deletion is a common chromosomal abnormality of lymphocyte proliferation diseases. This study aimed to explore the role of the p53 gene and chromosome 13q14 variations in the assessment of prognosis in primary intestinal lymphoma. Methods: p53 gene and chromosome 13q14 expression in paraffin sections of 30 cases of primary intestinal lymphoma and 10 cases of lymph node reactive hyperplasia were ascertained using an improved FISH technique. Results: p53 gene deletion was found in 22.7% of patients with primary intestinal lymphoma at stage I-II and in 75.0% of patients at stage III-IV (χ

77956828581	Recombinant adeno-associated virus vector-mediated delivery of antisense interleukin-5 gene attenuates airway remodeling in allergic rats	Background: Increasing evidence indicates that eosinophils contribute greatly to airway remodeling in asthma. Since interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays a critical role in the regulation of eosinophils in asthma, anti-IL-5 therapy may be a novel approach to inhibit airway remodeling in asthma. Objectives: In this study, we applied a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector-mediated antisense IL-5 gene delivery (rAAV-ASIL-5) system to investigate its effect on airway remodeling in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged rats. Methods: rAAV-ASIL-5 was used to infect OVA-sensitized and -challenged rats. IL-5 protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was detected by ELISA. The eosinophils in BALF were counted. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1- and TGF-β2-positive cells in the peribronchial space were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Lung tissue was collected for Sirius red staining and histological analysis. Results: rAAV-ASIL-5 significantly decreased the level of IL-5 protein, the number of eosinophils in BALF and the numbers of TGF-β1- and TGF-β2-positive cells in the peribronchial space. The area of Sirius red staining in airways was also decreased. Moreover, the rAAV-ASIL-5 treatment inhibited the increase in total bronchial wall area and airway smooth muscle area. Conclusion: These results suggest that rAAV-ASIL-5-based gene therapy could be used to inhibit airway remodeling in allergic rats. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG.

Objectives: Our previous study has demonstrated that a recombinant adeno-associated virus containing antisense against IL-4 gene (rAAV-asIL4) vector could significantly suppress the expression of IL-4 protein and airway inflammation in the rat models of allergic asthma. In this study, we applied the rAAV-asIL4 vector to allergic rats to investigate the effects of anti-IL4 therapy on airway remodeling in allergic asthma. Methods: rAAV-asIL4 was used to infect the ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and challenged rats by tail-vein injection. IL-4 protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The number of eosinophils in BALF was counted. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and TGF-beta2-positive cells in the peribronchial space were detected by immunohistochemical staining, and collagen deposition beneath the basement membrane was detected by Sirius red stain.

78651286142	HMGB1-induced autophagy promotes chemotherapy resistance in leukemia cells	Autophagy, a tightly regulated lysosome-dependent catabolic pathway, is important in the regulation of cancer development and progression and in determining the response of tumor cells to anticancer therapy. However, the role of autophagy in leukemia still remains largely unknown. Here we show that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), the best characterized damage-associated molecular pattern, was released from leukemia cell lines after chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity and activated autophagy to protect against injury. Treatment with HMGB1-neutralizing antibodies increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy; whereas, exogenous HMGB1 rendered these cells more resistant to drug-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, exogenous HMGB1 increased autophagy as evaluated by increased expression of the autophagic marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II, degradation of sequestosome 1 (p62) and autophagosome formation. Furthermore, knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of either phosphoinositide 3-kinase-III or extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase inhibited HMGB1-induced autophagy. Taken together, these results suggest that HMGB1 release after chemotherapy is a critical regulator of autophagy and a potential drug target for therapeutic interventions in leukemia. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

78650831662	DAMP-mediated autophagy contributes to drug resistance	Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) are cellularly derived molecules that can initiate and perpetuate immune responses following trauma, ischemia and other types of tissue damage in the absence of pathogenic infection. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a prototypical DAMP and is associated with the hallmarks of cancer. Recently we found that HMGB1 release after chemotherapy treatment is a critical regulator of autophagy and a potential drug target for therapeutic interventions in leukemia. Overexpression of HMGB1 by gene transfection rendered leukemia cells resistant to cell death; whereas depletion or inhibition of HMGB1 and autophagy by RNA interference or pharmacological inhibitors increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. HMGB1 release sustains autophagy as assessed by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, redistribution of LC3 into cytoplasmic puncta, degradation of p62 and accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Moreover, these data suggest a role for HMGB1 in the regulation of autophagy through the PI3KC3-MEK-ERK pathway, supporting the notion that HMGB1-induced autophagy promotes tumor resistance to chemotherapy. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

79953666792	Autophagy regulates myeloid cell differentiation by p62/SQSTM1-mediated degradation of PML-RARα oncoprotein	PML-RARα oncoprotein is a fusion protein of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and the retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα) and causes acute promyelocytic leukemias (APL). A hallmark of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) responses in APL is PML-RARα degradation, which promotes cell differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that autophagy is a crucial regulator of PML-RARα degradation. Inhibition of autophagy by short hairpin (sh) RNA that target essential autophagy genes such as ATG1, ATG5 and PI3KC3, and by autophagy inhibitors (e.g., 3-methyladenine), blocked PML-RARα degradation and subsequently granulocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemic cells. In contrast, rapamycin, the mTOR kinase inhibitor, enhanced autophagy and promoted ATRA-induced PML-RARα degradation and myeloid cell differentiation. Moreover, PML-RARα co-immunoprecipitated with the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1, which is degraded through autophagy. Furthermore, knockdown of p62/SQSTM1 inhibited ATRA-induced PML-RARα degradation and myeloid cell differentiation. The identification of PML-RARα as a target of autophagy provides new insight into the mechanism of action of ATRA and its specificity for APL. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

79960022338	UV irradiation resistance-associated gene suppresses apoptosis by interfering with BAX activation	Ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) is a well-known regulator of autophagy by promoting autophagosome formation and maturation. However, little is known about the non-autophagic functions of UVRAG. Here, we present evidence that UVRAG functions as an unusual BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) suppressor to regulate apoptosis. Chemotherapy and radiation induces UVRAG expression and subsequently upregulates autophagy and apoptosis in tumour cells. Depletion of UVRAG expression by RNA interference renders tumour cells more sensitive to chemotherapy- and radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, UVRAG interacts with Bax, which inhibits apoptotic stimuli-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and-3. Our findings show that UVRAG has an essential role in the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by regulating the localization of Bax. This pathway represents a target for clinical intervention against tumours. © 2011 European molecular biology organization.

80051672312	On model of angiogenesis and the mechanism in porous silk fibroin films	The purpose of this paper is to explore the mechanism of the angiogenesis modes in the biomaterials implanted in vivo. By means of experimental observation and analysis of the capillary growing state in the porous silk fibroin film implanted into rats, we intended to develop a modeling expression on the growth mode of the capillaries in the biomaterials. Additionally, we proposed the response model of endothelial cells (ECs) resulting from vascular endothelial growth factor's concentrations at different stages after the implantation. With the implantation experiment, it was identified that angiogenesis developed in the way of capillary sprouting at the early stage of implantation and of intussusception at the late stage. Based on the response model of ECs, experimental results are explained. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

80053392926	A critical role for UVRAG in apoptosis	Autophagy and apoptosis are tightly regulated biological processes that are crucial for cell growth, development and tissue homeostasis. UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene), a mammalian homolog of yeast Vps38, activates the Beclin 1/PtdIns3KC3 (class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) complex, which promotes autophagosome formation. Moreover, UVRAG promotes autophagosome maturation by recruiting class C Vps complexes (HOPS complexes) and Rab7 of the late endosome. We found that UVRAG has anti-apoptotic activity during tumor therapy through interactions with Bax. UVRAG inhibits Bax translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria during chemotherapy- or UV irradiation-induced apoptosis of human tumor cells. Moreover, deletion of the UVRAG C2 domain abolishes Bax binding and anti-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that, in addition to its previously recognized pro-autophagy activity in response to starvation, UVRAG has cytoprotective functions in the cytosol that control the localization of Bax in tumor cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

81455124796	Effects of egt gene transfer on the development of Bombyx mori	This study investigated the effects of gain of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (EGT) gene function mutation on the development of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. A novel piggyBac-derived plasmid containing the egt gene from B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) driven by a heat-shock protein (hsp) 23.7 promoter, with a neomycin-resistance gene (neo) controlled by the BmNPV ie-1 promoter and a green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) under the control of the B. mori actin 3 (A3) promoter was constructed. The vector was transferred into silkworm eggs by sperm-mediated gene transfer. Transgenic silkworms were produced after screening for neo and gfp genes and gene transfer was verified by polymerase chain reaction, dot-blot hybridization and western blotting. The hatching rate of G1 generation silkworm eggs was about 60% lower than that of normal silkworm eggs. The duration of the G1 generation larval period was extended, and the G2 generation pupal stage lasted four days longer than that in non-transgenic silkworms. The ecdysone blood level in G2 silkworms in the third instar molting stage was reduced by up to 90%. These results show that EGT suppressed transgenic silkworm molting, and that egt expression in egt-transgenic silkworms resulted in arrest of metamorphosis from pupae to moths. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

83655190818	HMGB1 regulates autophagy through increasing transcriptional activities of JNK and ERK in human myeloid leukemia cells	HMGB1 is associated with human cancers and is an activator of autophagy which mediates chemotherapy resistance. We here show that the mRNA levels of HMGB1 are high in leukemia cells and it is involved in the progression of childhood chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). HMGB1 decreases the sensitivity of human myeloid leukemia cells K562 to anti-cancer drug induced death through up-regulating the autophagy pathway, which is confirmed by the observation with an increase in fusion of autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes. When overexpressing HMGB1, both mRNA levels of Beclin-1, VSP34 and UVRAG which are key genes involved in mammalian autophagy and protein levels of p-Bcl-2 and LC3-II are increased. Luciferase assays document that over-expression of HMGB1 increases the transcriptional activity of JNK and ERK, which may be silenced by siRNA. The results suggest that HMGB1 regulates JNK and ERK required for autophagy, which provides a potential drug target for therapeutic interventions in childhood CML.

84855180031	S100A8-targeting siRNA enhances arsenic trioxide-induced myeloid leukemia cell death by down-regulating autophagy	Chemoresistance has become a major obstacle to the successful treatment of leukemia. Autophagy, a regulated process of degradation and recycling of cellular constituents, has recently caught increasing attention for its roles in conferring resistance to various commonly used anticancer therapies. Here we showed that the member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family, S100A8, is a critical regulator of chemoresistance in the autophagy process. It positively correlated with the clinical status in childhood acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and it was released from leukemia cells after chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Knockdown of S100A8 expression increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy and apoptosis. Moreover, suppressing S100A8 expression decreased autophagy as evaluated by the increased expression of the autophagic marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II, degradation of SQSTM1/Sequestosome 1 (p62) and formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, stimuli that enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted cytosolic translocation of S100A8 and thereby enhanced autophagy. S100A8 directly interacted with the autophagy protein Beclin1 displacing Bcl-2. These results suggest that S100A8 is a critical pro-autophagic protein that enhances cell survival and regulates chemoresistance in leukemia cells likely through disassociating the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex.

84855406005	HMGB1 promotes drug resistance in osteosarcoma	Osteosarcoma is the most commonly occurring bone cancer in children and adolescents. Unfortunately, treatment failures are common due to the development of chemoresistance, for which the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we implicate the DNA-binding protein HMGB1, which also exerts immunoregulatory effects in its secreted form, in the development of drug resistance in osteosarcoma. Anticancer agents including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate each induced HMGB1 upregulation in human osteosarcoma cells, and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of HMGB1 restored the chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic investigation revealed that HMGB1 increased drug resistance by inducing autophagy, an intracellular self-defense mechanism known to confer drug resistance. We found that HMGB1 bound to the autophagy regulator Beclin1 and regulated the formation of the Beclin1-PI3KC3 [PI3KC3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class 3] complex that facilitates autophagic progression. In addition, we found that interaction between HMGB1 and Beclin1 relied upon the autophagic complex ULK1-mAtg13-FIP200. Therefore, through its role as a regulator of autophagy, HMGB1 is a critical factor in the development of chemoresistance, and it offers a novel target for improving osteosarcoma therapy. ©2011 AACR.

84862908645	Up-regulated autophagy by endogenous high mobility group box-1 promotes chemoresistance in leukemia cells	Autophagy has recently attracted increasing attention for its role in conferring resistance to various commonly used anticancer therapies. Whereas its activities are known primarily to be under regulation of the high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) gene, the expression of HMGB1 and its function in leukemia cells still remain unclear. In this study, we found that HMGB1 was expressed abundantly in various kinds of both leukemia and non-blood cancer cell-lines, and its expression was positively correlated with clinical status in childhood leukemia. In leukemia cells, when endogenous HMGB1 increased starvation-induced autophagy, this reaction was inhibited by the suppression of HMGB1. While the use of autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), blocked the autophagic reaction and increased leukemia cell sensitivity to chemotherapy, enhancing HMGB1 expression decreased this sensitivity. Notably, suppressing HMGB1 expression also increased leukemia cell chemosensitivity. Furthermore, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway was found to be functionally connected with HMGB1. HMGB1 gene transfection increased the LC3-II level and inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K levels. Knockdown of HMGB1 expression blocked the association between mTOR and raptor in the setting of enhanced autophagy. When class I PI3K was inhibited by PI3K-I shRNA, it decreased the PI3K-I expression level. Knockdown of HMGB1 expression had no further effects on LC3-II. These results suggest that endogenous HMGB1 is an intrinsic regulator of autophagy in leukemia cells and it enhances leukemia cell chemoresistance likely through the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

84863141780	Targeting HMGB1-mediated autophagy as a novel therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma	Autophagy is a catabolic process critical to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cytotoxic insult. Autophagy is recognized as "programmed cell survival" in contrast to apoptosis or programmed cell death. Upregulation of autophagy has been observed in many types of cancers and has been demonstrated to both promote and inhibit antitumor drug resistance depending to a large extent on the nature and duration of the treatment-induced metabolic stress as well as the tumor type. Cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate are commonly used anticancer drugs in osteosarcoma, the most common form of childhood and adolescent cancer. Our recent study demonstrated that high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1)-mediated autophagy is a significant contributor to drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells. Inhibition of both HMGB1 and autophagy increase the drug sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the ULK1-FIP200 complex is required for the interaction between HMGB1 and BECN1, which then promotes BECN1-PtdIns3KC3 complex formation during autophagy. Thus, these findings provide a novel mechanism of osteosarcoma resistance to therapy facilitated by HMGB1-mediated autophagy and provide a new target for the control of drug-resistant osteosarcoma patients. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84863423871	Comparison of leukotriene receptor antagonists in addition to inhaled corticosteroid and inhaled corticosteroid alone in the treatment of adolescents and adults with bronchial asthma: A meta-analysis	Background: Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) have been recommended as treatment for persistent asthma. It is not clear whether oral LTRA in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) confers any additional benefit over ICS alone. Objective: This meta-analysis was conducted to review the evidence for the benefits and risks of ICS-LTRA in comparison to ICS alone in bronchial asthma. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies published through Aug 20, 2011. Studies comparing ICS-LTRA and ICS and those comparing ICS-LTRA and high-dose ICS were examined separately. Studies were pooled to yield odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Eight trials in which ICS-LTRA was compared with the same dose of ICS and five in which ICS-LTRA was compared with high-dose ICS were identified. In adults with mild to moderate asthma, the combination of ICS-LTRA improves the control of asthma when compared with same dose of ICS as monotherapy. The effects of ICS-LTRA therapy are similar to those of high-dose ICS in asthma control, but high-dose ICS is superior to ICS-LTRA with regard to improvement in some pulmonary function indices. Conclusions: In adults with mild to moderate asthma, though the effects were minimal, the combination of ICS-LTRA is recommended, when comparing its effects with the same dose ICS as monotherapy. The relative merits of ICS-LTRA and high-dose ICS therapy are uncertain and more research is needed.

84865187115	Increased expression of interleukin-18 and its receptor in peripheral blood of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex systemic disorder characterized by both local pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Many studies suggested that activation of circulating inflammatory cells and increased circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines occur in COPD. Interleukin (IL)-18 is a unique proinflammatory cytokine that mediates its effects by binding to the IL-18 receptor (IL-18R). In the present study, the expression of IL-18 in serum and IL-18R on peripheral blood T lymphocytes was analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the serum levels of IL-18 and interferon (IFN)-gamma;, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured by chemiluminiscent immunoassay. Expression of IL-18R was examined using a three-color flow cytometry method. In total, 120 subjects were recruited including 32 nonsmokers, 30 current smokers and 58 stable COPD patients. Serum levels of IL-18 and hsCRP were significantly higher in stable COPD patients than those in nonsmokers and current smokers. A significant negative correlation existed between pulmonary function and serum level of IL-18 rather than hsCRP in stable COPD patients. The proportions of IL-18Rα-expressing T lymphocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly higher in stable COPD patients than in nonsmokers and current smokers. The current study extended prior analyses by examining IL-18R expression in peripheral blood. The results suggested that IL-18/IL-18R system was active in peripheral blood of COPD patients. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Methods: Human bronchial smooth muscle cells (HBSMCs) were taken from normal pulmonary tissue in surgery and cultured in vitro treated with normal human serum or asthmatic serum. Epidermal growth factor, PD98059 and ERK1/2 antisense oligonucleotide were used to explore the role of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The expression of Phospho-ERK1/2 in HBSMCs was analyzed by Western blot. Secretion of HBSMCs was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Results: The level of Phospho-ERK1/2 increased in HBSMCs passive sensitized with asthmatic serum compared with normal serum. HBSMCs of asthmatic serum group secreted much more growth factors (TGF-β1, VEGF and CTGF), cytokines (RANTES and EOTAXIN) and extracellular matrix (Fibronectin and CollangenI) than that of normal controls. Epidermal growth factor stimulated the secretions of both two groups, but the response of chronic asthmatic group was more intense. Both PD98059 and antisense oligonucleotide were able to suppress the secretions of passive sensitized HBSMCs, but antisense oligonucleotide reduced the level of RANTES nearly to that of normal controls, while PD98059 couldn't. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ERK1/2 signalling pathway may play an important role in the increased secretion of passive sensitized HBSMCs, and ERK1/2 antisense oligonucleotide is capable to slow down the process.

Eighteen BALB/c mice were divided into asthma group, control group and dexamethasone group. In dexamethasone group, dexamethasone was intraperitoneally administered. Expression of AGR2 protein and Muc5ac protein in the murine lung tissues was immunohistochemically detected. IL-13 level was determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by ELISA. The results exhibited that the expression of AGR2 protein in asthma group (0.522±0.041) was significantly higher than that in normal controls (0.361±0.047) (P<0.01) and bore a positive linear relationship to the expression of Muc5ac protein (r=0.873, P<0.05) and IL-13 level (r=0.828, P<0.05). Expression of AGR2 protein in the dexamethasone group (0.456±0.049) was significantly lower than that in the asthma group. It was concluded that: (1) the expression of AGR2 protein was significantly higher in asthmatic mice as compared with their normal counterparts; (2) the expression was obviously related to the expression of Muc5ac protein and IL-13; (3) dexamethasone could down-regulate the expression of AGR2 protein. Our findings suggested that AGR2 might be involved in the over-secretion of mucus in the airway in asthma. © 2013 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84884540574	Chloroquine inhibits HMGB1 inflammatory signaling and protects mice from lethal sepsis	Sepsis is caused by an overwhelming immune response to bacterial infection. The discovery of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a late mediator of lethal sepsis has prompted investigation into the development of new therapeutics which specifically target this protein. Here, we show that chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, prevents lethality in mice with established endotoxemia or sepsis. This effect is still observed even if administration of chloroquine is delayed. The protective effects of chloroquine were mediated through inhibition of HMGB1 release in macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells, thereby preventing its cytokine-like activities. As an inhibitor of autophagy, chloroquine specifically inhibited HMGB1-induced Ik-B degradation and NF-kB activation. These findings define a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine and also suggest a new potential clinical use for this drug in the setting of sepsis.

84896927598	MIR34A regulates autophagy and apoptosis by targeting HMGB1 in the retinoblastoma cell	MIR34A (microRNA 34a) is a tumor suppressor gene, but how it regulates chemotherapy response and resistance is not completely understood. Here, we show that the microRNA MIR34A-dependent high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) downregulation inhibits autophagy and enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the retinoblastoma cell. HMGB1 is a multifaceted protein with a key role in autophagy, a self-degradative, homeostatic process with a context-specific role in cancer. MIR34A inhibits HMGB1 expression through a direct MIR34A-binding site within the HMGB1 3′ untranslated region. MIR34A inhibition of HMGB1 leads to a decrease in autophagy under starvation conditions or chemotherapy treatment. Inhibition of autophagy promotes oxidative injury and DNA damage and increases subsequent CASP3 activity, CASP3 cleavage, and PARP1 [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1] cleavage, which are important to the apoptotic process. Finally, upregulation of MIR34A, knockdown of HMGB1, or inhibition of autophagy (e.g., knockdown of ATG5 and BECN1) restores chemosensitivity and enhances tumor cell death in the retinoblastoma cell. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms governing the regulation of HMGB1 expression by microRNA and their possible contribution to autophagy and drug resistance. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

84902482355	Mannose-binding lectin two gene polymorphisms and tuberculosis	Numerous studies have been done to explore the association between mannose-binding lectin two (MBL2) gene polymorphisms and the risk of tuberculosis (TB). However, the results are inconsistent. We performed a meta-Analysis to investigate whether polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene were associated with TB risk. Databases including PubMed, Medline, Chinese Biomedicine Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, and Weipu Database were searched to find relevant articles published up to 2 October, 2012. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the strength of association. All statistical tests were performed by using Revman 5.1 software and STATA 11.0 software. Six case-control studies including 1106 cases and 1190 controls were accepted in the meta-Analysis. The results indicated that individuals carrying the MBL2 codon 54 B allele may have an increased risk of TB as compared with AA homozygotes (BB+AB vs. AA: OR=1.52, 95% CI: 1.22-1.88), whereas MBL2 +4 P/Q was possibly not associated with TB susceptibility in Chinese population. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

84904489275	PKM2 regulates the Warburg effect and promotes HMGB1 release in sepsis	Increasing evidence suggests the important role of metabolic reprogramming in the regulation of the innate inflammatory response, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide evidence to support a novel role for the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)-mediated Warburg effect, namely aerobic glycolysis, in the regulation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release. PKM2 interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and activates the HIF-1α -dependent transcription of enzymes necessary for aerobic glycolysis in macrophages. Knockdown of PKM2, HIF1α and glycolysis-related genes uniformly decreases lactate production and HMGB1 release. Similarly, a potential PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin, reduces serum lactate and HMGB1 levels, and protects mice from lethal endotoxemia and sepsis. Collectively, these findings shed light on a novel mechanism for metabolic control of inflammation by regulating HMGB1 release and highlight the importance of targeting aerobic glycolysis in the treatment of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84907322144	HGK/MAP4K4 deficiency induces TRAF2 stabilization and Th17 differentiation leading to insulin resistance	Proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in insulin resistance. Here we report that mice with a T-cell-specific conditional knockout of HGK (T-HGK cKO) develop systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This condition is ameliorated by either IL-6 or IL-17 neutralization. HGK directly phosphorylates TRAF2, leading to its lysosomal degradation and subsequent inhibition of IL-6 production. IL-6-overproducing HGK-deficient T cells accumulate in adipose tissue and further differentiate into IL-6/IL-17 double-positive cells. Moreover, CCL20 neutralization or CCR6 deficiency reduces the Th17 population or insulin resistance in T-HGK cKO mice. In addition, leptin receptor deficiency in T cells inhibits Th17 differentiation and improves the insulin sensitivity in T-HGK cKO mice, which suggests that leptin cooperates with IL-6 to promote Th17 differentiation. Thus, HGK deficiency induces TRAF2/IL-6 upregulation, leading to IL-6/leptin-induced Th17 differentiation in adipose tissue and subsequent insulin resistance. These findings provide insight into the reciprocal regulation between the immune system and the metabolism. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

84907463121	KLF5 promotes hypoxia-induced survival and inhibits apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer cells via HIF-1α	Transcription factor Krüppel-like factors 5 (KLF5) is overexpressed in a wide range of tumor tissues and acts as a prognostic factor in cancer. However, the role of KLF5 in non-small cell lung cancer is not clear. Hypoxia plays a vital part in the development of cancer via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Our study showed that hypoxia (1% O<inf>2</inf>) increased cell viability, clonality and proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in A549 cells. The expression of HIF-1α and KLF5 was increased time-dependently in hypoxia. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting KLF5 or HIF-1α, we demonstrated that KLF5 or HIF-1α knockdown inhibited hypoxia-induced cell survival and promoted cell apoptosis by actively downregulating cyclin B1, survivin and upregulating caspase-3. Given the similar effect of KLF5 and HIF-1α on cell survival, an attempt was made to investigate the putative interaction of them in hypoxia. KLF5 was revealed to co-immunoprecipitate with HIF-1α and hypoxia increased the amount of KLF5 and HIF-1α complex. Moreover, silencing of KLF5 decreased HIF-1α expression while KLF5 was not affected by HIF-1α inhibition in hypoxia, confirming the effect of KLF5 on upregulation of HIF-1α. In conclusion, this study identified hypoxia as a tumor promoter by triggering KLF5 → HIF-1α → cyclin B1/survivin/caspase-3 in lung cancer cells.
