84938740435	Development and validation of a prediction score for complications after hepatectomy in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients	Objective and Background: The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a prediction score for postoperative complications by severity and guide perioperative management and patient selection in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing liver resection. Methods: A total of 1543 consecutive liver resections cases were included in the study. Randomly selected sample set of 70% of the study cohort was used to develop a score to predict complications III-V and the remaining 30% was used to validate the score. Based on the preoperative and predictable intraoperative parameters, logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors and create an integer score for the predicting of complication. Results: American Society of Anesthesiologists category, portal hypertension, major liver resection (more than 3 segments) and extrahepatic procedures were identified as independent predictors for complications III-V by logistic regression analysis. A score system integrating these 4 factors was stratified into three groups and significantly predicted the risk of complications III-V, with a rate of 1.6%, 11.9% and 65.6% for low, moderate and high risk, respectively. Using the score, the complications risk could be predicted accurately in the validation set, without significant differences between predicted (10.4%) and observed (8.4%) risks for complications III-V (P = 0.466). Conclusions: Based on four preoperative risk factors, we have developed and validated an integer-based risk score to predict postoperative severe complications after liver resection for hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients in high-volume surgical center. This score may contribute to preoperative risk stratification and clinical decision-making. © 2014 Wang et al.

1542374664	Augmented regeneration of partial liver allograft induced by nuclear factor-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides-modified dendritic cells	Aim: To investigate the effect of NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynuleotides (ODNs) - modified dendritic cells (DCs) on regeneration of partial liver allograft. Methods: Bone marrow (BM)- derived DCs from SD rats were propagated in the presence of GM-CSF or GM-CSF+IL-4 to obtain immature DCs or mature DCs, respectively. GM-CSF-propagated DCs were treated with double-strand NF-κb decoy ODNs containing two NF-κB binding sites or scrambled ODNs. Allogeneic (SD rat to LEW rat) 50% partial liver transplantation was performed. Normal saline (group A), GM-CSF -propagated DCs (group B), GM-CSF+IL-4 - propagated DCs (group C), and GM-CSF+NF-κB decoy ODNs (group D) or scrambled ODNs -propagated DCs (group E) were injected intravenously into recipient LEW rats 7 days prior to liver transplantation and immediately after transplantation. DNA synthesis (BrdU labeling) and apoptosis of hepatocytes were detected with immunostaining and TUNEL staining postoperative 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 84 h, respectively. Liver graft-resident NK cell activity, hepatic IFN-γ mRNA expression and recipient serum IFN-γ level at the time of the maximal liver allograft regeneration were measured with

1942503366	Understanding SARS with Wolfram approach	Stepping acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as another type of disease has been threatening mankind since late last year. Many scientists worldwide are making great efforts to study the etiology of this disease with different approaches. 13 species of SARS virus have been sequenced. However, most people still largely rely on the traditional methods with some disadvantages. In this work, we used Wolfram approach to study the relationship among SARS viruses and between SARS viruses and other types of viruses, the effect of variations on the whole genome and the advantages in the analysis of SARS based on this novel approach. As a result, the similarities between SARS viruses and other coronaviruses are not really higher than those between SARS viruses and non-coronaviruses.

18844374161	Predicting protein subcellular location using digital signal processing	The biological functions of a protein are closely related to its attributes in a cell. With the rapid accumulation of newly found protein sequence data in databanks, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method for predicting the subcellular location of proteins. The establishment of such a predictor will expedite the functional determination of newly found proteins and the process of prioritizing genes and proteins identified by genomic efforts as potential molecular targets for drug design. The traditional algorithms for predicting these attributes were based solely on amino acid composition in which no sequence order effect was taken into account. To improve the prediction quality, it is necessary to incorporate such an effect. However, the number of possible patterns in protein sequences is extremely large, posing a formidable difficulty for realizing this goal. To deal with such difficulty, a well-developed tool in digital signal processing named digital Fourier transform (DFT) [1] was introduced. After being translated to a digital signal according to the hydrophobicity of each amino acid, a protein was analyzed by DFT within the frequency domain. A set of frequency spectrum parameters, thus obtained, were regarded as the factors to represent the sequence order effect. A significant improvement in prediction quality was observed by incorporating the frequency spectrum parameters with the conventional amino acid composition. One of the crucial merits of this approach is that many existing tools in mathematics and engineering can be easily applied in the predicting process. It is anticipated that digital signal processing may serve as a useful vehicle for many other protein science areas. ©Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

23044493965	Rates of adult schizophrenia following prenatal exposure to the Chinese famine of 1959-1961	Context: Schizophrenia is a common major mental disorder. Intrauterine nutritional deficiency may increase the risk of schizophrenia. The main evidence comes from studies of the 1944-1945 Dutch Hunger Winter when a sharp and time-limited decline in food intake occurred. The most exposed cohort conceived during the famine showed a 2-fold increased risk of schizophrenia. Objective: To determine whether those who endured a massive 1959-1961 famine in China experienced similar results. Design, Setting, and Participants: The risk of schizophrenia was examined in the Wuhu region of Anhui, one of the most affected provinces. Rates were compared among those born before, during, and after the famine years. Wuhu and its surrounding 6 counties are served by a single psychiatric hospital. All psychiatric case records for the years 1971 through 2001 were examined, and clinical and sociodemographic information on patients with schizophrenia was extracted by researchers who were blinded to the nature of exposure. Data on number of births and deaths in the famine years were available, and cumulative mortality was estimated from later demographic surveys. Main Outcome Measures: Evidence of famine was verified, and unadjusted and mortality-adjusted relative risks of schizophrenia were calculated. Results: The birth rates (per 1000) in Anhui decreased approximately 80% during the famine years from 28.28 in 1958 and 20.97 in 1959 to 8.61 in 1960 and 11.06 in 1961. Among births that occurred during the famine years, the adjusted risk of developing schizophrenia in later life increased significantly, from 0.84% in 1959 to 2.15% in 1960 and 1.81% in 1961. The mortality-adjusted relative risk was 2.30 (95% confidence interval, 1.99-2.65) for those born in 1960 and 1.93 (95% confidence interval, 1.68-2.23) for those born in 1961. Conclusion: Our findings replicate the Dutch data for a separate racial group and show that prenatal exposure to famine increases risk of schizophrenia in later life. ©2005 American Medical Association.

31144462896	Nuclear factor-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides attenuates ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat liver graft	Aim: To evaluate the protective effect of NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rat liver graft. Methods: Orthotopic syngeneic rat liver transplantation was performed with 3 h of cold preservation of liver graft in University of Wisconsin solution containing phosphorothioated double-stranded NF-κB decoy ODNs or scrambled ODNs. NF-κB decoy ODNs or scrambled ODNs were injected intravenously into donor and recipient rats 6 and 1 h before operation, respectively. Recipients were killed 0 to 16 h after liver graft reperfusion. NF-κB activity in the liver graft was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Hepatic mRNA expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were determined by semiquantitative RT PCR. Serum levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Serum level of alanine transaminase (ALT) was measured using a diagnostic kit. Liver graft myeloperoxidase (MPO) content was assessed. Results: NF-κB activation in liver graft was induced in a time-dependent manner, and NF-κB remained activated for 16 h after graft reperfusion. NF-κB activation in liver graft was significant at 2 to 8 h and slightly decreased at 16 h after graft reperfusion. Administration of NF-κB decoy ODNs significantly suppressed NF-κB activation as well as mRNA expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ and ICAM-1 in the liver graft. The hepatic NF-κB DNA binding activity [presented as integral optical density (IOD) value] in the NF-κB decoy ODNs treatment group rat was significantly lower than that of the I/R group rat (2.16±0.78 vs 36.78 ±6.35 and 3.06±0.84 vs 47.62± 8.71 for IOD value after 4 and 8 h of reperfusion, respectively, P<0.001). The hepatic mRNA expression level of TNF-α, IFN-γ and ICAM-1 [presented as percent of β-actin mRNA (%)] in the NF-κB decoy ODNs treatment group rat was significantly lower than that of the I/R group rat (8.31 ±3.48 vs 46.37±10.65 and 7.46± 3.72 vs 74.82±12.25 for hepatic TNF-α mRNA, 5.58±2.16 vs 50.46±9.35 and 6.47±2.53 vs 69.72±13.41 for hepatic IFN-γ mRNA, 6.79 ±2.83 vs 46.23±8.74 and 5.28±2.46 vs 67.44±10.12 for hepatic ICAM-1 mRNA expression after 4 and 8 h of reperfusion, respectively, P<0.001). Administration of NF-κB decoy ODNs almost completely abolished the increase of serum level of TNF-α and IFN-γ induced by hepatic ischemia/reperfusion, the serum level (pg/mL) of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the NF-κB decoy ODNs treatment group rat was significantly lower than that of the I/R group rat (42.7±13.6 vs 176.7±15.8 and 48.4±15.1 vs 216.8±17.6 for TNF-α level, 31.5±12.1 vs 102.1±14.5 and 40.2±13.5 vs 118.6±16.7 for IFN-γ level after 4 and 8 h of reperfusion, respectively, P<0.001). Liver graft neutrophil recruitment indicated by MPO content and hepatocellular injury indicated by serum ALT level were significantly reduced by NF-κB decoy ODNs, the hepatic MPO content (A655) and serum ALT level (IU/L) in the NF-κB decoy ODNs treatment group rat was significantly lower than that of the I/R group rat (0.17±0.07 vs 1.12 ±0.25 and 0.46±0.17 vs 1.46±0.32 for hepatic MPO content, 71.7±33.2 vs 286.1±49.6 and 84.3±39.7 vs 467.8±62.3 for ALT level after 4 and 8 h of reperfusion, respectively, P<0.001). Conclusion: The data suggest that NF-κB decoy ODNs protects against I/R injury in liver graft by suppressing NF-κB activation and subsequent expression of proinflammatory mediators. ©2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

31544450753	Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation	Objective: To investigate the approach which could improve the survival rate of adult-to adult living donor liver transplantations, that right lobe liver grafts were performed by a modified technique. Methods: During from March to June 2005, 13 patients underwent the living donor liver transplantation with right lobe grafts via the improved surgical techniques including the reconstruction of right hepatic vein; the tributaries of the middle hepatic vein were reconstructed by interpositioning a vein grafts; the anastomosis of the hepatic arteries and bile ducts. All cases underwent the direct anastomosis of right hepatic vein and IVC, of whom 5 cases were added with the reconstructions of right inferior hepatic vein, and other 5 cases added with reconstructing the tributaries of the middle hepatic vein by interpositing a vein graft to provide sufficient venous outflow. Results: No donor suffered from severe complication or death. Four complications occurred in recipients who got the hepatic artery thrombosis (1 case), bile leakage (1 case), right subphrenic abscess (1 case) or pulmonary infection (1 case) respectively. The recipient with pulmonary infection died of MOF. The graft organ and recipient weight ratio (GRWR) were between 0.72% and 1.24%, that the ratios of 9 cases was <1.0% and 2 cases <0.8%, with no "small-for-size syndrome" occurred. Conclusions: The improved surgical techniques, especially the reconstruction of hepatic vein to provide sufficient venous outflow, can make the adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation with right lobe liver grafts become a relatively safe operation and prevent the "small-for-size syndrome".

33646534632	Meta-analysis of association between ApoE ε4 allele and schizophrenia	Several case-control studies have reported an association between schizophrenia and the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E gene. The results have been equivocal. This meta-analysis has evaluated the collective evidence for an association between the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E gene and schizophrenia. We analyzed published data sequentially first considering ε4 allele itself, and then ε4 carrier status as risk factors for schizophrenia using a sample of 17 population-based case-control studies, of which 6 were from Asian and 11 from Caucasian populations. The pooled odds ratios from the Caucasian populations showed a modest association with risk of schizophrenia for ε4 allele and ε4 carrier genotype. No other alleles or genotypes were significant in either Asian or Caucasian populations when analysed separately or combined, although the sample size had over 80% power to detect a significant odds ratio of 1.9 in Asian-population studies and 1.6 in Caucasian-population studies. After allowing for sensitivity analysis of the studies and assessment of publication bias, we conclude that the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E does not play a major role in risk of schizophrenia in Caucasian populations. Since significant heterogeneity was present among the 6 Asian populations reported to date, further studies using larger sample sizes are required. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33744799409	Modified techniques for adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation	Background: Because of critical organ shortage, transplant professionals have utilized living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in recent years. We summarized our experience in adult-to-adult LDLT with grafts of right liver lobe by a modified technique. Methods: From January 2002 to August 2005, 24 adult patients underwent living donor liver transplantation with grafts of the right liver lobe at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. Twenty-two patients underwent modified procedures designed to improve the reconstruction of the right hepatic vein and the tributaries of the middle hepatic vein by interposing a great saphenous vein (GSV) graft and the anastomosis of the hepatic arteries and bile ducts. Results: No severe complications and death occurred in all donors. In the first 2 patients, (patients 1 and 2), operative procedure was not modified. One patient suffered from "small-for-size syndrome" and the other died of sepsis with progressive deterioration of graft function. In the rest 22 patients (patients 3 to 24), however, the procedure of venous reconstruction was modified, and better results were obtained. Complications occurred in 7 recipients including acute rejection (2 patients), hepatic artery thrombosis (1), bile leakage (1), intestinal bleeding (1), left subphrenic abscess (1), and pulmonary infection (1). One patient with pulmonary infection died of multiple organ failure (MOF). The 22 patients underwent direct anastomosis of the right hepatic vein to the inferior vena cava (IVC), 9 direct anastomosis plus the reconstruction of the right inferior hepatic vein, and 10 direct anastomosis plus the reconstruction of the tributaries of the middle hepatic vein by interpos-ing a GSV graft to provide sufficient venous outflow. Trifurcation of the portal vein was met in 3 patients. Venoplasty or separate anastomosis was performed. The ratio of graft to recipient body weight ranged from 0.72% to 1.17%. Among these patients, 19 had the ratio <1.0% and 4 <0.8%, and the ratio of graft weight to recipient standard liver volume was between 31.86% and 62.48%. Among these patients, 10 had the ratio <50% and 2 <40%. No "small-for-size syndrome" occurred in the 22 recipients who were subjected to modified procedures. Conclusions: With the modified surgical techniques for the reconstruction of the hepatic vein to obtain an adequate outflow and provide a sufficient functioning liver mass, living donor liver graft in adults using the right lobe can be safe to prevent the "small-for-size syndrome". © 2006, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

33748060508	Intramuscular hepatitis B immune globulin combined with lamivudine in prevention of hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation	Background: Combined hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and lamivudine in prophylaxis of the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Methods: A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients (43 men and 8 women) transplanted for benign HBV-related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months. HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter. Results: At a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3.9% (2/51). The overall patient survival was 88.3%, and 82.4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively. A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57.1% (4/7) and 62.5% (5/8) of HBV-DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative. Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients. Conclusion: Lamivudine combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation. © 2006, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

33748329428	Introduction of microvascular surgery to biliary reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation	Objective: To explore the feasibility of introduction of microvascular surgery into biliary reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) so as to reduce the incidence of postoperative biliary complications. Methods: The experience in the microvascular surgery performed on 32 patients undergoing LDLT, 8 children and 24 adults, including duct-to-duct anstomosis in 21 case, hepato-jejunostomy under surgical loupe in 13 cases, and hepato-jejunostomy under operative microscopy in 9 cases, totally 43 cases of biliary reconstruction manipulations. Results: Post-operative biliary complications occurred in 2 patients. One male patient who underwent hepato-jejunostomy under surgical loupe suffered from leakage from a bilioenteric anastomotic stoma 3 days after operation and laparotomy was performed to repair the leakage and carry out drainage. Mild stricture of the anstomotic stoma occurred in the other patient 3 months after operation and conservative treatment was given. Both patients recovered. Conclusion: Introduction of microvascular surgery to biliary reconstruction in LDLT, especially the use of operative microscopy for hepato-jejunostomy on very small hepatic ducts, ≤2 mm in diameter, achieves good results, with significant reduction of post-operative complications.

33750454081	Polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene are associated with the therapeutic response to risperidone in Chinese schizophrenia patients	P-glycoprotein, a product of the ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) gene, plays an important role in absorption and distribution of drugs. The brain entry of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone is greatly limited by P-glycoprotein, which implies that the functional polymorphisms of ABCB1 in humans may be a factor contributing to the variability in response to risperidone. The present study was therefore designed to examine whether polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene are related to therapeutic response. For this purpose, 130 Chinese schizophrenia patients undergoing risperidone treatment were recruited. Plasma drug concentrations were monitored and clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) before and 8 weeks after the treatment. Association tests between genotypes and percentage improvement in total BPRS scores were performed using analyses of variance. Our results show that genotyping C1236T may help to predict the efficacy of risperidone treatment on the basis that patients with the TT genotype showed greater improvement than those with other genotypes on the overall BPRS (F = 3.967, p = 0.021), while other polymorphisms, including rs13233308, G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphism, did not show any association with the response to risperidone. These results showed suggestive evidence that genetic variation in the ABCB1 gene may influence the individual response to risperidone. © 2006 Future Medicine Ltd.

33751114966	Postoperative Severe Pneumonia in Adult Liver Transplant Recipients	Severe pneumonia in adult liver transplantation (OLT) recipients is a dangerous condition with significant morbidity and mortality. To analyze the risk factors for postoperative severe pneumonia in OLT patients, we collected data from 132 consecutive adult patients who underwent OLT between February 1999 and April 2004. According to the American Thoracic Society consensus statement, episodes of severe pneumonia were observed in 24 patients (18.2%). We retrospectively reviewed the etiology diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the 24 recipients. Bacteria were responsible for 95.8% of these episodes (23 of 24), fungi for 16.7% (4 of 24) and viruses for 4.4% (1 of 24). Twenty-six percent of the bacterial pneumonias were due to Streptococcus alpha hemolyticus. The mortality rate was 37.5% (9 of 24) for patients with severe pneumonia versus 7.4% (8 of 108, P = .004) for patients without pneumonia. Two cases with hepatorenal syndrome died, and three patients with coinfection by bacteria and fungi died. Acute rejection episodes occurred in 15 patients, four of whom died. Mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy were required in 13 cases (54%). Six who experienced prolonged intubation died. Sputum and pleural fluid cultures helped to establish a diagnosis in 91.7% (22 of 24) of cases. Twenty cases (83%) underwent reduction in the immunosuppressive regimen. Patient age, intraoperative transfusion requirements, extubation time, and hospital stay were fatal predictors of prognoses. We concluded that early detection of the responsible pathogen; timely and specific diagnosis; reduction in the immunosuppressive regimen; appropriate treatment with reliable, effective techniques; and implementation of sensitive culture-based antibiotics was an effective strategy to treat severe adult pneumonia in liver transplantation recipients. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33846642582	Safety of Donor in Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Using Right Lobe Graft	Background: The growing gap between the number of patients awaiting liver transplantation and available organs has continued to be the primary issue facing the transplant community. To overcome the waiting list mortality, living donor liver transplantation has become an option, in which the greatest concern is the safety of the donor, especially in adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (A-A LDLT) using a right lobe liver graft. Objective: We evaluated the safety of donors after right lobe liver donation for A-A LDLT performed in our center. Methods: From January 2002 to March 2006, 26 patients underwent A-A LDLT using right lobe liver grafts in our center. Seven donors were men and 19 were women (range, 19-65 years; median age, 38 years). The right lobe liver grafts were obtained by transecting the liver on the right side of the middle hepatic vein without interrupting the vascular blood flow. The mean follow-up time for these donors was 9 months. Results: These donor residual liver volumes ranged from 30.5% to 60.3%. We did not experience any donor mortality. Two cases (7.69%) experienced major complications: intra-abdominal bleeding and portal vein thrombosis in one each and three (11.54%), minor ones: wound steatosis in two, and transient chyle leak in one. All donors were fully recovered and returned to their previous occupations. Conclusions: A-A LDLT using a right lobe liver graft has become a standard option. The donation of right lobe liver for A-A LDLT was a relatively safe procedure in our center. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Two common functional polymorphisms C-270T and Val66Met within the BDNF gene were first reported by Kunugi et al. [Kunugi, H., Nanko, S., Hirasawa, H., Kato, N., Nabika, T., Kobayashi, S., 2003. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene and schizophrenia: polymorphism screening and association analysis. Schizophr. Res. 62, 281-283.] and pls expand this too: Hong et al. (2003) to be significantly associated with schizophrenia. However, subsequently several studies obtained conflicting results. Methods: We compared the allele/genotype frequencies of the C-270T and Val66Met polymorphisms and the haplotype frequencies at the two polymorphisms in a moderate independent patient-control sample from the Han Chinese population. Two systematic meta-analyses were performed to assess the collective evidence for association across studies for each of the two polymorphisms. Results: No statistically significant differences were found in allele or genotype or haplotype frequencies between patient and normal control subjects for either of the two polymorphisms. On the other hand, the meta-analysis of all published population-based association studies showed statistically significant evidence for heterogeneity among each of the two polymorphisms. Stratification of the studies by ethnicity of the samples yielded no significant evidence for an association with the polymorphisms in the Caucasian population (for C-270T polymorphism: pooled OR

33846923067	Response of risperidone treatment may be associated with polymorphisms of HTT gene in Chinese schizophrenia patients	Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a key component of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system. Few studies have focused on polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter and antipsychotic response and, in particular, there have so far been no published studies on the association between the serotonin transporter and response to risperidone. This study examined the relationship between two polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter and the efficacy of risperidone treatment in 129 patients with schizophrenia. Our results revealed that patients with l allele of HTTRLP showed a greater improvement than those without l allele on the overall brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) (P = 0.025). But no such relationship was found for the HTTVNTR. In haplotype analysis, the frequency of L-12 haplotype showed a significant difference between the responder group and the non-responder group (P = 0.005). Our study has, for the first time, produced evidence that the potential for therapy in patients with schizophrenia is related to the HTTRLP polymorphism in the HTT gene and haplotype L-12 may help to predict risperidone treatment efficiency. © 2007.

33947529741	Clinical study on safety of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation in both donors and recipients	Aim: To investigate the safety of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (A-A LDLT) in both donors and recipients. Methods: From January 2002 to July 2006, 50 cases of A-A LDLT were performed at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, consisting of 47 cases using right lobe graft without middle hepatic vein (MHV), and 3 cases using dual grafts (one case using two left lobe, 2 using one right lobe and one left lobe). The most common diagnoses were hepatitis B liver cirrosis, 30 (60%) cases; and hepatocellular carcinoma, 15 (30%) cases in adult recipients. Among them, 10 cases had the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) with a score of more than 25. Donor screening consisted of reconstruction of the hepatic blood vessels and biliary system with 3-dimension computed tomography and volumetry of whole liver and right liver volume. Various improved surgical techniques were adopted in the procedures for both donors and recipients. Results: Forty-nine right lobes and 3 left lobes (2 left lobe grafts for 1 recipient, 1 left lobe graft for 1 recipient who had received right lobe graft donated by relative living donor) were obtained from 52 living donors. The 49 right lobe grafts, without MHV, weighed 400 g-850 g (media 550 g), and the ratio of graft volume to recipient standard liver volume (GV/SLV) ranged from 31.74% to 71.68% (mean 45.35%). All donors' remnant liver volume was over 35% of the whole liver volume. There was no donor mortality. With a follow-up of 2-52 mo (media 9 mo), among 50 adult recipients, complications occurred in 13 (26%) cases and 4 (8%) died postoperatively within 3 mo. Their 1-year actual survival rate was 92%. Conclusion: When preoperative CT volumetry shows volume of remnant liver is more than 35%, the ratio of right lobe graft to recipients standard liver volume exceeding 40%, A-A LDLT using right lobe graft without MHV should be a very safe procedure for both donors and recipients, otherwise dual grafts liver transplantation should be considered. © 2007 The WJG Press.

34250204441	Introduction of Microsurgical Technique to Biliary Reconstruction in Living Donor Liver Transplantation	Objective: High rates of biliary complications continue to be a major concern associated with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). In this article, we report our experience of applying a microsurgical technique to biliary reconstruction in LDLT. Patients and Methods: From January 2001 to December 2005, 32 patients underwent LDLTs (8 children and 24 adults). Biliary reconstruction for 43 hepatic duct orifices in the 32 donor grafts 21 duct-to-duct anastomoses, and 22 cholangiojejunostomies. Nine cholangiojejunostomies in 4 donors used a microsurgical technique under an operative microscope. Results: Biliary complications weren't observed among the cases of cholangiojejunostomy using a microsurgical technique. An anastomotic biliary leakage was found in a recipient with cholangiojejunostomy performed using a surgical loupe and a biliary stricture in another recipient who underwent duct-to-duct anastomoses using a surgical loupe. Conclusion: Introduction of a microsurgical technique for biliary reconstruction in LDLT, especially using an operating microscope in the setting of hepatico-jejunostomy for small hepatic duct (≤2 mm in diameter), showed good results. We believe that using the operative microscope for biliary reconstruction could reduce the incidence of biliary complications associated with LDLT. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34250223001	Impact of Pretransplant MELD Score on Posttransplant Outcome in Orthotopic Liver Transplantation for Patients with Acute-on-Chronic Hepatitis B Liver Failure	This study was performed to evaluate the usefulness of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score in comparison with the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score to predict short-term postoperative survival and 3-month morbidity among patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from all patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation in our unit from December 1999 to November 2005, on the admission day MELD and CTP scores were calculated for each patient according to the original formula. We evaluated the accuracy of MELD and CTP to predict postoperative short-term survival and 3-month morbidity using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively. Results: Seven of 42 patients died within 3-months follow-up. The MELD scores for nonsurvivors (32.97 ± 7.11) were significantly higher than those for survivors (24.90 ± 4.96; P < .05), CTP scores were significantly higher, too (12.57 ± 0.98, 11.51 ± 1.17; P < .05). ROC analysis identified the MELD best cut-off point to be 25.67 to predict postoperative morbidity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.841; sensitivity = 85.7%; specificity = 60.0%), and the CTP best cut-off point was 11.5 (AUC = 0.747; sensitivity = 85.7%; specificity = 54.3%). MELD score was superior to CTP score to predict postoperative short-term survival and 3-month morbidity among patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. Conclusion: MELD score was an objective predictive system and more efficient than CTP score to evaluate the risk of 3-month morbidity and short-term prognosis in patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

34548671460	Quantitative assessment of the effect of angiotensinogen gene polymorphisms on the risk of coronary heart disease	BACKGROUND - Angiotensinogen, a key protein in the renin-angiotensin system, plays an important role in cardiovascular hemostasis. Many studies have examined the association between polymorphisms in the angiotensinogen gene and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but the results have been inconsistent. METHODS AND RESULTS - We performed a meta-analysis of 43 associations studies on 2 angiotensinogen polymorphisms (M235T and T174M) and risk of CHD published before March 2007, including a total of 13 478 CHD cases and 17 024 controls. We also explored potential sources of heterogeneity. In a combined analysis, the summary per-allele odds ratio for CHD of the M235T polymorphism was 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.19). However, when the analyses were restricted to 4 larger studies (n >500 cases), the summary per-allele odds ratio was 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.04). Our analyses detected a possibility of publication bias with an overestimate of the true association by smaller studies. A meta-analysis of studies on the 174M variant showed no significant overall association with CHD, yielding a per-allele odds ratio of 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.22). CONCLUSIONS - This meta-analysis suggested an overall weak association between the M235T polymorphism and CHD risk. However, the association was not observed in several larger studies, suggesting a publication bias. Additional very large-scale studies are warranted to provide conclusive evidence on the effects of the angiotensinogen gene and other genes within the renin-angiotensin system on risk of CHD. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.

34948832771	Association of AKT1 gene polymorphisms with risk of schizophrenia and with response to antipsychotics in the Chinese population	Background: A number of studies have pointed to the involvement of AKT signaling pathways in the etiology of schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the AKT1 gene is involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and whether it affects therapeutic outcomes in the Chinese population. Method: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped among 384 schizophrenic patients (DSM-IV criteria) and 384 healthy controls from the Chinese population. We systematically analyzed the association of the AKT1 gene with schizophrenia on the basis of sex, age at onset, therapeutic response to typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics, and presence or absence of extrapyramidal syndrome. The study was conducted from May 2004 to June 2006. Results: We found a positive association of the G allele of the SNP marker rs3803300 with schizophrenia (p = .003), both in early-onset and late-onset subjects, and that a haplotype A-G-C-G-A constructed by the 5 SNPs showed significant association (p = .00004886). However, we found no relationship between any of the 5 SNP markers and therapeutic response to typical and atypical antipsychotics and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome. Conclusions: Our study suggests that AKT1 is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in the Chinese population and that the AKT1 gene may play no major role in the therapeutic response to antipsychotics or in chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome.

35648975466	Hepatic venous outflow reconstruction in right lobe graft without middle hepatic vein	Background: We explored the pattern of hepatic venous outflow reconstruction in adult right lobe (segments V5-8) living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) without the middle hepatic vein (MHV). The difficulty and challenge of LDLT without MHV is the outflow reconstruction of hepatic vein. We have modified the surgical procedure and here report the results. Methods: Retrospective analysis was made of the clinical data of 50 recipients who underwent LDLT using right lobe without MHV. Results: Forty-five recipients (90.0%, 45/50) are alive at median follow up of 10 months. The graft-to-recipient bodyweight ratio (GRWR) was 1.21% ± 0.49% (range, 0.72% to 1.98%). The recipients of GRWR <0.8% (extra-small graft), 0.8% < GRWR < 1.2% (small graft) and GRWR >1.2% (ideal graft) were 14, 27 and 9, respectively. Total ratio venous outflowreconstruction of V5, V8 and inferior right hepatic vein was 66.0% (33/50). The overall incidence of small-for-size syndrome was 10.0% (n = 5), the overall graft survival rate was 92.0% (46/50). Conclusions: Graft function and survival rates are not only influenced by graft size, but also by hepatic venous outflow reconstruction; the 'multiple-opening vertical anastomosis' for reconstruction of hepatic vein outflow was used when the GRWR was smaller than 1.2%. This technique alleviates surgical risk in living donors, ensures excellent venous drainage, and reduces the incidence of small-for-size syndrome. © 2007 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

37149020401	Complications in the Right Lobe Adult Living Donor: Single-Center Experience in China	Introduction and Objective: Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been accepted as an established treatment modality for end-stage liver diseases to alleviate the shortage of cadaveric organs. Reported complication rates for right lobe adult living donors vary, but are estimated to be approximately 35% with a surgical mortality rate of approximately 0.3%. Our objective was to evaluate the complications in right lobe adult living donors in a single center. Materials and Methods: This retrospective review includes 62 adult living donors who underwent right hemi-hepatectomy between January 2002 and December 2006. Eighteen donors were men and 44 were women (range, 18-65 years; median age, 36 years). The mean follow-up time for the donors was 16 months (range, 3 months-4 years). Results: All donors were alive and well at the end of the study period. Complications included pleural effusion (n = 6; 9.68%), bile leaks (n = 3; 4.84%), wound infection (n = 2; 3.23%), pneumonia (n = 2; 3.23%), chyle leak (n = 1; 1.61%), intra-abdominal bleeding (n = 1; 1.61%), subphrenic effusion (n = 1; 1.61%), portal vein thrombosis (n = 1; 1.61%), and chylothorax (n = 1; 1.61%). There was no donor mortality, and the overall complication rate was 29%. Conclusions: The overall complication rate in the right lobe adult living donor was 29% in our center; there was no donor mortality. These complications could be avoided or overcome through intensive postoperative surveillance. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

37849034166	Measures for increasing the safety of donors in living donor liver transplantation using right lobe grafts	Background: The safety of donors in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) should be the primary consideration. The aim of this study was to report our experience in increasing the safety of donors in LDLTs using right lobe grafts. Methods: We retrospectively studied 37 living donors of right lobe grafts from January 2002 to March 2006. The measures for increasing the safety of donors in LDLT included carefully selected donors, preoperative evaluation by ultrasonography, angiography and computed tomography; and necessary intraoperative cholangiography and ultrasonography. Right lobe grafts were obtained using an ultrasonic dissector without inflow vascular occlusion on the right side of the middle hepatic vein. The standard liver volume and the ratio of left lobe volume to standard liver volume were calculated. Results: There was no donor mortality in our group. Postoperative complications only included bile leakage (1 donor), biliary stricture (1) and portal vein thrombosis (1). All donors recovered well and resumed their previous occupations. In recipients, complications included acute rejection (2 patients), hepatic artery thrombosis (1), bile leakage (1), intestinal bleeding (1), left subphrenic abscess (1) and pulmonary infection (1). The mortality rate of recipients was 5.4% (2/37); one recipient with pulmonary infection died from multiple organ failure and another from occurrence of primary disease. Conclusions: The first consideration in adult-to-adult LDLT is the safety of donors. The donation of a right lobe graft is safe for adults if the remnant hepatic vasculature and bile duct are ensured, and the volume of the remnant liver exceeds 35% of the total liver volume. © 2007, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

33344460983	Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation using right lobe graft: Report of 24 cases	Objective: To investigate the safety and feasibility of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (A-A LDLT) using right lobe graft. Methods: From January 2005 to December 2005, 24 patients, 22 males and 2 females, aged 20-53, with the underlying diseases of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Budd-Chiari syndrome, underwent A-A LDLT using right lobe graft. During the second period, including 22 cases, modified techniques were adopted, e.g. direct anastomosis of the right hepatic vein (RHV) and inferior vena cava was performed in all 22 cases, reconstruction of inferior right hepatic vein was performed on 9 cases, and reconstruction of tributaries of middle hepatic vein by interposing a vein graft on 10 cases so as to provide sufficient venous outflow. Results: No sever complication and death was found in the donors. The graft and recipient weight ratio was 0.72%-1.17%, being < 1.0% among 19 cases and being < 0.8% among 4 cases. During the first period one of the 2 patients suffered from stenosis at the anastomotic stoma of the right hepatic vein, and the other patient suffered from small-for-size syndrome and died. During the second period modified techniques were adopted and no more small-for-size syndrome occurred. Conclusion: With the modified techniques, A-A LDLT has become a relative safe procedure.

34249847429	Analysis of fifty adult to adult living donor liver transplantation	Objective To investigate the safety of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (A-ALDLT), which means how to make the life safeties of both adult donor and recipient who are transplanted with the right lobe of liver. Methods From January 2002 to July 2006. 50 A-ALDLT were performed at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, which consisted of 47 cases with right lobe graft without middle hepatic vein (MHV) and 3 cases with the dual graft of liver lobes (one cases with two left lobes, 2 with one right and one left lobe). The majority of adult liver recipients suffered originally from the hepatitis B with liver cirrhosis (60%), hepatocellular carcinoma (30%) as primary diseases, and 10 cases among them had the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score more than 25. The grafting livers of donors were routinely scanned under three-dimensional computed tomography (CT), and the scan image data were computed for volume reconstructions of whole and right lobe livers. Various innovative surgical techniques were adopted for donor and recipient procedure operation. Results From 52 living donors, 49 right liver lobes and 3 left lobes were obtained. The 49 right lobe grafts without MHV were weighed to 400-850 g (medial 550 g). The ratios of the graft volumes to the volumes of recipient standard livers (GV/SLV) were ranged from 31.74% to 71.68% (mean, 45.35%). All of the donor remnant liver volumes were larger 35% of the whole liver volume. There was no donor mortality occurring, but 7- 69% of donors undergoing complications in 50 adult recipients. With postoperatively following up 2-52 months (medial 9 months), 13 (26%) occurred various complications and 4 (8%) died within 3 months. Their 1-y actual survival rate was 92%. Conclusion When preoperative CT volume showed the volume of remnant liver is greater than 35% of whole liver volume, and the ratio of right lobe graft volume to recipient's standard live volume is more than 40%, A-ALDLT using right lobe graft should be very safe procedure for both donors and recipients, otherwise the dual graft liver transplantation should be considered.

34249849105	Clinical distribution and antibiotic resistance of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli infection after liver transplantation	Objective To investigate the epidemiology of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infections after liver transplantation, and to analyze the antibiotic susceptibility to major pathogens. Methods A retrospective survey was conducted to 292 patients who underwent liver transplantation in the period of January 2004 and September 2006. With MicroScan Walkaway- 40 Automatic System, the non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infection was analyzed for the identification of pathogens and susceptibility to drugs. Results Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infection was identified in 33.9% of 292 patients after liver transplantation. A total of 99 non-duplicate strains were isolated. The infection was frequently identified from respiratory tract. biliary tract, blood stream and intra-abdominal cavity. The top 3 pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Those non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were usually resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. Conclusion The non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli of postoperative infections in liver transplantation recipients are mostly multi-drug resistant. The microbiological surveillance is important for guiding clinical therapy.

34248595645	Perioperative management of primary liver cancer	Aim: To minimize the complications and mortality and improve the survival in primary liver cancer (PLC) patients undergoing hepatic resection. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2143 PLC patients treated from January 1990 to January 2004. The patients were divided into two groups using January 1997 as a cut-off. Small tumor size (< 5 cm), preoperative redox tolerance index (RTI), vascular control method, and postoperative arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR) were used as indicators of surgical outcome. Results: Small tumors had less complications and lower mortality and higher overall survival rate. Use of RTI for selecting patients and types of hepatectomy, reduced complications (21.1% vs 11.0%) and mortality (1.6% vs 0.3%). The half liver vascular occlusion protocol (n = 523) versus the Pringle method (n = 476) showed that the former significantly reduced the postoperative complications (25.8% vs 11.9%) and mortality (2.3% vs 0.6%) respectively, and cut mean hospital stay was 3.5 d. Postoperative AKBR was a reliable indicator of the energy status in survivors. Conclusion: RTI is of value in predicting hepatic functional reserve, half liver occlusion could protect the residual liver function, and AKBR measurement is a simple and accurate means of assessing the state of postoperative metabolism. Optimal perioperative management is an important factor for minimizing complications and mortality in patients undergoing hepatic resection. © 2007 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

34249852636	Exploration of surgical technique used to donor hepatectomy for adult to adult living donor liver transplantation with right liver lobe graft	Objective To study the surgical technique of donor hepatectomy for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methods From March 2002 to July 2006, the donor hepatectomy was performed to 47 LDLT without middle hepatic vein (MHV) at West China Hospital. The donors were assessed by 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) preoperatively. Techniques of cut-ultrasound aspiration (cusa) and electrocautery combining with bipolar coagulation were applied to donor hepatectomy. During the parenchymal transection of donor liver, all major (diameter>5 mm) outflows of segment V (V5), segment VIII (V8) and inferior right hepatic vein (IRHV) were preserved for future reconstruction. Results No severe complications and death occurred in all the donors. The median operative time was 425 min (range 380-620 min), the average blood loss during the operation was 345 mL (range 250-735 mL), the average intraoperative self-transfusion was 263 mL (range 0-500 mL), but 4 cases of donors needed the blood transfusion intraoperatively. Since 2004, it has become a routine not to transfuse blood into the donor during grafting operation of liver. Complications of liver graft operation occurred in 4 patients including wound steatolysis (2 cases), chyle leakage (1 case), portal vein thrombosis (1 case), and of all 47 donors, 27 cases with big V5, V8 or IRHV were made the vein outflow ducts reconstructed. All operated donors were followed up until today, and all work and live as usual. Conclusion During the donor operation, it is safe and reliable to the hepatectomy performed by the CUSA and electrocautery combining with bipolar coagulation. And the enough outflow reconstruction for LDLT without MHV have made the donor hepatectomy operation become excellent, which suggests that the surgical operative method should be applied and popularized.

34249858494	Postoperative safety of liver donors with positive anti-hepatitis B core antibodies for adult to adult living donor liver transplantation	Objective To evaluate the safety of liver donors with positive anti-HBc for adult to adult living-donor liver transplantation. Methods Between March 2003 and July 2005, 52 donors underwent hepatectomy for living-donor liver transplantation at the West China Hospital. Among them, four were anti-HBc-positive, 48 were anti-HBc-negative. The perioperative clinical profiles of the two groups were compared which included the Hepatitis B indicators, liver functions and growth of liver after operation. Results No significant differences were found between the two groups of donors in liver function, hepatitis B indicators, comorbidity, regeneration of remnant livers and length of stay in hospitals. Conclusion Anti-HBc-positive donors do not have higher risks than anti-HBc-negative donors for liver transplantation.

34249861897	Technological refinement to reconstruction of liver outflow vein in living donor right liver lobe graft	Objective To explore the reconstructed pattern of hepatic outflow vein in right lobe without middle hepatic vein (MHV) of adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methods The retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 47 recipients who underwent the operation in LDLT including the outflow vein reconstructed in right liver lobe without MHV. The right hepatic veins (RHV) in transplanted donor liver were anastomosed to a triangular opening in the recipient's inferior vena cava (IVC); the inferior right hepatic veins (IRHV) of significant size that had been preserved were anastomosed directly to the IVC. The great saphenous vein (CSV) as interposition connector was used to reconstruct the significant tributaries (V5, V8) of MHV, the other end of interposition was anastomosed with IVC. Results No death occurred in all the donors. Of 47 recipients, complications occurred in 9 recipients including the hepatic vein stricture (1 case), small-for-size liver syndrome (1 case), hepatic artery thrombosis (1 case), intestinal bleeding (1 case), bile leakage (2 cases), left subphrenic abscess (1 case) and pulmonary infection (2 cases). Three cases died of the small-for-size liver syndrome (1 case) and multiple system organ failure (2 cases). The total rate of outflow veins reconstructed for V5, V8 and IRHV was 65.96% (31/47). the rate of one-vein reconstruction, two-vein reconstruction or three-vein reconstruction was 36.17%, 21.28% or 8.51% respectively. The successive postoperative investigation for vein grafts were performed by Color Doppler Ultrasound. Four cases experienced GSV graft obstruction or obliteration among the 31 cases in 7-25 days after operation, but extensive collateral circulation has established. Conclusion We used the "multiple-opening vertical anastomosis" to reconstruction of hepatic outflow vein. This technique alleviates the surgical risk on living donors, ensures the excellent venous drainage and prevents from the syndrome in small-for-size livers.

34250000631	Preliminary experience in adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation in a single center in China	The aim of this paper is to report the authors' experience in performing adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) by using a modified technique in using grafts of the right lobe of the liver. From January 2002 to September 2006, 56 adult patients underwent LDLT using right lobe grafts at the West China Hospital, Sichuan University Medical School, China. All patients underwent a modified operation designed to improve the reconstruction of the right hepatic vein (RHV) and the tributariers of the middle hepatic vein (MHV) by interposing a vessel graft, and by anastomosing the hepatic arteries and bile ducts. There were no severe complications or deaths in all donors. Fifty-two (92.8%) recipients survived the operations. Among the 56 recipients, complications were seen in 15 recipients (26.8%), including hepatic vein stricture (one case), small-for-size syndrome (one case), hepatic artery thrombosis (two cases), intestinal bleeding (one case), bile leakage (two cases), left subphrenic abscess (one case), renal failure (two cases) and pulmonary infection (five cases). Within three months after transplantation, four recipients (7.14%) died due to small-for-size syndrome (one case), renal failure (one case) and multiple organ failure (two cases). All patients underwent direct anastomoses of the RHV and the inferior vena cava (IVC), and in 23 cases, reconstruction of the right inferior hepatic vein was also done. In 24 patients, the reconstruction of the tributaries of the MHV was also done by interposing a vessel graft to provide sufficient venous outflow. Trifurcation of the portal vein was seen in nine cases. Thus, veno-plasty or separate anastomoses were performed. The graft and recipient body weight ratios (GRWR) were between 0.72% and 1.43%, and in three cases it was <0.8%. The graft weight to recipient standard liver volume ratios (GV/SLV) were between 31.86% and 71.68%, among which four cases had <40%. No "small-for-size syndrome" occurred. With modification of the surgical technique, especially in the reconstruction of the hepatic vein to provide sufficient venous outflow, living donor liver grafts in adults using the right lobe of the liver can become a relatively safe procedure and prevent the "small-for-size syndrome". © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2007.

34250158021	Small-for-Size Syndrome Secondary to Outflow Block of the Segments V and VIII Anastomoses-Successful Treatment With Trans-splenic Artery Embolization: A Case Report	Despite the rapid expansion of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in the adult population over the last few years, small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) has emerged as an important clinical problem. We have herein reported a patient who developed clinical evidence of prolonged cholestasis and intractable ascites after a small-for-size right lobe LDLT. The SFSS was attributed to outflow block of segments V and VIII anastomoses with severe portal overperfusion injury. It was successfully treated by reduction of portal pressure and blood flow after trans-splenic arterial ligation. We recommend that trans-splenic artery embolization, a technically simple procedure, be applied to treat portal overperfusion injury in SFSS. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34250167254	Hepatic venous outflow reconstruction in adult right lobe living donor liver transplantation without middle hepatic vein	Background: It is difficult and challenging to reconstruct hepatic venous outflow in adult right lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) without the middle hepatic vein (MHV). Excessive perfusion of the portal vein and venous outflow obstruction will lead to acute congestion of the graft, ultimately resulting in primary nonfunction. Although various reconstruction patterns have been explored in many countries, there is currently no clear consensus. In this study we describe a technique to prevent "chocking" of the graft at the outflow anastomosis with the inferior vena cava (IVC) in LDLT using right lobe graft without the MHV. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 55 recipients undergoing LDLT using right lobe grafts without the MHV or reconstruction of hepatic venous outflow. The donor's right hepatic vein (RHV) was anastomosed with a triangular opening of the recipient IVC; the inferior right hepatic vein (IRHV), if large enough, was anastomosed directly to the IVC. The great saphenous vein (GSV) was used for reconstruction of significant MHV tributaries. Results: No deaths occurred in any of the donors. Of the 55 recipients, complications occurred in 6, including hepatic vein stricture (1 case), small-for-size syndrome (1), hepatic artery thrombosis (1), intestinal bleeding (1), bile leakage (1), left subphrenic abscess and pulmonary infection (1). A total of three patients died, one from small-for-size syndrome and two from multiple system organ failure. Conclusions: The multiple-opening vertical anastomosis was reconstructed with hepatic vein outflow. This technique alleviates surgical risk of living donors, ensures excellent venous drainage, and prevents vascular thromboses and primary nonfunction.

41549148643	Following up of liver transplantation using dual left grafts from living donors - One case	Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using right lobe graft was advocated to treat adult patients who could not receive a timely cadaveric graft. The major limitation of adult-to-adult LDLT using right lobe graft is the safety of the donors. Adult-to-adult LDLT using dual left grafts was performed for one patient with end-stage liver disease in our division. Both donors and recipient underwent a full recovery from the operation without persistent complications. Two left dual grafts from two living donors can help alleviate the pressure of organ shortage, prevent the small-for-size problem and yet secure the safety of the donors. © H.G.E.

77954144181	Convergent Evidence Shows a Positive Association of Interleukin-1 Gene Complex Locus with Susceptibility to Schizophrenia in the Caucasian population	Recent genetic studies have revealed that the Interleukin-1 (IL1) gene complex (IL1 alpha, IL1 beta and IL1 receptor antagonist) is associated with schizophrenia, but contradictory findings have also been reported. We investigated the association of the IL1 gene complex locus and schizophrenia using meta-analytic techniques, covering all published data up to January 2010, to restrict to the most commonly reported 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). We also explored potential sources of heterogeneity and to investigate whether ancestry and study design moderated any association. The combined allele-wise odds ratio (OR) for schizophrenia of the rs16944 (IL1B gene; T-511C) polymorphism was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77to 0.96).When applying stratified analysis to this polymorphism, the pooled allele-wise OR was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.97) in 10 population-based studies and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.99) in Caucasian samples. In a stratified analysis of the rs1143634 (IL1B gene; T3953C) polymorphism, the pooled genotype-wise results in a dominant model were also statistically significant both in a population-based study subgroup with summary OR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.99) and a Caucasian population subgroup with summary OR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.97). Neither combined nor stratified analyses found any association of the rs1800587 (IL1A gene; T-889C) or rs1794068 (IL1RA Gene; IL1RN_86 bp; T/C) with schizophrenia susceptibility. Our study suggests the IL1B gene or the IL1 gene complex may play a moderate role in the etiology of schizophrenia in the Caucasian population. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77954799781	Prevention and treatment of biliary tract complications following adult living donor liver transplantation	Objective: To investigate the prevention and treatment of biliary tract complications following adult-adult living donor liver transplantation (A-A LDLT). Methods: One hundred and eight patients, aged 38 (18-63), underwent A-A LDLT, including transplantation of the right liver graft without middle hepatic vein (MHV) in 102 cases and dual graft transplantation in 6 cases (of left lobe from relative in 1 case, of right lobe + left lobe from relative in 3 cases, of right lobe from relative + cadaveric left lobe in 2 cases). Preoperative 3-dimensional computerized tomography (3D CT) and intra-operative cholangiography were employed to reveal the state of the liver, caution was exercised to protect the peripheral vasculature of the right hepatic duct during resection. The bile duct was reconstructed by ducl-to-duct (D-D) biliary anastomosis or Roux-en-Y anastomosis of the hepatic duet and jejunum (H-J). Results: Twenty-four of the 108 patients (22.2%) suffered from complications, including bile leakage (n = 4), cutting surface bile leakage (n = 1), and anastomotic biliary stricture (n = 3), etc. Seven donors (6.3%) suffered from complications too, including 2 cases of bile leakage from the remnant cut surface. All the biliary tract complications were properly managed with good outcomes, except for 1 case of recipient death. Conclusion: Measures such as improvement of pre- and intra-surgical examinations and assessments, choice of appropriate approach of biliary tract reconstruction, employment of subtle operations of microscopic procedures, and timely detection and management of complications may reduce the incidence and mortality of biliary tract complications following A-A LDLT.

4344579350	Prolongation of liver allograft survival by dendritic cells modified with NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides	Aim: To induce the tolerance of rat liver allograft by dendritic cells (DCs) modified with NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). Methods: Bone marrow (BM)-derived DCs from SD rats were propagated in the presence of GM-CSF or GM-CSF+IL-4 to obtain immature DCs or mature DCs. GM-CSF+IL-4-propagated DCs were treated with double-strand NF-κB decoy ODNs containing two NF-κB binding sites or scrambled ODNs to ascertain whether NF-κB decoy ODNs might prevent DC maturation. GM-CSF-propagated DCs, GM-CSF+NF-κB decoy ODNs or scrambled ODNs-propagated DCs were treated with LPS for 18 h to determine whether NF-κB decoy ODNs could prevent LPS-induced IL-12 production in DCs. NF-κB binding activities, costimulatory molecule (CD40, CD80, CD86) surface expression, IL-12 protein expression and allostimulatory capacity of DCs were measured with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), flow cytometry, Western blotting, and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), respectively. GM-CSF-propagated DCs, GM-CSF+IL-4 -propagated DCs, and GM-CSF+NF-κB decoy ODNs or scrambled ODNs-propagated DCs were injected intravenously into recipient LEW rats 7 d prior to liver transplantation and immediately after liver transplantation. Histological grading of liver graft rejection was determined 7 d after liver transplantation. Expression of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ mRNA in liver graft and in recipient spleen was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Apoptosis of liver allograft-infiltrating cells was measured with TUNEL staining. Results: GM-CSF-propagated DCs, GM-CSF+NF-κB decoy ODNs-propagated DCs and GM-CSF+ scrambled ODNs-propagated DCs exhibited features of immature DCs, with similar low level of costimulatory molecule(CD40, CD80, CD86) surface expression, absence of NF-κB activation, and few allocostimulatory activities. GM-CSF+IL-4-propagated DCs displayed features of mature DCs, with high levels of costimulatory molecule (CD40, CD80, CD86) surface expression, marked NF-κB activation, and significant allocostimulatory activity. NF-κB decoy ODNs completely abrogated IL-4-induced DC maturation and allocostimulatory activity as well as LPS-induced NF-κB activation and IL-12 protein expression in DCs. GM-CSF+NF-κB decoy ODNs-propagated DCs promoted apoptosis of liver allograft-infiltrating cells within portal areas, and significantly decreased the expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ mRNA but markedly elevated IL-4 mRNA expression both in liver allograft and in recipient spleen, and consequently suppressed liver allograft rejection, and promoted liver allograft survival. Conclusion: NF-κB decoy ODNs-modified DCs can prolong liver allograft survival by promoting apoptosis of graft-infiltrating cells within portal areas as well as down-regulating IL-2 and IFN-γ mRNA and up-regulating IL-4 mRNA expression both in liver graft and in recipient spleen.

44449172912	BDNF gene is a genetic risk factor for schizophrenia and is related to the chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in the Chinese population	BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to a family of the neurotrophin, which plays important roles in the neurodevelopment of dopaminergic-related systems and interacts with meso-limbic dopaminergic systems involved in the therapeutic response to antipsychotics. Functional experiments have suggested that BDNF may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we genotyped two important functional polymorphisms in the BDNF gene using a sample of Han Chinese patients consisting of 340 schizophrenic patients and 343 healthy controls. We found a statistical difference in the 232-bp allele distribution of the BDNF gene (GT)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism between the schizophrenic patients and controls. In early onset patients, the 234-bp allele had a risk role. For the chlorpromazine- induced extrapyramidal syndrome, the 230-bp allele and the 234-bp allele acted in opposite directions, that is, patients with the 230-bp allele of the (GT)n polymorphism exhibited a lower degree of induced extrapyramidal syndrome. Haplotype-based analysis also revealed a very important risk haplotype (P=0.0000226546). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BDNF plays an important role in the susceptibility to schizophrenia and that the (GT)n repeat polymorphism of the BDNF gene may be an independent contributor to the chlorpromazine treatment-sensitive form of schizophrenia. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

44649135121	Reducing biliary complications in adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation using right lobe graft: Experience of 124 cases	The aim of this paper is to summarize our experience of using right lobe liver grafts to reduce biliary complications in adult-to-adult (A-A) living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). From January 2002 to October 2007, 124 adult patients underwent living donor liver transplantation using right lobe grafts at the West China Hospital, Sichuan University Medical School, China. There was no death in all donors. Biliary reconstruction for 178 hepatic duct orifices from 124 donor grafts was performed which included 106 reconstructions of duct-to-duct anastomoses and 72 cholangiojejunostomy. Nine recipients had biliary complications including six bile leakages (four from the anastomotic site and two from the cut surface of the liver graft) and three biliary strictures. With the improved techniques for biliary reconstruction, we have achieved good results in 124 recipients of A-A LDLT. We ascribe our success to the introduction of microsurgical techniques and the use of fixed operators which help in decreasing the biliary complications of LDLT. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.

46049087328	Postoperative complications after liver transplantation with cavoportal hemitransposition	Background: Extensive portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in the recipient of liver transplantation increases postoperative morbidity and mortality. Cavoportal hemitransposition (CPHT) has been described as a salvage technique in the presence of extensive portal and superior mesenteric venous thrombosis. Methods: We report three patients who underwent this procedure, review the literature, and discuss the postoperative complications of CPHT. Results: Fifty-six patients with extensive PVT who underwent CPHT have been reported. Seventeen patients have died to date. The common complications of CPHT were ascites (55.4%), renal insufficiency (48.2%), variceal bleeding (30.4%), or thrombosis of cavoportal anastomosis or portal branch (14.3%). Conclusion: CPHT is a salvage measure to maintain the patency of portal inflow to the liver graft in the presence of extensive PVT. © 2008, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

45449086258	Arterial Complications After Living-Related Liver Transplantation: Single-Center Experience From West China	Vascular complications after liver transplantation remain a major source of morbidity and mortality for recipients. In particular, patients receiving living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) experience a higher rate of vascular complications owing to the complex vascular reconstruction. Between July 2001 and December 2005, LRLTs were performed in our center on 33 patients with end-stage liver diseases. The 23 men and 10 women had a mean age of 32.6 ± 11.3 years (range = 5 to 58 years). Of the 33 patients, the percentage of vascular complications was 9.09% (3 cases), including hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT), hepatic arterial stenosis (HAS), or hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm (HAP) in one patient, respectively. No portal vein or hepatic vein complication occurred in our patients. Thrombectomy was performed in the patient with thrombosis. The patient with stenosis was treated with balloon angioplasty and endoluminal stent placement. The pseudoaneurysm was also successfully embolized to restore the blood flow toward the donor liver. Mean follow-up for all patients after LRLT was 18.0 ± 5.4 months. The overall postoperative 30-day mortality rate was 6.06% (2/33). The 1-year survival rate was 86.36% in 22 patients with benign diseases and 72.73% in 11 patients with malignant diseases. However, no death was associated with vascular complications. Careful preoperative evaluation and intraoperative microsurgical technique for hepatic artery reconstructions are the keys to prevent vascular complications following LRLT. Immediate surgical intervention is required for acute vascular complications, whereas late complications may be treated by balloon angioplasty and endoluminal stent placement. Embolization may be a safe and effective approach in the treatment of a pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

45449107202	University of California at San Francisco Criteria Can Be Applied to Living Donor Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Single-Center Preliminary Results in 27 Patients	Background: Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) can provide life-saving therapy for many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who otherwise would succumb due to tumor progression. However, donor risk must be balanced against potential recipient benefit. Methods: From January 2002 to December 2006, a total of 27 LDLT were performed for HCC patients in our center, including 25 right lobe grafts, and 2 dual grafts. Twenty-four (88.89%) met the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) criteria, whereas 3 (11.11%) did not. Results: Of our 29 donors, the overall complication rate was 17.24%. Two (6.90%) experienced major complications including intra-abdominal bleeding and portal vein thrombosis in 1, respectively; 3 (10.34%) experienced minor complications: wound steatosis, pleural effusion, and transient chyle leakage in 1, respectively. We did not observe any donor mortality; all donors fully recovered and returned to their previous occupations. No recipient developed small-for-size syndrome. The overall HCC patient survival rates at 1- and 3-years were 84.01% and 71.40%, respectively, similar to those of patients undergoing LDLT for various nonmalignant diseases during the same period (P > .05). Conclusions: Although further study is needed to fully assess the risks and benefits of LDLT for both HCC patients and donors, our preliminary results suggested that LDLT offered an acceptable chance and duration of survival for HCC patients. It was not only a relatively safe procedure provided that every effort was taken to minimize donor morbidities, but also beneficial for HCC recipients. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

45449109396	Surgical Procedures for Management of Right Portal Venous Branching in Right Lobe Living Donor Liver Transplantation	Objective: This study sought to describe the surgical management of right portal venous (PV) branches encountered among 104 cases of right lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methods: From January 2002 to September 2007, we performed 104 cases of right-lobe LDLT including 11-donors who had anomalous right portal venous branches (APVB). One recipient had PV sponginess hemangioma. The donor right PV branches were type I in 93 cases, type II (trifurcation) in nine cases, and type III in two cases. Except one narrow bridge of tissue excision, the PV branches were transected on the principal of donor priority: PV branches were excised approximately 2 to 3 mm from the confluence while leaving the donor's main portal vein and confluence intact. In type II APVB, donor PV branches were obtained with two separate openings in six cases; with two separate openings joined as a common orifice at the back table in two cases, with one common opening with a narrow bridge of tissue in one case. In type III APVB, the donor right anterior and posterior PV branches were obtained with separate openings. The donor right PV branches with one common opening in 92 cases of type I PV branches and a joined common orifice in three cases of type II APVB were anastomosed to the recipient's main portal vein or to right branching. As the unavailable recipient PV for sponginess hemangioma, one case of type I right PV branches was end-to-end anastomosed to one of the variceal lateral veins of about 1 cm diameter in a pediatric patient. The PV were reconstructed as double anastomoses in six type II APVB and in one type III APVB obtained with two separate PV openings. In the another type III APVB reconstruction, we successfully utilized a novel U-shaped vein graft interposition. Results: The type II APVB donor receiving a narrow bridge of portal vein tissue excision developed portal vein thrombosis on the third postoperative day and underwent reexploration for thrombectomy. There were no vascular complications, such as portal vein thrombosis or stricture among other donors or all recipients. The velocity of blood flow in the U-graft was normal. The anastomosis between the type I donor right portal vein and recipient variceal lateral vein was unobstructed. Conclusion: Right PV branches should be excised on the principal of donor priority while leaving the donor's main portal vein and confluence intact. Single anastomoses was the fundamental procedure of right branch reconstruction. Double anastomoses could be used as the main management for type II and type III APVB reconstruction. U-graft interposition may be a potential procedure for type III APVB reconstruction. Single anastomoses between the donor right portal vein and the recipient variceal lateral vein may be performed when recipient portal vein is unavailable. These innovations for excision and reconstruction of right PV branches were feasible, safe, and had good outcomes. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

57649134546	Preliminary Experience With Indications for Liver Transplantation for Hepatolithiasis	Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the indications for liver transplantation among patients with hepatolithiasis. Patients and Methods: Data from 1431 consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment from January 2000 to December 2006 were retrospectively collected for analysis. Surgical procedures included T-tube insertion combined with intraoperative cholangioscopic removal of intrahepatic stones, hepatectomy, cholangiojejunostomy, and liver transplantation. Results: Nine hundred sixty-one patients who had a stone located in the left or right intrahepatic duct underwent hepatectomy or T-tube insertion combined with intraoperative cholangioscopic removal of intrahepatic stones. The rate of residual stones was 7.5%. Four hundred seventy patients who had a stone located in the bilateral intrahepatic ducts underwent surgical procedures other than liver transplantation; the rate of residual stones was 21.7%. Only 15 patients with hepatolithiasis underwent liver transplantation; they all survived. According to the degree of biliary cirrhosis, recipients were divided into 2 groups: a group with biliary decompensated cirrhosis (n = 7), or group with compensated cirrhosis or no cirrhosis (n = 8). There were significant differences in operative times, transfusion volumes, and blood losses between the 2 groups (P < .05). In the first group, 6 of 7 patients experienced surgical complications, and in the second, 8 recipients recovered smoothly with no complications. Health status, disability, and psychological wellness of all recipients (n = 15) were significantly improved at 1 year after transplantation compared with pretransplantation (P < .05). Conclusions: Liver transplantation is a possible method to address hepatolithiasis and secondary decompensated biliary cirrhosis or difficult to remove, diffusely distributed intrahepatic duct stones unavailable by hepatectomy, cholangiojejunostomy, and choledochoscopy. © 2008.

57049146355	Clinical significance of detailed preoperative evaluation on donors in right lobe living donor liver transplantation	Background/Aims: To investigate the clinical importance of detailed preoperative evaluation on donors of right lobe graft in living donor liver transplantation. Methodology: Between January 2001 and August 2006,106 potential donors were screened and evaluated. Evaluation focused on imaging study of hepatic vascular system, bile duct system, hepatic volumety and hepatic steatosis. Results: A total of 81 women (77.88%) and 23 men (22.12%) were evaluated with 51 donors participating. 55 potential donors were rejected. One donor failed to complete donation hepatectomy due to 40% macrovesicular steatosis found during operation. Variation of portal vein and hepatic artery could be found with evaluation. However, variations of hepatic veins especially the tributaries of middle hepatic vein and right hepatic bile duct showed on CT scan were not concordant with those at the cut surface of the liver graft. All the 50 right lobe grafts did not include middle hepatic vein, weighing 400-850g (media 550g), accounting for 31.74-71.68% (mean 45.35%) of standard liver volume (SLV) of the recipients. Donor morbidity, including all complications, was 8% with no mortality. All the donors recovered uneventfully. Conclusions: Detailed evaluation for hepatic lobar volume, vascular anatomy, virtual resection planes and morphologic features is of clinical importance in the selection of suitable donor in living right liver transplantation. © H.G.E.

63749105279	Estimation formula of standard liver volume for chinese adults	Objective To develop a formula estimating standard liver volume (SLV) for Chinese adults. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 115 cases of living donors for right lobes of liver transplants, not including the middle hepatic veins, in our hospital. The weights and volumes of the right lobe liver grafts were measured and recorded in the surgery. The actual total volume of liver was calculated from the right lobe graft volume divided by the proportion of the right lobe as indicated in the computed tomography. Simple linear regression analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis were undertaken to develop a formula for calculating the total liver volume, which was compared with other existing formulae. Results The liver donors had a mean age of (35. 9±. 9. 6) years old, and a female to male ratio of 60 : 55. The computed tomography detected a mean volume of (727. 47 ±136. 17) mL of right lobe, which occupied 55. 59% ± 6. 70% of the entire livers. The right lobe grafts had an actual volume of (581. 73±96. 137) mL and the donors had an actual total liver volume of (1053. 08± 167. 56) mL. A formula was developed for calculating the standard liver volumes SLV(mL) = ll. 508 X Body Weight + 334. 024. The HongKong formula underestimated, whereas all of the other formulae overestimated the actual liver volume of the donors. Conclusion The standard liver volume of Chinese adults can be calculated as: SLV=11. 508 X Body Weight+334. 024.

63049134789	Zinc Finger Protein A20 Promotes Regeneration of Small-for-Size Liver Allograft and Suppresses Rejection and Results in a Longer Survival in Recipient Rats	Background: Small-for-size liver allografts without immunosuppression have decreased survival compared with full-for-size grafts for the concomitant regeneration-induced accelerated rejection. This study was designed to examine the effect of zinc finger protein A20 on liver allograft regeneration and acute rejection using a high responder rat model (DA→Lewis) of 30% partial liver transplantation. Materials and methods: Adenovirus carrying the full length of A20 was introduced into liver grafts by ex vivo perfusion via the portal vein during preservation, physiological saline (PS), and empty Ad vector rAdEasy served as controls; then small-sized liver transplants were performed. Liver graft regeneration was assessed, as well as graft rejection, hepatocyte apoptosis, nuclear factor kappa B activation, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA expression in liver graft sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), infiltration of liver graft infiltrating mononuclear cells (LIMCs), and the subproportion of NK and NKT cells, activity of liver graft NK-like cells, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production, and animal survival. Results: Ex vivo transfer of the A20 gene resulted in overexpression of A20 protein in LSECs and hepatocytes 24 h after partial liver transplantation. Regeneration of the small-sized liver allograft was augmented by A20 overexpression, the DNA synthesis of hepatocytes on d 4 post-transplant was increased in A20 group compared with PS and rAdEasy groups (P < 0.01). Hepatocyte apoptosis was inhibited by A20 (P < 0.001). On d 4 after transplantation, histological examination revealed a more exiguous cellular infiltration and mild rejection in A20 group but a more vigorous cellular infiltration in the sinusoidal area and more severe rejection in PS and rAdEasy group. Nuclear factor kappa B activation and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA expression in LSECs were suppressed by A20 overexpression. Flow cytometry analysis showed a marked down-regulation of LIMCs number by A20, including more prominent decrease in the subproportion of NK and NKT cells. Activity of liver graft NK-like cells, IFN-γ mRNA expression in LIMCs, and serum IFN-γ protein level were also suppressed by A20 overexpression (P < 0.05), respectively. Survival days of A20 rats were longer than those of PS rats and rAdEasy rats (P < 0.01), whereas survival days of rAdEasy rats were shorter than those of PS rats (P < 0.01). Conclusions: These data suggest that A20 overexpression could effectively promote small-sized liver allograft regeneration, suppress rejection, and prolong survival of recipient rat. These effects of A20 could be related to an inhibition of LSECs activation, suppression of infiltration of LIMCs, and the subpopulations such as NK and NKT cells into liver graft, and inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

65349105489	Prenatal malnutrition and adult Schizophrenia: Further evidence from the 1959-1961 chinese famine	Objective: Evidence from the 1944-1995 Dutch Hunger Winter and the 1959-1961 Chinese famines suggests that those conceived or in early gestation during famines, have a 2-fold increased risk of developing schizophrenia in adult life. We tested the hypothesis in a second Chinese population and also determined whether risk differed between urban and rural areas. Method: The risk of schizophrenia was examined in Liuzhou prefecture of Guangxi autonomous region. Rates were compared among those conceived before, during, and after the famine years. Based on the decline in birth rates, we predicted that those born in 1960 and 1961 would have been exposed to the famine during conception or early gestation. All psychiatric case records in Liuzhou psychiatric hospital for the years 1971 through 2001 were examined and clinical/sociodemographic data extracted by psychiatrists blind to exposure status. Data on births and deaths in the famine years were also available, and cumulative mortality was estimated from later demographic surveys. Evidence of famine was verified, and results were adjusted for mortality. Relative risks (RRs) for schizophrenia were calculated for the region as a whole and for urban and rural areas separately. Results: Mortality-adjusted RR for schizophrenia was 1.5 (1960) and 2.05 (1961), respectively. However, the effect was exclusively from the rural areas RR = 1.68 (1960) and RR=2.25 (1961). Conclusions: We observe a 2-fold increased risk of schizophrenia among those conceived or in early gestation at the height of famine with risk related to severity of famine conditions.

67249116551	Initial Clinical Effect of Intraportal Insulin Administration on Liver Graft Regeneration in Adult Patients Underwent Living Donor Right Lobe Liver Transplantation	Objective: Insulin is one factor responsible for hepatotrophic regeneration in animal models. This study assessed the clinical effects of intraportal administration of insulin on liver graft regeneration in adult patients undergoing right lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methods: Between July 2005 and September 2007, 19 right lobe LDLT adult recipients voluntarily received posttransplant intraportal insulin administration. The present study describes 15 patients without postoperative vascular and bile duct complications, with more than 1 month survival and with complete clinical data who were enrolled to receive intraportal insulin therapy (group I; n = 15). Another consecutive 15 right lobe LDLT adult recipients without any stimulation regeneration who met the same criteria were enrolled in as noninsulin therapy control group (group NI; n = 15). Group I recipients were treated postoperatively with intraportal insulin infusion, as follows. An 18-gauge catheter was inserted into right gastro-omental vein during surgery, to administer regular insulin just after the operation at the rate of 2 U/h for 1 week. Graft volume (GV) was measured by computed tomography on postoperative days (POD) 7 and 30. Liver functions and serum insulin levels were also measured at POD 7 and POD 30. The liver graft regeneration rate was defined as ratio of posttransplant GV/harvested GV and posttransplant graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR)/operative GRWR. Results: The rate defined as ratio of POD 7 GV/harvested GV among group I was significantly greater than that of group NI (186.07 ± 35.40% vs 160.61 ± 22.11%; P < .05). The rate defined as ratio of POD 7 GRWR/operation GRWR was also significantly higher in group I than group NI (178.95 ± 35.84% vs 156.56 ± 18.53%; P < .05), whereas there was no significant difference in terms of regeneration rates at 1 month post-LDLT. Intraportal insulin administration may significantly downregulate POD 7 total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels (P < .05). These results suggested that intraportal insulin administration augmented liver regeneration during the first postoperative week by improving hepatic function in LDLT recipients. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67249119082	Using the Clavien Grading System to Classify the Complications of Right Hepatectomy in Living Donors	Introduction: The ratios of complications for living related liver donors after right hepatectomy differ widely among numerous single institutions. This study sought to use the Clavien classification system to define and graded the severity of these complications. Materials and methods: This study retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 160 consecutive living donor right hepatectomies performed between July 2002 and February 2008. Complications among living donors for liver transplantation after right hepatectomy were stratified according to the Clavien classification of postoperative surgical complications. Results: Fifty-two living donors displayed one or more perioperative complications Grade 1 complications were recorded in 18.1%; grade 2 in 6.3%; grade 3a in 5%; and grade 3b in 3.1%. Biliary complications were the most frequent. No donor mortality was present in this series. Conclusions: The Clavien grading system is useful to comparise surgical outcomes. This study demonstrated that donor right hepatectomy was a relatively safe procedure, but reducing donor complications after right hepatectomy has to be the first priority during the entire process of living related transplantation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67249132770	Can Liver Transplantation Achieve Similar Effects at High Altitudes Compared With Plains: Case Report	In orthotopic liver transplantation, particular emphasis must be placed on the unique physiologic, pathologic, and clinical features in residents living in areas at high vs low altitude. Hypobaric hypoxia, hypothermia, heavy radiation, high wind speed, and superevaporation at high altitudes may lead to various diseases. These features have progressive effects on cardiopulmonary and central nervous system functions. A high concentration of red cells in the circulation is likely to result in an increased incidence of hepatic artery and portal vein thrombosis. The immune system is also affected at high altitudes. Exposure to high altitude, which is associated with decreased oxygen pressure, can result in oxidation-reduction stress, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and related oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Our male patient with liver cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis B virus infectionunderwent orthotopic liver transplantation in Tibet with a successful outcome and good long-term survival. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67651091541	Prevent Small-For-Size Syndrome Using Dual Grafts in Living Donor Liver Transplantation	Background: The growing gap between the number of patients waiting for transplantation and available organs is still the main issue facing the transplant community. The major limitation of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is the small-for-size problem because of the concern of donor safety. We report preliminary experiences for preventing small-for-size syndrome using dual grafts from one right lobe without the middle hepatic vein and one left lateral segment in adult-to-adult LDLT. Methods: One hundred ten cases of adult-to-adult LDLT were performed in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 2002 to August 2007, and there were 16 small-for-size (SFS) grafts in all grafts. Dual grafts LDLT was performed for six patients with end-stage liver disease, consisting of five cases from one right lobe without the middle hepatic vein and one left lateral segment, and one case from two left lobes. Results: All living donors underwent a full recovery from the operation without persistent complications. Four recipients died of sepsis, one recipient received re-transplantation, and three recipients received transplenic artery embolization in the recipients with SFS grafts. All recipients with dual grafts displayed good graft function and a majority of grafts showed normal triangular-shape regeneration of their respective liver grafts. Only in one left lateral segment atrophy occurred, graft hepatectomy was not required. Conclusion: Dual grafts from one right lobe without the middle hepatic vein and one left lateral segment in adult-to-adult LDLT can prevent the small-for-size problem and yet secure the safety of the donors. © 2009.

68249135094	Outcomes of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation: A single center experience	Background: Since January 2002, adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (AALDLT) has gained increasing popularity in China in response to the shortage of cadaveric donor livers. This study presents a detailed analysis of the outcomes of AALDLT in a single center. Methods: A total of 70 patients underwent AALDLT at our center between January 2002 and January 2007. Among these, 67 patients received a right lobe graft without the middle hepatic vein and 3 patients received dual grafts. Three-dimensional volumetric computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging with angiography and cholangiography were performed preoperatively. Recipient operation time, intraoperative transfusion requirement, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay, liver function tests, coagulation tests and surgical outcomes were routinely investigated throughout this study. Results: All donors survived the procedure with an overall complication rate of 15.3%. Overall recipient 1-year survival and complication rates were 87.1% and 34.2%, respectively. Among the 70 cases, average graft recipient weight ratio was 0.94% (0.72%-1.43%) and average graft volume/ standard liver volume ratio was 46.42% (31.74%-71.68%). All residual liver volumes exceeded 35%. Liver function and coagulation recovered rapidly within the first 7 days after transplantation. Conclusions: AALDLT is a safe procedure for the donors and an effective therapy for patients with end-stage liver disease. Patient selection and timely decision-making for transplantation are essential in achieving good outcomes. With accumulation of experience in surgery and clinical management, timely feedback and proper modification, we foresee better outcomes in the future.

70350516389	Tacrolimus dosage requirements in living donor liver transplant recipients with small-for-size grafts	AIM: To investigate the tacrolimus dosage requirements and blood concentrations in adult-to-adult right lobe living donor liver transplantation (AALDLT) recipients with small-for-size (SFS) grafts. METHODS: During January 2007 and October 2008, a total of 54 cases of AALDLT with an observation period of 6 mo were enrolled in this study. The 54 patients were divided into two groups according to graft-recipient body weight ratio (GRBW): SFS grafts group (Group S, GRBW < 0.8%, n = 8) and non-SFS grafts group (Group N, GRBW ≥ 0.8%, n = 46). Tacrolimus 12-hour blood levels and doses were recorded during weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 and months 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in group S and group N. Meanwhile, acute rejection rates, liver and renal function test results, and the number of potentially interacting medications were determined at each interval in the two groups. A comparison of tacrolimus dosage requirements and blood levels were made weekly in the first month post-surgery, and monthly from months 2 to 6. RESULTS: There were no differences in the demographic characteristics, acute rejection rates, liver and renal function test results, or the number of potentially interacting medications administered between the two groups. The tacrolimus dosage requirements in group S were significantly lower than group N at 2 wk (2.8 ± 0.4 mg/d vs 3.6 ± 0.7 mg/d, P = 0.006), 3 wk (2.9 ± 0.7 mg/d vs 3.9 ± 0.8 mg/d, P = 0.008), 4 wk (2.9 ± 0.8 mg/d vs 3.9 ± 1.0 mg/d, P = 0.023) and 2 mo (2.8 ± 0.7 mg/d vs 3.8 ± 1.1 mg/d, P = 0.033). Tacrolimus 12-h trough concentrations were similar between the two groups at all times except for 2 wk post- transplantation, when the concentrations were significantly greater in group S recipients than in group N recipients (11.3 ± 4.8 ng/mL vs 7.0 ± 3.8 ng/mL, P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: SFS grafts recipients have significantly decreased tacrolimus dosage requirements compared with non-SFS grafts recipients in AALDLT during the first 2 mo post-surgery. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

70449730494	Indicators of prognosis after liver transplantation in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma patients	AIM: To identify prognostic factors of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who were treated by orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: From January 2000 to October 2006, 165 patients with HCC underwent OLT. Various clinicopathological risk factors for actuarial and recurrence-free survival were identified using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independently predictive factors for actuarial and recurrence-free survival, which were used to propose new selection criteria. We compared the outcome of the subgroup patients meeting different criteria. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 13.0 mo (2.8-69.5 mo). Overall, 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year actuarial survival was 73.3%, 45.6%, 35.4% and 32.1%, respectively. One-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall recurrence-free survival was 67.0%, 44.3%, 34.5% and 34.5%, respectively. In univariate analysis, number of tumors, total tumor size, lobar distribution, differentiation, macrovascular invasion, microvascular invasion, capsulation of the tumor, and lymph node metastasis were found to be associated significantly with actuarial and tumor-free survival. By means of using the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, total tumor size and macrovascular invasion were found to be independent predictors of actuarial and tumor-free survival. When the selection criteria were expanded into the proposed criteria, there was no significant difference in 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year actuarial and tumor-free survival of the 49 patients who met the proposed criteria (97.6%, 82.8%, 82.8% and 82.8%, and 90.7%, 82.8%, 68.8% and 68.8%, respectively) compared with that of patients who met the Milan or University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria. CONCLUSION: Macrovascular invasion and total tumor diameter are the strongest prognostic factors. The proposed criteria do not adversely affect the outcome of liver transplantation for HCC, compared with the Milan or UCSF criteria. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

0035194238	Significance of kupffer cell NF-kB activation during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion in rats	AIM: To explore the effect of Kupffer cells (KCs) NF-kB activation on liver injury during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion(HIR) in rats. METHODS: Wistar rats were divided randomly into HIR group in which hepatic reperfusion was given after 90 minutes of ischemia by interruption of the arterial and portal venous blood supply to the left lobes and middle lobes of the liver; HIR IL-10/saline treatment group in which recombinant murine IL-10 (10mg/kg) or normal saline were injected via the dorsum vein of penis before ischemia and reperfusion; and sham control group in which midline laparotomy was performed without vascular occlusion and treatment. NF-kB activities of KCs were determined with EMSA. Expression levels of TNFαmRNA, IL-6mRNA and IL-1βmRNA of KCs were measured with RT-PCR. Serum levels of ALT and AST were measured. RESULTS: KCs NF-kB were activated 0-12h after reperfusion and activities of NF-kB were maximal 3h after reperfusion in HIR group. Expression levels of TNFαmRNA, IL-6 mRNA and IL-1βmRNA of KCs were increased markedly from 0 to 12h and peaked 3h after reperfusion in HIR group, and the mRNA expression levels of KCs were significantly higher in HIR group than in sham control group. Serum levels of ALT and AST were increased significantly after reperfusion in HIR group rats compared with sham control group; KCs NF-kB activities were significantly lower in HIR IL-10 treatment group than in HIR group from 0 to 12h after reperfusion. Expression levels of TNFαmRNA, IL-6 mRNA and IL-1βmRNA of KCs were lowered markedly in HIR IL-10 treatment group as compared with HIR group from 0 to 12h after reperfusion. Serum levels of ALT and AST were decreased significantly after reperfusion in HIR IL-10 treatment group as compared with HIR group. CONCLUSIONS: NF-kB activation of KCs after HIR induces hepatic injury by promoting expressions of TNFαmRNA, IL-6mRNA and IL-1βmRNA of KCs. IL-10 protects against hepatic injury by suppressing excessive NF-kB activation of KCs and the subsequent mRNA expressions of proinflammatory mediators of KCs during HIR.

71749105706	Body Mass Index Evaluating Donor Hepatic Steatosis in Living Donor Liver Transplantation	Introduction: Evaluation of graft hepatic steatosis is important for the safety of the donor and the recipient in living donor liver transplantation. It is necessary to establish a noninvasive evaluation method to avoid performing a liver biopsy for donor safety. The aim of this study was to identify independent factors that correlated with hepatic steatosis to create a noninvasive method to evaluate hepatic steatosis. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 105 living donors. No prisoners were used to obtain the grafts, all of which underwent postoperative histological evaluation for hepatic steatosis. Preoperative clinical and biochemical variables were examined with univariate analyses, and filtered variables further examined with ordinal regression analysis. Results: Eighty (76.2%) donors showed no hepatic steatosis, 15 (14.3%), mild steatosis, and 10 (9.5%), moderate steatosis. In ordinal stepwise regression analysis, body mass index (BMI; P = .000) was the only independent factor that correlated with the grade of hepatic steatosis. Preoperative biochemical parameters were not significantly correlated with hepatic steatosis. A regression model based on BMI was created to evaluate hepatic steatosis grade. Furthermore, individuals with a BMI > 27.5 were most likely to show moderate steatosis, and those with BMI < 23 likely to display no or mild steatosis. Conclusion: BMI can help to identify the grade of hepatic steatosis among living donors. BMI is also useful to select living donors for a preoperative liver biopsy before liver transplantation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

73949154916	Management of venous stenosis in living donor liver transplant recipients	AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the management and outcome of venous obstruction after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHODS: From February 1999 to May 2009, 1 intraoperative hepatic vein (HV) tension induced HV obstruction and 5 postoperative HV anastomotic stenosis occurred in 6 adult male LDLT recipients. Postoperative portal vein (PV) anastomotic stenosis occurred in 1 pediatric left lobe LDLT. Patients ranged in age from 9 to 56 years (median, 44 years). An air balloon was used to correct the intraoperative HV tension. Emergent surgical reoperation, transjugular HV balloon dilatation with stent placement and transfemoral venous HV balloon dilatation was performed for HV stenosis on days 3, 15, 50, 55, and 270 after LDLT, respectively. Balloon dilatation followed with stent placement via superior mesenteric vein was performed for the pediatric PV stenosis 168 d after LDLT. RESULTS: The intraoperative HV tension was corrected with an air balloon. The recipient who underwent emergent reoperation for hepatic stenosis died of hemorrhagic shock and renal failure 2 d later. HV balloon dilatation via the transjugular and transfemoral venous approach was technically successful in all patients. The patient with early-onset HV stenosis receiving transjugular balloon dilatation and stent placement on the 15th postoperative day left hospital 1 wk later and disappeared, while the patient receiving the same interventional procedures on the 50th postoperative day died of graft failure and renal failure 2 wk later. Two patients with late-onset HV stenosis receiving balloon dilatation have survived for 8 and 4 mo without recurrent stenosis and ascites, respectively. Balloon dilatation and stent placement via the superior mesenteric venous approach was technically successful in the pediatric left lobe LDLT, and this patient has survived for 9 mo without recurrent PV stenosis and ascites. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative balloon placement, emergent reoperation, proper interventional balloon dilatation and stent placement can be effective as a way to manage hepatic and PV stenosis during and after LDLT. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

77749323291	Prevention and treatment of rethrombosis after liver transplantation with an implantable pump of the portal vein	Implantable pumps have been used to prevent deep vein thrombosis and other diseases. In this article, we report for the first time the prevention and treatment of rethrombosis of the portal vein in liver transplantation with an implantable pump of the portal vein. Four hundred four orthotopic liver transplantation cases were retrospectively reviewed and divided into 3 groups: portal vein thrombosis (PVT) patients with an implantable pump (n = 28), PVT patients without an implantable pump (n = 20), and patients without preexisting PVT (n = 356). The following parameters for the 3 groups of patients were calculated and compared: (1) preoperative parameters, including baseline data of the donors and recipients and times of graft ischemia; (2) intraoperative and postoperative parameters, including surgery time, red blood cell and plasma transfusion, platelet concentrate transfusion, bleeding and primary graft malfunction, and duration of the hospital and intensive care unit stays; and (3) follow-up information for the patency of the portal vein, rethrombosis rate, stenosis and reoperation (relaparotomy or retransplantation), in-hospital mortality, and actuarial 1-year survival rate. Among the 3 groups of recipients, no significant differences were detected in preoperative and intraoperative parameters. However, compared to PVT patients without an implantable pump, PVT patients with an implantable pump showed remarkable reductions in their postoperative hospital stay, rethrombosis, reoperation rate, and in-hospital mortality. An implantable pump of the portal vein in liver transplantation patients can prevent and facilitate the treatment of portal vein rethrombosis and is associated with a reduction of in-hospital mortality. © 2010 AASLD.

77952672271	Genetic variants in the BDNF gene and therapeutic response to risperidone in schizophrenia patients: A pharmacogenetic study	Risperidone is a widely used atypical antipsychotic agent that produces considerable interindividual differences in patient response. We investigated the pharmacogenetic relationship between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and response to risperidone in 127 Han Chinese schizophrenic patients. Three functional polymorphisms, (GT) n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism, C-270T, and the rs6265G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), were genotyped and analyzed for association, with reduction of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores following an 8-week period of risperidone monotherapy. For individual polymorphic analysis, we found that the frequency of the 230-bp allele of the (GT) n polymorphism was much higher in responders (47.95%) than in nonresponders (32.41%) and the difference was statistically significant even after Bonferroni's adjustment (for the 230-bp allele: adjusted P=0.039). For haplotype-based analyses of the three polymorphisms, no positive finding was observed in the global test, but in specific haplotype tests, two haplotypes were also significantly related to response to risperidone (for haplotype 230-bp/C-270/rs6265G: P=0.0009; for haplotype 234-bp/C-270/rs6265A: P=0.043), indicating that patients with the 230-bp allele of the (GT) n polymorphism or the 230-bp/C-270/rs6265G haplotype responded better to risperidone than those with other alleles or haplotypes, and that the positive effect of the individual haplotype 230-bp/C-270/rs6265G was mainly driven by the 230-bp allele. These findings demonstrate that the individual and combinatorial genetic variants in the BDNF gene might have a role in the therapeutic response to risperidone in the Han Chinese population. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

77953503059	Microsurgical reconstruction of hepatic artery in A-A LDLT: 124 consecutive cases without HAT	Aim: To retrospectively investigate microsurgical hepatic artery (HA) reconstruction and management of hepatic thrombosis in adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (A-A LDLT). Methods: From January 2001 to September 2009, 182 recipients with end-stage liver disease underwent A-A LDLT. Ten of these patients received dual grafts. The 157 men and 25 women had an age range of 18 to 68 years (mean age, 42 years). Microsurgical techniques and running sutures with back-wall first techniques were performed in all arterial reconstructions under surgical loupes (3.5 ×) by a group of vascular surgeons. Intimal dissections were resolved by interposition of the great saphenous vein (GSV) between the donor right hepatic artery (RHA) and recipient common HA (3 cases) or abdominal aorta (AA) (2 cases), by interposition of cryopreserved iliac vessels between the donor RHA and recipient AA (2 cases). Results: In the 58 incipient patients in this series, hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT) was encountered in 4 patients, and was not observed in 124 consecutive cases (total 192 grafts, major incidence, 2.08%). All cases of HAT were suspected by routine color Doppler ultrasonographic examination and confirmed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and hepatic angiography. Of these cases of HAT, two occurred on the 1st and 7th d, respectively, following A-A LDLT, and were immediately revascularized with GSV between the graft and recipient AA. HAT in one patient occurred on the 46th postoperative day with no symptoms, and the remaining case of HAT occurred on the 3rd d following A-A LDLT, and was cured by thrombolytic therapy combined with an anticoagulant but died of multiorgan failure on the 36th d after A-A LDLT. No deaths were related to HAT. Conclusion: Applying microsurgical techniques and selecting an appropriate anastomotic artery for HA reconstruction are crucial in reducing the high risk of HAT during A-A LDLT. © 2010 Baishideng.

77955599623	Outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma treated by liver transplantation: Comparison of living donor and deceased donor transplantation	BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) has been widely accepted as the treatment of choice for end-stage liver diseases. Due to the scarcity of cadaveric donors, adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is advocated as a practical alternative to deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). However, some reports suggest that the long-term and recurrence-free survival rates of LDLT are poorer than those of DDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to compare the long-term and recurrence-free survival rates of HCC between LDLT and DDLT. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 150 patients with HCC from January 2005 to March 2009. Eleven patients who died of complications during the perioperative period were excluded. The remaining 139 eligible patients (101 DDLT and 38 LDLT) were regularly followed up to October 2009. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare the characteristics of LDLT and DDLT. The long-term and recurrence-free survival curves of both groups were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method with comparisons performed using the log-rank test. One-way analysis of variance was performed to compare the waiting time of the two groups. RESULTS: Survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for LDLT were 81%, 62%, 53%, and 45% and for DDLT were 86%, 60%, 50%, and 38%, respectively. The overall 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year recurrence-free rates for LDLT were 71%, 49%, 42%, and 38%, and for DDLT were 76%, 52%, 41%, and 37%, respectively. No significant differences were found by the logrank test on both long-term and recurrence-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: The role of LDLT is reinforced by our study. It may expand the donor pool and achieve the same long-term and recurrence-free survival rates of DDLT. © 2010, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

77954897950	Prophylaxis Against hepatitis B recurrence posttransplantation using lamivudine and individualized low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin	Although the combination of lamivudine (LAM) and high-dose intravenous (IV) hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) is very effective in preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT), the major limitation of this regimen is its high cost. A more cost-effective, convenient and widely accepted regimen is urgently needed. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of another strategy using LAM and individualized low-dose intramuscular (IM) HBIG. Between May 2002 and December 2009, a total of 254 adult patients undergoing LT for HBV-related benign end-stage liver diseases received this regimen in our center. The mean follow-up of these patients was 41.2 ± 22.7 months. Their 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 85.3%, 77.4% and 76.4%, respectively, and 1-, 3- and 5-year HBV recurrence rates were 2.3%, 6.2% and 8.2%. Fourteen patients experienced posttransplant HBV recurrence. Pretransplant high viral load and posttransplant prednisone withdrawal time were observed to be associated with recurrence. In conclusion, combination therapy with LAM and individualized low-dose IM HBIG provides a safe and effective prophylaxis against HBV recurrence after LT at about 5% of the cost of conventional high-dose IV HBIG regimens. © 2010 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.

77955057308	Pharacogenetic effects of dopamine transporter gene polymorphisms on response to chlorpromazine and clozapine and on extrapyramidal syndrome in schizophrenia	A number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) Gene as an antipsychotic target. However, the focus has mainly been on a 40-bp variable number of a tandem repeat (VNTR) in the 3'-region and results have been inconsistent. To fully evaluate SLC6A3 as a therapeutic antipshycotic target we investigated association of the gene with responses to chlorpromazine and clozapine and with chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) in the Chinese schizophrenia population. Six polymorphisms across the whole region of this gene were analyzed, namely rs2652511 (T-844C) and rs2975226 (T-71A) in the 5'-regulatory region, rs2963238 (A1491C) in intron 1, a 30-bp VNTR in intron 8, rs27072 and the 40-bp VNTR in the 3'-region. We found that the polymorphic marker, rs2975226, showed significant association of allele and genotype frequencies with response to clozapine (allele-wise: adjusted p= 0.00404; genotype-wise: adjusted p= 0.024), and that patients with the T allele had a better response to the drug. The haplotype block constructed from the first three markers near the 5'-region showed significant association with response to clozapine (for haplotype T-T-A: p= 0.0085; for haplotype C-A-C: p= 0.0092). We did not identify any significant association of the six genetic variants or haplotypes with EPS after Bonferoni correction. Our findings suggest that the 5'-regulatory region of SLC6A3 plays an important role in response to clozapine and that its role in EPS needs to be replicated in a large-scale well designed study. © 2010.

77955478354	Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation: Recurrence characteristics and risk factors	Background/Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate tumor recurrence characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT), including recurrence sites, time and risk factors, and to provide a basis for predicting and preventing tumor recurrence. Methodology: Data from 224 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent LT between Feb 1999 and December 2008 at our center had been retrospectively analyzed. Tumor-unrelated, perioperative and in hospital deaths were excluded (n=39). All the cases were followed-up regularly. According to recurrence or not, the cases were divided into recurrence group (n=103) and non-recurrence group (n=99). The data were analyzed statistically. Results: Extrahepatic and single site recurrences were more common in early postoperative days, especially in the lung. No significant relation was observed between recurrence sites and time. Exceeding Milan criteria (MC), macrovascular invasion, liver capsule invasion, satellite lesions and Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) classification of UICC were observed significant different in univariate analysis. TNM classification and macrovascular invasion were considered 2 independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. Macrovascular invasion was a independent risk factor for very early recurrences (6 months). Conclusions: Recurrence of HCC after LT was not frequent at intrahepatic but extrahepatic sites. The recurrence time was mainly in early operative days. TNM classification and macrovascular invasion are risk factors. Macrovascular invasion is associated with early recurrence. © H.G.E.

77956454889	Quality of life and psychologic distress of recipients after adult living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT)-a study from mainland china	This cross-sectional study investigated potential factors impacting quality of life in 125 recipients after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured by using the Chinese version of Medical Outcomes Study Short Form36 (SF-36), and psychologic symptoms by using the Symptom Checklist90Revised (SCL-90-R). Clinical and demographic data were collected from the records of the Chinese Liver Transplant Registry and via questionnaire. A total of 102 recipients (81.6%) completed the questionnaires. All SF-36 domain scores (except the mental health score) were lower in the study than in the general population of Sichuan. The mental quality of life was significantly lower in female than in male subjects (P = .000). Regarding the role-physical (P = .016), social functioning (P = .000), and role-emotional (P = .004) domains, recipients >1 year after transplantation scored higher than those <1 year. Bodily pain scores were lower in recipients with prior acute liver failure than those with hepatic carcinoma or hepatic cirrhosis (P = .032). Social functioning was poorer in recipients with than in those without complications (P = .039). Mental component summary scale (MCS) scores and some of physical component summary scale (PCS) significantly correlated with symptom dimension scores of the SCL-90-R (P < .05). In conclusion, gender, time since transplant, etiology of disease, complications, occupation, and some psychologic symptoms were possible factors influencing postoperative HRQoL of LDLT recipients. © 2010 by Elsevier Inc.

77957365812	Testing for genetic association between the ZDHHC8 gene locus and susceptibility to schizophrenia: An integrated analysis of multiple datasets	A number of studies have reported an association between the ZDHHC8 gene locus and schizophrenia but have produced some divergent findings and their interpretation is not straightforward. We investigated the association of the ZDHHC8 gene locus with schizophrenia using meta-analytic techniques, combining all published data up to May 2009 and focusing on 10 independent studies from six published references covering 2,894 cases, 2,932 controls and 1,225 parent-offspring trios. We restricted the analysis to studies investigating rs175174, the most frequently studied single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Stratified meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether ancestry, study design, or gender moderated any association. Analyses of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype structure of this gene locus were also performed based on the hapmap project genotype data to determine whether there were other independent polymorphic markers which might contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia in particular ethnic populations. We found no allelic- or genotype-wise evidence for an association of the rs175174 SNP with schizophrenia in our overall analysis. After applying stratified analyses, there was only a weak nominal genotype-wise association of this SNP with schizophrenia in the dominant genetic model in East Asian populations (P=0.049), which might be caused by significant between-study heterogeneity (P=0.042). No significant publication bias was detected. Other polymorphic markers within this gene genotyped in the hapmap project across different ethnic populations were in strong LD with rs175174. Consistently negative associations were found in the rs175174 polymorphism. LD structure further suggested that the ZDHHC8 locus might not play an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77958496161	A1166C genetic variation of the angiotensin II type I receptor gene and susceptibility to coronary heart disease: Collaborative of 53 studies with 20,435 cases and 23,674 controls	Objective: Angiotensin II induces vasoconstriction and vascular smooth muscle growth via stimulation of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AGTR1). Some studies have reported an association between a genetic variant (A1166C) in the 3' un-translated region of AGTR1 and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but other have yielded apparently conflicting results. Methods: Literature-based meta-analyses were performed on 48 papers including 53 studies published before June 2008 in relation to the A1166C polymorphism (NCBI, dbSNP: rs5186) of the AGTR1, involving a total of 20,435 CHD cases and 23,674 controls. We also explored potential sources of heterogeneity and conducted appropriate stratified analyses. Results: In a combined analysis, the per-allele odds ratio (OR) for CHD of the A1166C polymorphism was 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.19), but there is an indication of publication bias and heterogeneity among the 53 studies. Sample size and study quality were significant sources of heterogeneity among studies of the A1166C polymorphism with possibly overestimates in studies of smaller sample-size and poor-quality. When the analyses were restricted to 11 larger studies (≥500 cases), and to 8 high-quality studies (quality score: ≥11 points), the summary per-allele odds ratios were 0.992 (95% confidence interval, 0.944-1.042) and 0.990 (95% confidence interval, 0.915-1.072), respectively. Conclusions: An overall weak association between the A1166C polymorphism and CHD is observed but this is likely to be due to publication bias and heterogeneity between studies. There were no significant associations among the larger sample-size and high-quality studies which are less prone to selective publication and have greater power to detect a true association. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

78649480347	Does model for end-stage liver disease score predict the short-term outcome of living donor liver transplantation?	Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for short-term outcomes after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Patients and Methods The 135 consecutive patients who underwent LDLT did not include prisoners or their organs. Patients were divided into a low (group A; MELD score <15), a moderate (group B; MELD score <15 but <25), and a high MELD score (group C; MELD score ≥25) group according to their preoperative score. We retrospectively analyzed the data concerning complications, biochemical parameters, and survival over 90 postoperative days. Results Complications were similar among patients with a low, moderate, or high MELD score. The 90-day survival rates of group A, B, and C were 88%, 90%, and 90%, respectively (P = .960). Compared with groups A and B, group C showed a longer mean intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Conclusion Preoperative MELD score may not help to predict short-term outcomes of LDLT. However, a high MELD score may be related to a prolonged ICU stay. © 2010 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

78650433578	Dual grafts live donor liver transplantation for acute-on-chronic hepatitis b liver failure	Objective This study reports the preliminary experience of dual grafts living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF) caused by hepatitis B. Methods Two patients who demonstrated acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure and portal hypertension with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores of 42 and 37, respectively, underwent dual LDLT grafts including one right lobe without a middle hepatic vein and one left lobe because the graft-to-recipient body weight ratio of the right lobe grafts were 0.53% and 0.66%. The donors and the recipients have been followed for over 1 year. Results Mortality and operative complications were not observed in the donors or recipients. At present, the donors and recipients have returned to their daily routine. No prisoners or organs from prisoners were used to obtain these data. Conclusion Dual LDLT grafts including one right lobe without the middle hepatic vein and one left lobe may be a possible therapeutic option for subjects with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B-induced liver failure. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78650617706	Transdiaphragmatic exposure for direct atrioatrial anastomosis in liver transplantation	Background Liver transplantation in Budd-Chiari syndrome remains controversial; however, some improved techniques lead to better results. We report medium-term follow-up results of liver transplantation with atrioatrial anastomosis for Budd-Chiari syndrome and explore the indications of liver transplantation with atrioatrial anastomosis for patients with end stage liver disease. Methods Nine patients (six Budd-Chiari syndromes, one end stage hepatolithiasis, one hepatocellular carcinoma and one incurable alveolar echinococcosis) underwent liver transplantation with atrioatrial anastomosis in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from 1999 to 2006. Eight liver transplants used cadaveric orthotopic livers and one a living donor liver. The operative technique was transdiaphragmatic exposure for direct atrioatrial anastomosis and replacement of inferior vena cava by cryopreserved vena cava graft with the help of venovenous bypass. Results All liver transplantations were successful. Two patients contracted pulmonary infection and acute rejection took place in another case. With proper treatment, all patients recovered well and had good quality of life. To date, they have been followed up for more than 24 months. The only death followed recurrence of hepatic carcinoma three years after liver transplantation. Conclusions Transdiaphragmatic exposure for direct atrioatrial anastomosis and the cryopreserved vena cava graft replacement of inferior vena cava are possible for patients with end stage liver disease thus extending the indications of liver transplantation.

79251584971	Donor right hepatectomy in living donor liver transplantation: Report of 143 cases	Background/Aims: To summarize the surgical techniques of liver resection for right hepatic lobe graft in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methodology: Data of 143 living donors of right hepatic lobe graft from January 2002 to February 2009 were retrospectively studied. The right lobe grafts were obtained by transecting the liver on the right side of the middle hepatic vein. Liver transection was done by using an ultrasonic dissector without inflow vascular occlusion. The standard liver volume (SLV) and the ratio of right lobe volume to SLV were calculated. Results: The weight of right hepatic lobe graft ranged from 310 g to 870 g, accounting for 39.7-69.5% of SLV with the ratio of residual left liver from 30.5% to 60.3%, corresponding to 31.7%-71.6% of the recipient SLV. The mean operative loss of blood was 428 ml. Complications included 2 cases of intraabdominal bleeding, 1 thrombosis of the portal vein, 1 liver function insufficiency, 3 bile leakages, 1 chyle leakage, 2 pleural effusions and 5 wound steatoses. At last, all donors restored to health. Conclusions: Estimation of the liver volume by CT or formulae and accurate donor hepatectomy is of clinical importance in planning and performing successful living donor liver transplantation. © H.G.E.

79958026388	XRCC1 genetic polymorphism Arg399Gln and hepatocellular carcinoma risk: A meta-analysis	Studies investigating the association between X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) genetic polymorphism Arg399Gln and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk report conflicting results. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship. Methods: Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, CNKI and Chinese Biomedicine Database. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for XRCC1 polymorphism and HCC were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. The pooled ORs were performed for a codominant model (Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln vs. Arg/Arg), a dominant model (Gln/Gln+Arg/Gln vs. Arg/Arg) and a recessive model (Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Gln+Arg/Arg). Results: This meta-analysis included 11 case-control studies, which included 2208 HCC cases and 3265 controls. Overall, the variant genotypes (Gln/Gln and Arg/Gln) of Arg399Gln were not associated with HCC risk when compared with the wild-type Arg/Arg homozygote (Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.79-1.28; Arg/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, OR=1.09, 95% CI=0.81-1.45). Similarly, no associations were found in the dominant and recessive models (dominant model, OR=1.12, 95% CI=0.85-1.47; recessive model, OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.79-1.25). Limiting the analysis to the studies within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the results were persistent and robust. When stratifying for ethnicity, country/region and source of controls, no evidence of a significant association was observed in any subgroup. No publication bias was found in the present study. Conclusion: No association is found between the XRCC1 polymorphism Arg399Gln and the risk of HCC. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

79957577533	Alternatives to albumin administration in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing hepatectomy: An open, randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety	Background The value of artificial colloids in treating patients with liver disease is controversial. The effects of intravascular volume replacement regimens on liver function secondary to alteration of the postoperative inflammatory response are not known. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different volume replacement regimens in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing hepatectomy to clarify whether albumin administration can be replaced by other volume replacement products. Methods Ninety consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients scheduled for hepatectomy were prospectively randomized to receive 20% human albumin (HA), 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or lactated Ringer's solution (LR) for postoperative volume replacement. Hemodynamic, liver function and inflammatory response parameters were recorded on postoperative days one, three, and five throughout the investigation period. Results Significantly less volume was required in the HA and the HES groups. Although patients in all groups had similar baseline values, the plasma osmolality was significantly higher in the HA and HES groups. Total bilirubin (TB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased from baseline in all groups, and did not differ significantly between groups. C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly lower in the HES group compared with the other groups. Conclusions In hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing hepatectomy, HA can be replaced by HES or LR in well selected patients. Hemodynamic stability, liver function, and postoperative clinical outcomes could be equivalently achieved in the HES group; also, HES may exert more favorable effects on the acute phase response.

79959303619	Predictors of patient survival following living donor liver transplantation	Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is considered to be the alterative choice in light of the great shortage of cadaveric donors. However, the characteristics of the patients who will beneft from LDLT have not been well identifed. The aim of this study was to defne the pre- and intra-operative factors that may infuence patient outcome. METHODS: The data from 102 LDLT patients who had operations between 2002 and 2009 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Data were analyzed using uni- and multi-variate analysis according to factors that are known to be associated with outcome in these patients. RESULTS: Overall, the accurate survival rate of recipients at 1, 3, and 5 years was 84%, 76%, and 70%, respectively. The independent risk factors, preoperative renal dysfunction, intraoperative red blood cell transfusions of greater than 5 units, and female to male match (donor to recipient matching), were identifed by Cox regression analysis. The pre-transplant model for end-stage liver disease score and a graft to recipient weight ratio of less than 0.8% were not predictive of outcome. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of patients with one or no risk factors and two or more risk factors were 91%, 86%, and 83% and 67%, 56%, and 47%, respectively (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In our retrospective study, preoperative renal dysfunction, intraoperative red blood cell transfusions of greater than 5 units, and female to male gender match were independent risk factors for LDLT recipient outcome. Two or more of these risk factors may contribute to poor outcome. © 2011, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

79959425747	New prognostic model for adult-to-adult living donor liver transplant recipients	Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (A-A LDLT) is an effective therapeutic modality to treat patients with end-stage liver disease. The aims of this study were to identify recipient characteristics of A-A LDLT seeking to determine variables that affected patient survival. We retrospectively examined a cohort of 154 consecutive A-A LDLT recipients with end-stage liver disease in our center over 4 years. All donors volunteered to give their partial livers with written consent. There were no organs from prisoners and no prisoner subjects. The overall survivals at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 93.5%, 90.9%, 88.9%, 86.3%, 80%, 65.6%, 63.8%, and 63.8%, respectively. About 31 pre- and intraoperative factors were analyzed to identify correlations with posttransplant survival using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model. Recipient age, serum creatinine concentration, intraoperative blood loss, and graft-to-recipient weight ratio were significant predictors of survival after transplantation. The prognostic index model, which was calculated by combining these four prognostic values with their regression coefficients, showed a c-statistic of 0.706 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6210.792) compared with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease value of 0.546 (95% CI = 0.3500.558). There was a significant difference between the predictions achieved with the two models (P = .012). In conclusion, selecting younger recipients, better pretransplant renal condition, reduced intraoperative blood loss, and graft-to-recipient size match appeared to be advantageous to achieve better survivals among patients undergoing A-A LDLT. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79959702329	p73 G4C14-A4T14 polymorphism and cancer risk: A meta-analysis based on 27 case-control studies	p73 G4C14-A4T14 polymorphism has been hypothesised to be associated with the risk of cancer development by many epidemiological studies, however, the available results were conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of association between the p73 G4C14-A4T14 polymorphism and risk of cancer, we performed a meta-analysis based on 8017 cancer cases and 11610 controls from 25 publications with 27 individual case-control studies. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Overall, We found that the variant AT/AT homozygote was associated with a significantly increased risk of all types of cancer (homozygote comparison: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.11-1.65; recessive model comparison: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.11-1.58). In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity/country, the results suggested that AT/AT genotype was significantly associated with risk of cancer development among Caucasians and Asians, especially for the Americans and Japanese. Moreover, when stratifying by types of cancer, significantly increased cancer risks were observed for colorectal cancer, 'head and neck cancers' and 'other cancers'. Interestingly, when stratifying by source of controls, a significantly elevated risk was found among hospital-based studies but not among population-based studies. Limiting the analysis to the studies within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the results were persistent and robust. No publication bias was found in the present study. This meta-analysis suggests that the p73 -AT allele may be a low-penetrant risk factor for cancer development. © The Author 2011.

79960943280	Polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and hepatocellular carcinoma risk: A HuGE systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: Studies investigating the associations between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA) polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk report conflicting results. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between TNFA gene TNFA-308(G/A), TNFA-238(G/A), TNFA-863(C/A), TNFA-857(C/T), TNFA-1031 (T/C) polymorphisms and HCC susceptibility. Methods: Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Database. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for TNFA polymorphisms and HCC were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. Results: This meta-analysis included 17 case-control studies, which included 2,357 HCC cases and 3,161 controls. Overall, the variant genotypes AA/AG of -308G/A were associated with a significantly increased HCC risk, when compared with GG genotype (AA vs. GG, OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.01-3.83; AG vs. GG, OR = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.23-2.88; AA/AG vs. GG, OR = 1.80, 95%CI = 1.19-2.72). When stratifying for ethnicity, significantly elevated HCC risk was found among Asians. Moreover, similar results were observed between TNFA-238G/A, TNFA-863C/A polymorphisms and HCC risk among Asians (for -238G/A, AG vs. GG OR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.17-2.26, AA/AG vs. GG OR = 1.61, 95%CI = 1.16-2.24; for -863 C/A, AC vs. CC OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.03-2.88, AA/AC vs. CC OR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.02-2.86), while no associations were observed between TNFA-857C/T, TNFA-1031T/C polymorphisms and HCC susceptibility. Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that TNFA-308G/A, TNFA-238G/A and TNFA-863C/A polymorphisms may be associated with HCC among Asians. TNFA-857C/T and TNFA-1031T/C polymorphisms were not detected to be related to the risk for HCC. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

80053332887	IFN-γ+874 A/T polymorphism and cancer risk: An updated analysis based on 32 case-control studies	IFN-γ is a T-helper 1 cytokine and plays important roles in modulating almost all the immune responses, such as hematopoiesis, T-cell differentiation, antiproliferative, antiviral, and antitumor activities. A single nucleotide polymorphism (+874A/T) which is located in the first intron of the human IFN-γ gene can putatively influence the secretion of IFN-γ. Results from previous studies on the association of +874A/T polymorphism with different cancer types remained contradictory. In order to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Database. Thirty two studies including 4524 cases and 5684 controls were collected for IFN-γ+874 A/T polymorphism. Summary odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for IFN-γ polymorphism and cancer were estimated using fixed- and random-effects models when appropriate. Overall, no evidence indicated that individuals carrying TT or AT genotypes had significantly increased cancer risk when compared with AA genotype carriers. However, stratified analysis by cancer types indicated a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (TT vs AA: OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.10-2.27, P

80054841311	Interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility: A meta-analysis	AIM: To assess the association between Interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene IL-10-1082 (G/A), IL-10-592(C/A), IL-10-819 (T/C) polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility. METHODS: Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedicine Database. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for IL-10 polymorphisms and HCC were calculated in a fi xed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included seven eligible studies, which included 1012 HCC cases and 2308 controls. Overall, IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism was not associated with the risk of HCC (AA vs AG + GG, OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.90-1.37). When stratifying for ethnicity, the results were similar (Asian, OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.87-1.44; non-Asian, OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.75-1.60). In the overall analysis, the IL-10 polymorphism at position -592 (C/A) was identifi ed as a genetic risk factor for HCC among Asians; patients carrying the IL-10-592*C allele had an increased risk of HCC (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.12-1.49). No association was observed between the IL-10-819 T/C polymorphism and HCC susceptibility (TT vs TC + CC, OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.79-1.32). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that IL-10-592 A/C polymorphism may be associated with HCC among Asians. IL-10-1082 G/A and IL-10-819 T/C polymorphisms were not detected to be related to the risk for HCC. © 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

80455174480	Outcomes of patients with benign liver diseases undergoing living donor versus deceased donor liver transplantation	Background/Aims: The number of people undergoing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has increased rapidly in many transplant centres. Patients considering LDLT need to know whether LDLT is riskier than deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing LDLT versus DDLT. Methods: A total of 349 patients with benign liver diseases were recruited from 2005 to 2011 for this study. LDLT was performed in 128 patients, and DDLT was performed in 221 patients. Pre- and intra-operative variables for the two groups were compared. Statistically analysed post-operative outcomes include the postoperative incidence of complication, biliary and vascular complication, hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence, long-term survival rate and outcomes of emergency transplantation. Results: The waiting times were 22.10±15.31 days for the patients undergoing LDLT versus 35.81±29.18 days for the patients undergoing DDLT. The cold ischemia time (CIT) was 119.34±19.75 minutes for the LDLT group and 346±154.18 for DDLT group. LDLT group had higher intraoperative blood loss, but red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was not different. Similar ≥ Clavien III complications, vascular complications, hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and long-term survival rates were noted. LDLT patients suffered a higher incidence of biliary complications in the early postoperative days. However, during the long-term follow-up period, biliary complication rates were similar between the two groups. The long-term survival rate of patients undergoing emergency transplantation was lower than of patients undergoing elective transplantation. However, no significant difference was observed between emergency LDLT and emergency DDLT. Conclusions: Patients undergoing LDLT achieved similar outcomes to patients undergoing DDLT. Although LDLT patients may suffer a higher incidence of early biliary complications, the total biliary complication rate was similar during the long-term follow-up period. © 2011 Li et al.

83355170474	A single institution experience with living donor liver transplantation for acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure	Background/Aims: This study reports our preliminary experience of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF) caused by hepatitis B. Methodology: 47 patients who demonstrated AoCLF caused by hepatitis B with mean (±SD) Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores of 39.2±5.1 were divided by the transplantation group (n=19) and the non-transplantation group (n=28) according to whether or not undergoing LDLT. At the same time, 30 hepatitis B cirrhosis recipients who underwent LDLT and did not reach the criteria of AoCLF were selected as the control group (n=30). In the transplantation group, veno-venous bypass, molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were introduced. The intraoperative data, post-transplant complications and mortality were analyzed retrospectively. Results: There were no significant differences in survival rates of 1, 6 and 12 months and the postoperative complications except for pneumonia and diabetes, between the control group and the transplantation group (p>0.05). Recurrence of hepatitis B was not found in the recipients of the control group and the transplantation group. Conclusions: Right-lobe LDLT may be an effective therapeutic option for patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

84856762584	Higher tacrolimus blood concentration is related to hyperlipidemia in living donor liver transplantation recipients	Background: The arrival of tacrolimus has drastically improved AALDLT recipients' survival. However, little data of tacrolimus have been reported concerning its effects on lipid metabolism for AALDLT recipients. Aim: Out aim was to investigate the relationship between tacrolimus blood concentration and lipid metabolism in AALDLT recipients. Methods: The pre and postoperative data of 77 adult patients receiving AALDLT between 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The postoperative immune suppressive regimen was prednisone with tacrolimus ± mycophenolate mofetil. Prednisone was withdrawn within the first postoperative month. Blood lipids and tacrolimus concentration were detected at the first, third, and sixth month during follow-up. Episodes of acute rejection were diagnosed based on biopsy. Results: Overall prevalence of post-transplantation hyperlipidemia was 29.9% (23/77) at the sixth postoperative month. The patients were divided into two groups, the hyperlipidemia group and the ortholipidemia group. In the 23 patients with hyperlipidemia, 15 (65%) were hypercholesterolemia, five (22%) were hypertriglyceridemia, and three (13%) patients had both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. In univariate analysis, only tacrolimus blood concentration at the third and sixth post-transplantation months showed significant difference (8.7 ± 2.1 vs. 6.9 ± 3.2, p = 0.013; 9.2 ± 2.7 vs. 7.3 ± 3.8, p = 0.038, respectively). In multivariate logistic analysis, only two factors appear to be risk factors, namely, tacrolimus blood concentration at the third and sixth post-transplantation months (8.7 ± 2.1 vs. 6.9 ± 3.2, p = 0.043; 9.2 ± 2.7 vs. 7.3 ± 3.8 p = 0.035, respectively). Conclusions: Higher tacrolimus blood concentration was related to hyperlipidemia at an early postoperative period. This indicates that tacrolimus blood concentration should be controlled as low as possible in the premise that there is no risk of rejection to minimize post-transplant hyperlipidemia after AALDLT. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84860550431	Causes of mortality after liver transplantation: A single center experience in mainland China	Background/Aims: To analyze the causes of death, both in the short- and long-term after cadaveric liver transplantation (LT) from a single center in mainland China. Methodology: Clinical data of 472 adult patients who underwent primary cadaveric LT from February 1999 to December 2009 at our center were identified. All patients were followed-up until December 2010. Mortalities in three periods were described: the postoperative mortality (within the first 90 postoperative days or more if the patient remained hospitalized); the early mortality (death between 4-12 months after transplantation); the late mortality (death after one year following transplantation). Results: The survival of the 472 patients at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years was 85.2%, 73.5%, 61.2% and 59.7%, respectively. The postoperative mortality, the early mortality and the late mortality were 34.8% (70/201), 27.4% (55/201) and 37.8% (76/201), respectively. Infection, multi-organ failure and technical complications were the major causes of death during the first period, and the recurrence of malignancy was the main cause of death during the early and late periods after LT. Conclusions: Recurrence of malignancy was the major cause of the early and late mortality in our study, which is higher than that of other reports. The serious preoperative condition of the recipient, the waiting timing for the operation and the tumor selection criteria for LT may account for this. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

84861387685	Impact of graft steatosis on the post-transplantation biliary complications for living donor liver transplant recipients in China	Background/Aims: After living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), the prevalence of complications related to the biliary system is 6-35%. In spite of great improvements in both surgical techniques and postoperative and long-term medical treatment, the biliary complications are still considered a relatively high risk for LDLT. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the incidence of biliary complications and identify predisposing risk factors. Methodology: The clinical and follow-up data of 175 adult patients receiving LDLT (right lobe or left lobe) between 2002 and December 2008 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with biliary complications (n=30) and without biliary complications (n=145). Results: Thirty patients (17.1%) had post-transplantation biliary complications. Eight patients (4.6%) were diagnosed with bile leakage, while 24 patients (13.7%) developed biliary stricture. Percentage of steatosis of the graft and hepatic artery thrombosis after LDLT were two factors upon univariate analysis (p=0.034, p=0.01, respectively). In multivariate logistic analysis, 20-50% macrovesicular steatosis emerged as a new defined risk factor by us (p=0.001). There was no difference in patient survival rate in different groups and sorts of graft steatosis (p>0.05). Conclusions: We consider that using a graft with macro-vesicular steatosis in 20-50% should be put on the table carefully, balancing both sides of positive and negative. © H.G.E.

84862020925	Risk factors for in-hospital mortality of patients with high model for end-stage liver disease scores following living donor liver transplantation	Background. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for patients with high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores is controversial due to its poor outcome. However, there is little information regarding which factor would negatively impact the outcome of patients with high MELD scores. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the in-hospital mortality of patients with high MELD scores after LDLT. Material and methods. All patients with an MELD scores ≥ 20 who received LDLT from 2005 to 2011 were recruited for the present study. Pre-and intra-operative variables were retrospectively and statistically analyzed. Results. A total of 61 patients were included in the current study. The overall 3-month survival rate was 82% for patients with high MELD scores. Preoperative renal dysfunction, hyponatremia, starting albumin level < 2.8 g/dL, preoperative renal replacement for severe renal failure, anhepatic period > 100 minutes and intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion ≥ 10 units were identified as potential risk fac tors by univariate analysis. However, only hyponatremia, preoperative dialysis and massive RBC transfusion were independent risk factors in a multivariate analysis. The 3-month survival rates of patients with two or more independent risk factors and patients with none or one risk factor were 91 and 25%, respectively. A significant difference was observed (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Hyponatremia, preoperative dialysis and massi ve RBC transfusion were related to poor outcome for sicker patients. Patients with two or more of the above-mentioned risk factors and high MELD scores may exhibit extremely poor short-term survival.

84862831749	A learning curve for living donor liver transplantation	Background: The number of living donor liver transplantations performed has increased rapidly in many Eastern transplant centres. However, the impact of the transplant centres' experience and learning on the transplant outcomes are not well established. Aim of the study was to evaluate the learning curve for living donor liver transplantation in our centre. Methods: Data from 156 recipients and 156 donors who underwent surgery were reviewed. Intraoperative data and postoperative outcomes of both donors and recipients were retrospectively analysed. Recipients and donors were divided into three groups that consisted of 52 consecutive cases each. Results: Surgical duration and intraoperative blood loss during donor surgery were decreased significantly between the earlier and the more recent cases (423. ±. 39 vs. 400. ±. 44. min and 959. ±. 523 vs. 731. ±. 278. mL, respectively; . P<. 0.01). Rates of postoperative complications and functional changes were not statistically different amongst the three donor groups. Immediate complication rate of the first 52 recipients was higher than those of the second and third cohorts. Long-term survival rates of the three recipient groups were similar. Conclusions: The learning curve greatly influenced immediate outcomes of recipients during the early transplant period. However, it had little influence on donor outcome; long-term outcome improvement of recipients did not depend on the accumulation of experience alone. © 2012 .

84862926453	Unsuccessful treatment of four patients with acute graft-vs-host disease after liver transplantation	AIM: To investigate appropriate therapeutic strategies for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) following liver transplantation. METHODS: Four patients who developed GVHD after liver transplantation in West China Hospital were included in this study. Therapeutic strategies with augmentation or withdrawal of immunosuppressants combined with supportive therapy were investigated in these patients. In addition, a literature review of patients who developed GVHD after liver transplantation was performed. RESULTS: Although a transient response to initial treatment was detected, all four patients died of complications from GVHD: one from sepsis with multiple organ failure, one from gastrointestinal bleeding, and the other two from sepsis with gastrointestinal bleeding. Few consensuses for the treatment of GVHD after liver transplantation have been reached. CONCLUSION: New and effective treatments are re- quired for GVHD after liver transplantation to improve the prognosis of patients with this diagnosis. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84862937986	Quality of life and psychological outcome of donors after living donor liver transplantation	AIM: To investigate the health related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological outcome of donors after living donor liver transplantation. METHODS: Participants were 92 consecutive liver transplant donors who underwent hepatectomy without middle hepatic vein at West China Hospital of Sichuan University between January 2007 and September 2010. HRQoL was measured using the Chinese version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), and psychological symptoms were measured using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Data collected from donors were compared to previously published data from the general population. Clinical and demographic data were collected from medical records and questionnaires. RESULTS: The general health score of the SF-36 was significantly lower in females (59.78 ± 12.25) than in males (75.83 ± 22.09). Donors more than 40 years old scored higher in social functioning (85.71 ± 14.59) and mental health (82.61 ± 20.00) than those younger than 40 (75.00 ± 12.13, 68.89 ± 12.98; social functioning and mental health, respectively). Donors who had surgery more than two years prior to the study scored highest in physical functioning (P = 0.001) and bodily pain (P = 0.042) while those less than one year from surgery scored lowest. The health of the liver recipient significantly influenced the general health (P = 0.042), social functioning (P = 0.010), and role-emotional (P = 0.028) of donors. Donors with full-time employment scored highest in role-physical (P = 0.005), vitality (P = 0.001), social functioning (P = 0.016), mental health (P < 0.001), the physical component summary scale (P < 0.001), and the mental component summary scale (MCS) (P < 0.001). Psychological measures indicated that donors were healthier than the general population in obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation. The MCS of the SF-36 was significantly correlated with most symptom scores of the SCL-90-R. CONCLUSION: HRQoL and psychological outcome were favorable in living liver transplant donors after donation. Specifically, gender, age, time since operation, recipient health condition, and employment after donation, influenced postoperative quality of life. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84862949161	Posttraumatic stress disorder after liver transplantation	BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation can lead to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the risk factors associated with this progression are not well understood. To study this syndrome in adult liver transplant recipients, a cross-sectional investigation of 296 recipients at our hospital was carried out between January and June 2010. METHODS: Study participants completed two questionnaires [a PTSD self-rating scale (PTSD-SS) and a validated Chinese version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36)]. Clinical and demographic data were collected from the records of the Chinese Liver Transplant Registry and via questionnaires. RESULTS: The prevalence of full PTSD and partial PTSD (that met the criteria for 2 of the 3 symptom clusters) was 3.7% and 5.4%, respectively, for all transplant recipients. Significant differences between the recipients with no PTSD, partial PTSD, and full PTSD were found in all SF-36 domains except for physical functioning (P=0.466). In general, domain scores were the highest in the recipients who did not meet the criteria for PTSD and the lowest in the recipients who met the criteria for full PTSD. Greater severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms was correlated with poorer quality of life, especially in the bodily pain (P=0.004), social functioning (P=0.001), role-emotional (P=0.048), and mental health (P<0.001) domains. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, complications, and educational status were identified by multiple regression analysis as risk factors for developing PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD occurred after liver transplantation and was significantly associated with decreased quality of life. Higher MELD scores and complications after transplantation were risk factors that contributed to PTSD, and higher education was a protective factor. © 2012, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

84863275347	Prophylaxis of chronic kidney disease after liver transplantation - experience from west China	AIM: To evaluate the prophylaxis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) after liver transplantation (LT) with low-dose calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). METHODS: From March 1999 to December 2009, a total of 572 patients (478 males and 94 females) underwent LT enrolled in the study. Initial immunosuppression was by triple-drug regimens that included a CNI, MMF, and prednisone. The initial dose of CNI was 0.05-0.10 mg/kg per day for tacrolimus (TAC) and 5-10 mg/kg per d for cyclosporine A (CSA) respectively, and was gradually reduced based on a stable graft function. The serum trough level of CNI was 6-8 ng/mL for TAC and 120-150 ng/mL for CSA 3-mo post-operation, 4-6 ng/mL for TAC and 80-120 ng/mL for CSA 1-year after transplantation was expected with stable liver function. MMF was personalized between 1.0-1.5 g/d. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by an abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Risk factors of CKD were examined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: With a definition of GFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m

84863284960	Graft size alone should not affect donors selection and be used to predict the prognosis of recipients after living donor liver transplantation	Background/Aims: Graft size is recognized as one of the most important factors that affect prognosis of the liver recipients. This study determines whether the graft to recipient weight ratio (GRWR) alone can be used to select the liver donor and as an outcome predictor before living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methodology: LDLT patients (202) were divided into three groups according to the GRWR: Group S (n=46, GRWR <0.8); Group M (n=83, GRWR 0.8-1.0); Group L (n=73, GRWR >1.0). Recovery of graft function, incidence of small-for-size syndrome and rate of complications were compared among the three groups. Results: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics in both the donors and recipients, nor in the intensive care unit stay hours, re-operation rate, hospital stay after operation, Clavien System score and recovery of graft function after transplantation, among the three groups. The small-for-size syndrome rates were 13%, 7.23% and 11% in Groups S, M and B, and no significant difference was noted among the three groups. Conclusions: GRWR may not be the only factor affecting recipient prognosis after LDLT. Local graft dysfunction such as impaired venous outflow, severity of disease and portal hyperperfusion in the recipient, and fatty liver in donor may influence the graft and thus the prognosis of transplantation. © H.G.E.

84863131152	Risk factors and outcomes of massive red blood cell transfusion following living donor liver transplantation	Objectives: To identify the factors influencing blood loss and secondary blood transfusion and to investigate the outcomes of patients who underwent a massive blood transfusion (MBT) following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methods: Patients who underwent primary adult-to-adult right hepatic lobe LDLT were included in the study, and were divided into the MBT group [≥6 red blood cell (RBC) units in 24 h] and the non-massive blood transfusion (NMBT) group (<6 RBC units in 24h). All potential risk factors, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and long-term survival rate of the patients in the two groups were analyzed. Results: The data of 181 eligible patients were retrospectively analyzed. A decreased long-term survival rate, a higher incidence of postoperative infection and prolonged ICU stay were observed in the MBT group. No significant difference was observed in survival rate between patients having platelet transfusion >2 units and ≤2 units. Hemoglobin <100g/L, platelet counts <70×10

84863258846	Interleukin-10-1082G/A polymorphism and acute liver graft rejection: A meta-analysis	AIM: To investigate the association between interleukin (IL)-10-1082 (G/A) promoter polymorphism and acute rejection (AR) in liver transplant (LT) recipients. METHODS: Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedicine Databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism and AR were calculated in a fixed-and a random-effects model as appropriate. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included seven case-control studies, which comprised 652 cases of LT recipients in which 241 cases developed AR and 411 cases did not develop AR. Overall, the variant A allele was not associated with AR risk when compared with the wild-type G allele (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.64-1.39). Moreover, similar results were observed when the AA genotype was compared with the AG/GG genotype (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.55-2.02). When stratifying for ethnicity, no significant association was observed among either Caucasians or Asians. Because only one study was performed in Asian patients, the result of subgroup analysis by ethnicity would not be reliable for Asians. Limiting the analysis to the studies with controls in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the results were persistent and robust. No publication bias was found in the present study. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism may be not associated with AR risk in LT recipients among Caucasians. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84865091206	Reverse engineering biomolecular systems using -omic data: Challenges, progress and opportunities	Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnologies have led to the rapid growing research interest in reverse engineering of biomolecular systems (REBMS). 'Data-driven' approaches, i.e. data mining, can be used to extract patterns from large volumes of biochemical data at molecular-level resolution while 'design-driven' approaches, i.e. systems modeling, can be used to simulate emergent system properties. Consequently, both data- and design-driven approaches applied to -omic data may lead to novel insights in reverse engineering biological systems that could not be expected before using low-throughput platforms. However, there exist several challenges in this fast growing field of reverse engineering biomolecular systems: (i) to integrate heterogeneous biochemical data for data mining, (ii) to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches for systems modeling and (iii) to validate system models experimentally. In addition to reviewing progress made by the community and opportunities encountered in addressing these challenges, we explore the emerging field of synthetic biology, which is an exciting approach to validate and analyze theoretical system models directly through experimental synthesis, i.e. analysis-by-synthesis. The ultimate goal is to address the present and future challenges in reverse engineering biomolecular systems (REBMS) using integrated workflow of data mining, systems modeling and synthetic biology. © The Author 2012.

84865155861	Biliary variations and biliary complications in living donor liver transplantation	Background/Aims: To evaluate the relationship between biliary complications of recipients and biliary variations of donors in living donor liver transplantation. Methodology: From January 2008 to February 2011,60 adult patients underwent LDLT at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. After cholecystectomy, an intraoperative cholangiogram was routinely performed through the cystic duct to identify biliary anatomy. The recipients have been followed up for 3 to 40 months. Results: Biliary complications developed in 9 patients (15.0%) and 3 (5.0%) were diagnosed as anastomotic leakage, while 6 (10.0%) developed strictures. The incidence of biliary variations was 26%. There was no statistical difference in biliary complications no matter the biliary variations. Conclusions: Performing biliary variations assessment may contribute to reduction of biliary complications. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

84865284451	Systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between EPHX1 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk	Background: Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) plays an important role in both the activation and detoxification of PAHs, which are carcinogens found in cooked meat and tobacco smoking. Polymorphisms at exons 3 and 4 of the EPHX1 gene have been reported to be associated with variations in EPHX1 activity. The aim of this study is to quantitatively summarize the relationship between EPHX1 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Methods: Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Databases for studies published before June 2012. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for EPHX1 Tyr113His (rs1051740) and His139Arg (rs2234922) polymorphisms and CRC were calculated in a fixed-effects model and a random-effects model when appropriate. Results: This meta-analysis yielded 14 case-control studies, which included 13 studies for Tyr113His (6395 cases and 7893 controls) and 13 studies for His139Arg polymorphisms (5375 cases and 6962 controls). Overall, the pooled results indicated that EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism was not associated with CRC risk; while the His139Arg polymorphism was significantly associated with decreased CRC risk (Arg/His vs. His/His, OR = 0.90, 95%CI = 0.83-0.98; dominant model, OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.85-0.99). The statistically significant association between EPHX1 His139Arg polymorphism and CRC was observed among Caucasians and population-based case-control studies. This association showed little heterogeneity and remained consistently strong when analyses were limited to studies in which genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or limited to studies with matched controls. When cumulative meta-analyses of the two associations were conducted by studies' publication time, the results were persistent and robust. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism may be not associated with CRC development; while the EPHX1 His139Arg polymorphism may have a potential protective effect on CRC. © 2012 Liu et al.

84866124897	Minimally invasive video-assisted versus conventional open thyroidectomy: A systematic review of available data	Purpose Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT) is now emerging as a novel and less invasive procedure for thyroid diseases. This study conducted a systematic review of the available data to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this new technique over conventional procedure. Methods A systematic literature search was performed on Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing the MIVAT with open thyroidectomy were selected and meta-analyzed. Results Nine RCTs involving 730 patients were included and all were restricted to patients with a thyroid nodule no larger than 4 cm and surgery did not involve lymph node dissection. Both procedures were of similar efficacy in nodule resection. Open surgery had a 1.6 times higher rate of postoperative complications than the novel technique, with no significant difference (P = 0.08), especially in transient recurrent nerve palsy (OR = 0.93, P = 0.87). Although longer operative time was required for MIVAT (MD = 15.0 min, p<0.00001), patients experienced less postoperative pain, especially in the early postoperative period (MD = -11.52, P = 0.0003). There was also a shorter incision length (MD = -2.36 cm, p<0.00001), better cosmetic results and greater patient satisfaction in the novel technique group (WD = 2.59; p<0.00001). Conclusions MIVAT is a feasible, practical, and safe alternative with better cosmetic benefits, and it can be performed with an ease of manipulation that is similar to that of conventional neck surgery. © Springer 2012.

0037439272	Functional changes of dendritic cells derived from allogeneic partial liver graft undergoing acute rejection in rats	Aim: To investigate functional change of dendritic cells (DCs) derived from allogeneic partial liver graft undergoing acute rejection in rats. Methods: Allogeneic (SD rat to LEW rat) whole and 50 % partial liver transplantation were performed. DCs from liver grafts 0 hr and 4 days after transplantation were isolated and propagated in the presence of GM-CSF in vitro. Morphological characteristics of DCs propagated for 4 days and 10 days were observed by electron microscopy. Phenotypical features of DCs propagated for 10 days were analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of IL-12 protein and IL-12 receptor mRNA in DCs propagated for 10 days was also measured by Western blotting and semiquantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Histological grading of rejection were determined. Results: Allogeneic whole liver grafts showed no features of rejection at day 4 after transplantation. In contrast, allogeneic partial liver grafts demonstrated moderate to severe rejection at day 4 after transplantation. DCs derived from allogeneic partial liver graft 4 days after transplantation exhibited typical morphological characteristics of DC after 4 days' culture in the presence of GM-CSF. DCs from allogeneic whole liver graft 0 hr and 4 days after transplantation did not exhibit typical morphological characteristics of DC until after 10 days' culture in the presence of GM-CSF. After 10 days' propagation in vitro, DCs derived from allogeneic whole liver graft exhibited features of immature DC, with absence of CD40, CD80 and CD86 surface expression, and low levels of IL-12 proteins (IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40) and IL-12 receptor (IL-12Rβ

0037713659	NF-κB activation and zinc finger protein A20 expression in mature dendritic cells derived from liver allografts underoing acute rejection	Aim: To investigate the role of NF-κB activation and zinc finger protein A20 expression in the regulation of maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) derived from liver allografts undergoing acute rejection. Methods: Sixty donor male SD rats and sixty recipient male LEW rats weighing 220-300 g were randomly divided into whole liver transplantation group and partial liver transplantation group. Allogeneic (SD rat to LEW rat) whole and 50 % partial liver transplantation were performed. DCs from liver grafts 0 hour and 4 days after transplantation were isolated and propagated in the presence of GM-CSF in vitro. Morphological characteristics and phenotypical features of DCs propagated for 10 days were analyzed by electron microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. NF-κB binding activity, IL-12p70 protein and zinc finger protein A20 expression in these DCs were measured by EMSA and Western blotting, respectively. Histological grading of rejection was determined. Results: Allogeneic whole liver grafts showed no signs of rejection on day 4 after the transplantation. In contrast, allogeneic partial liver grafts demonstrated moderate to severe rejection on day 4 after the transplantation. After propagation for 10 days in the presence of GM-CSF in vitro, DCs from allogeneic whole liver grafts exhibited features of immature DC with absence of CD40 surface expression, these DCs were found to exhibit detectable but very low level of NF-κB activity, IL-12 p70 protein and zinc finger protein A20 expression. Whereas, DCs from allogeneic partial liver graft 4 days after transplantation displayed features of mature DC, with high level of CD40 surface expression, and as a consequence, higher expression of IL-12p70 protein, higher activities of NF-κB and higher expression of zinc finger protein A20 compared with those of DCs from whole liver grafts (P<0.001). Conclusion: These results suggest that A20 expression is up-regulated in response to NF-κB activation in mature DCs derived from allogeneic liver grafts undergoing acute rejection. Given the NF-κB inhibition function of this gene, it is suggested that their expression survives to limit NF-κB activation and maturation of DCs, and consequently inhibits the acute rejection and induces acceptance of liver graft.

84867702720	The effect of postoperative TACE on prognosis of HCC with microscopic venous invasion	Background/Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of postoperative adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with microscopic venous invasion. Methodology: Data from 76 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy with or without postoperative adjuvant TACE between July 2005 and August 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare survival between the groups and prognostic factors were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 76.3%, 44.5% and 31.8%, respectively, for the adjuvant TACE group (35 patients) and 60.1%, 39.3% and 21.5%, respectively, for the control group (41 patients). The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall urvival rates were 88.6%, 67.2% and 42.3%, respectively, for the TACE group and 77.5%, 58.0% and 40.5%, respectively, for the control group. Although improving trends of both disease-free survival and overall survival were observed in adjuvant TACE group, there was no significant difference between the two groups (p>0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that tumor size and differentiation were significant independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: Postoperative adjuvant TACE may improve 1, 3 and 5 year disease-free and overall survival rates of HCC patients with microscopic venous invasion but no statistical significance was found. It can be used as a preventative treatment but not a routine procedure for such patients. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

84868194897	Prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus-related end-stage liver diseases with severe hypersplenism and splenomegaly: Role of splenectomy	Background: The role of splenectomy on prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) for HBV-related end-stage liver diseases with severe hypersplenism and splenomegaly remains unclear today. Methods: A total of 510 consecutive patients with HBV-related end-stage liver diseases who underwent LT in Liver Transplantation Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Chengdu, China) between June 1999 and October 2009 were studied retrospectively in this study. Patients were divided into three groups in this study: splenectomized group (group A, n = 137), including preoperatively splenectomized subgroup (group A1, n = 48) and intraoperatively splenectomized subgroup (group A2, n = 89); nonsplenectomized group with severe hypersplenism (group B, n = 95); and nonsplenectomized group without severe hypersplenism (group C, n = 278). The incidence of posttransplant rejection, posttransplant infection, posttransplant hepatic cell carcinoma recurrence rate, and HBV recurrence rate were recorded. The end of the follow-up period was October 2010. Results: In this study, six patients with HBV recurrence were found in group A, 15 cases in group B, and 13 cases in group C during the follow-up period. (1) The incidence of posttransplant rejection in patients of group A was significantly lower than that in group B (P = 0.0023) and also the HBV recurrence rates in group A markedly decreased (P = 0.004). (2) The incidence of posttransplant rejection in group A was significantly lower than that in group C (P = 0.0433); however, the incidence of posttransplant infection in group A largely increased compared with that in group C (P = 0.0233). The HBV recurrence rates between group A and group C had no significant difference (P = 0.804). (3) The HBV recurrence rates in group B were significantly higher than that in group C (P = 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this study showed that splenectomy could significantly reduce the incidence of posttransplant rejection and HBV recurrence rate for the patients undergoing LT for HBV-related end-stage liver diseases with severe hypersplenism and splenomegaly. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84869072427	Salvage Liver Transplantation for Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma within UCSF Criteria after Liver Resection	Background: Salvage liver transplantation (SLT) is restricted to patients who develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence within Milan criteria (MC). Little is known about outcomes for SLT in patients with recurrent HCC within University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria after liver resection (LR). Methods: Between January 2001 and December 2011, 380 patients with HCC meeting UCSF criteria, 200 of which were resected (LR group) from a perspective of SLT in case of recurrence, and 180 directly underwent LT (PLT). We compared patient characteristics, perioperative and long-term outcomes between SLT and PLT groups. We also assessed the outcome of LR and PLT groups. Results: Among the 200 patients in LR group, 86 (43%) developed HCC recurrence and 15/86 (17%) of these patients presented HCC recurrence outside UCSF criteria. Only 39 of the 86 patients underwent SLT, a transplantation rate of 45% of patients with HCC recurrence. Compared with PLT group, LR group showed lower overall survival rate (P = 0.005) and higher recurrence rate (P = 0.006). Although intraoperative blood loss and required blood transfusion were more frequent in SLT group, the perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were similar in SLT and PLT groups. The overall survival and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between the two groups. When stratifying by graft type in the SLT group, overall survival and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between deceased donor LT (DDLT) and living donor LT (LDLT) groups. In the subgroup analysis by MC, similar results were observed between patients with recurrent HCC meeting MC and patients with recurrent HCC beyond MC but within UCSF criteria. Conclusion: Our single institution experience demonstrated that prior hepatectomy and SLT for recurrent HCC within UCSF criteria was feasible and SLT could achieve the same outcome as PLT. © 2012 Liu et al.

84869093512	Safety of living donor liver transplantation using older donors	Background: There is limited information concerning older donors in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). In the present study, we attempted to clarify whether it is safe to use older donors in LDLT. Methods: A total of 129 cases were reviewed in the present study. Donors and recipients were divided into group A (donors aged ≥50 y, n = 21) and group B (donors aged <50 y, n = 108). The pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables of the two groups were statistically compared. Results: Donors' complication rates were 38.10% and 28.70% for groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.719). The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-y survival rates were 90%, 80%, and 66% for group A and 86%, 83%, and 75% for group B, respectively (P = 0.573). Similar Clavien III or more complication rates for recipients were observed. Conclusions: The present study suggested that LDLT using older donors had no negative influence on the outcomes of both donors and recipients. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

84871338514	Reconstruction of hepatic artery in adult to adult living donor liver transplantation in 104 patients	Objective: To report the experience of hepatic artery reconstruction with adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (ALDLT) using right lobe liver grafts. Methods: From January 2002 to August 2007, 104 patients underwent ALDLT using right lobe grafts. Hepatic arteries of donors and recipients were assessed carefully with spiral CT angiography and DSA before ALDLT. All patients underwent reconstruction of hepatic artery between right lobe liver grafts of donor and recipient which included the anastomosis between right hepatic artery of donors and recipients; the reconstruction of right hepatic artery between donor grafts and left hepatic artery of recipients; interpositional bypass using autogenous saphenous vein and cryopreserved iliac artery between right hepatic artery of donors and hepatic artery, common hepatic artery and abdominal aorta of recipients. The microsurgical technique was employed under the magnification of 3.5 times and operative microscope of 5-10 times. Results: In these series, HAT occurred in 2 recipients at Days 1 and 7 post-ALDLT (1.9%). Both were revascularized with autogenous saphenous vein between right hepatic artery of donor and abdominal aorta of recipient. HAT occurred in 1 recipient at Days 90 post-ALDLT, but no symptom was presented. There was no severe complication and mortality related to hepatic artery reconstruction in recipients. No HAT, hepatic artery stenosis and aneurysm occurred during the follow-up period of 2-60 months. The 1, 2 and 3-year survival rates were 89.3%, 76.0% and 69.3% respectively. Conclusion: Careful evaluation of hepatic artery condition and using microsurgical techniques are important for safer arterial reconstruction and a long-term patency of hepatic artery in living donor liver transplantation in adults using right lobe liver grafts.

84872056092	Using a small-for-size graft might attribute to the future use of left-lobe living graft in adult to adult living donor liver transplantation	Background/Aims: Adult to adult living donor liver transplantation (AALDLT) is performed worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate using a graft with graft to body weight ratio (GBWR) less than 0.8 in right-lobe AALDLT recipients. Methodology: Clinical data of 127 patients who had right-lobe AALDLT from January 2002 to November 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to GBWR (group A: 0.6 ≤GBWR <0.8, group B: GBWR 20.8). Preoperative characteristics, postoperative complications graded by the Clavien score and patient survival time were recorded and analyzed. Results: GBWR between the two groups were significantly different (0.67±0.05 vs. 0.97±0.17, p=0.000). There was no significant difference in preoperative demographic data as well as postoperative liver function data. Complication rate, median ICU stay and small-for-size syndrome incidence were similar in both groups. In univariate analysis, only MELD emerged as independent risk factor for small-for-size syndrome (p=0.045). Patient survival was similar in both groups at 1, 3 and 5 years as well. Conclusions: Using a GBWR of less than 0.8 is safe in selected recipients. To some extent, this result may attribute to the wide use of left-lobe living graft in AALDLT in future. © H.G.E.

84873308881	Quality of life and psychological distress of adult recipients after living donor liver transplantation	This longitudinal prospective study evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological distress among recipients after right-lobe adult-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). We measured HRQoL among 81 consecutive recipients using the Chinese version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). Psychological symptoms were measured using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Clinical data were collected from Chinese Liver Transplant Registry records. Sixty-two recipients completed follow-up assessments at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months posttransplantation. SF-36 domain scores were lowest at 6 months, especially for role-physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental component summary scale scores. They improved dramatically in the first year posttransplantation. None of the SF-36 domain scores differed significantly between 12 and 24 months. No SCL-90-R dimension score differed significantly among the four assessments (P >.05). Mental component summary scale scores significantly correlated with all four SCL-90-R global severity index scores (P <.05). HRQoL improved significantly in adult recipients in the first year after LDLT, but not thereafter.

84874116432	Genetic variants of p21 and p27 and hepatocellular cancer risk in a Chinese Han population: A case-control study	The p21 (Cip1/CDKN1A) and p27 (Kip1/CDKN1B) are members of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which can arrest cell proliferation and serve as tumour suppressors. We hypothesized that genetic variants in p21 and p27 may modify individual susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the associations of the polymorphisms of Ser31Arg and C+20T in p21 and C-79T and Gly109Val in p27, as well as their combinations, with HCC risk in a case-control study of 476 HCC cases and 526 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry method was performed to detect these polymorphisms. We found that the variant genotypes of p21 Ser31Arg and p27 C-79T were individually associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC, but no associations were observed for other variant genotypes. Moreover, the combined variant genotypes of the four loci were associated with a significantly increased HCC risk (adjusted OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.72, 2.91 among subjects carrying 3 or more variant alleles), especially among HbsAg-positive individuals (adjusted OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.86, 5.14). Furthermore, the combined variant genotypes of the four loci (carrying three or more variant alleles) increased a 1.93-fold (95% CI = 1.20, 3.09) and 1.76-fold (95% CI = 1.17, 2.64) risk of HCC among smokers and nonsmokers. The variant genotypes of the two genes in this study have negative correlation with the clinicopathologicals observed. These results suggest that p21 polymorphisms individually or in combination with p27 polymorphisms increases risk of HCC, particularly among HbsAg-positive individuals. What's new? Cell-cycle control proteins p21 and p27 can arrest cell proliferation, but alterations in these proteins could lead to cancer. In this study, the authors investigated whether individual variation in p21 and p27 contribute to risk of liver cancer in a Chinese population. By conducting a case-control study, they detected that certain p21 polymorphisms, either alone or in conjunction with p27 variants, can increase risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

84875385600	Value of α-fetoprotein in association with clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma	AIM: To explore the relationship between α-fetoprotein (AFP) and various clinicopathological variables and different staging system of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) thoroughly. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2008 and December 2009 in West China Hospital was enrolled in our study. The association of serum AFP values with the HCC clinicopathological features was analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis, such as status of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, tumor size, tumor number, vascular invasion and degree of tumor differentiation. Also, patients were divided into four groups at the time of enrollment according to different cutoff values for serum value of AFP (≤ 20 μg/L, 21-400 μg/L, 401-800 μg/L, and ≥ 801 μg/L), to compare the positive rate of patient among four groups stratified by various clinicopathological variables. And the correlation of different kinds of tumor staging systems, such as TNM, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification and China staging, were compared with the serum concentration of AFP. RESULTS: A total of 2304 HCC patients were enrolled in this study totally; the mean serum level of AFP was ± 546.6 μg/L. AFP levels were within the normal range (< 20 μg/L) in 27.4% (n = 631) of all the cases. 81.4% (n = 1875) patients were infected with HBV, and those patients had much higher serum AFP level compared with non-HBV infection ones (573.9 ± 547.7 μg/L vs 398.4 ± 522.3 μg/L, P < 0.001). The AFP level in tumors ≥ 10 cm (808.4 ± 529.2 μg/L) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those with tumor size 5-10 cm (499.5 ± 536.4 μg/L) and with tumor size ≤ 5 cm (444.9 ± 514.2 μg/L). AFP levels increased significantly in patients with vascular invasion (694.1 ± 546.9 μg/L vs 502.1 ± 543.1 μg/L, P < 0.001). Patients with low tumor cell differentiation (559.2 ± 545.7 μg/L) had the significantly (P = 0.007) highest AFP level compared with high differentiation (207.3 ± 420.8 μg/L) and intermediate differentiation (527.9 ± 538.4 μg/L). In the multiple variables analysis, low tumor cell differentiation [OR 6.362, 95%CI: 2.891-15.382, P = 0.006] and tumor size (≥ 10 cm) (OR 5.215, 95%CI: 1.426-13.151, P = 0.012) were independent predictors of elevated AFP concentrations (AFP > 400 μg/L). Serum AFP levels differed significantly (P < 0.001) in the D stage of BCLC (625.7 ± 529.8 μg/L) compared with stage A (506.2 ± μg/L) and B (590.1 ± 551.1 μg/L). CONCLUSION: HCC differentiation, size and vascular invasion have strong relationships with AFP, poor differentiation and HCC size ≥ 10 cm are independent predictors of elevated AFP. BCLC shows better relationship with AFP. © 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84880264741	Zinc finger protein A20 inhibits maturation of dendritic cells resident in rat liver allograft	Background: In organ transplant field, although viewed traditionally as instigators of organ allograft rejection, donor-derived interstitial dendritic cells (DCs), including those resident in liver, or host DCs have also been implicated in transplant tolerance in experimental models. This functional dichotomy of DC is governed by various factors, the most important of which appears to be their stage of maturation. This study was designed to examine the effect of zinc finger protein A20 on maturation of DCs resident in rat liver allograft. Materials and methods: Allogeneic (Dark Agouti [DA] rat to Lewis rat) liver transplantation was performed. Adenovirus carrying the full length of A20 was introduced into liver allografts by ex vivo perfusion via the portal vein during preservation (group A20), physiological saline (group PS), and empty Ad vector rAdEasy (group rAdEasy) that served as controls. Acute liver allograft rejection was assessed, and DCs resident in liver allografts were isolated on day 7 after transplantation. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-binding activities, surface expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86), expression of interleukin (IL) 12 messenger RNA (mRNA), and allocostimulatory capacity of DCs were measured with electrophoretic mobility shift assay, flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), respectively. Results: Ex vivo transfer of A20 adenovirus by portal vein infusion resulted in overexpression of A20 protein in liver allograft after transplantation. On day 7 after transplantation, histologic examination revealed a mild rejection in group A20 but a more severe rejection in group PS and group rAdEasy. DCs from group A20 liver allografts exhibited features of immature DC with detectable but very low level of NF-κB activity, IL-12 mRNA expression, and surface expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86), whereas DCs from group rAdEasy and group PS liver allograft displayed features of mature DC with high level of NF-κB activity, IL-12 mRNA expression, and surface expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86). DCs from group PS and group rAdEasy liver allograft were potent inducers of DNA synthesis and interferon γ production in MLR, and DCs from group A20 liver allografts induced only minimal levels of cell proliferation and interferon γ production in MLR. Conclusions: These data suggest that A20 overexpression could effectively inhibit maturation of DCs resident in liver allograft and consequently suppress acute liver allograft rejection.

84882238237	Hepatitis B prophylaxis using lamivudine and individualized low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin in living donor liver transplantation	Background Currently, most available experience concerning prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is limited to studies of small size and short follow-up. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a prophylactic regimen using lamivudine and individualized low-dose intramuscular hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) in LDLT. Methods We used a database of adult-to-adult right-lobe LDLT procedures performed from June 2002 to April 2012 at our center for HBV-related end-stage liver diseases. Patients were divided into 3 groups: group A, HBV-related decompensated liver cirrhosis; group B, fulminant hepatitis B; and group C, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results During a mean follow-up of 38.3 ± 28.9 months, 8 of 165 (4.8%) recipients developed HBV recurrences. The mean time for HBV reinfection was 15.8 + 11.0 months after transplantation. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year HBV recurrence rates were 3%, 7%, and 8.2%, respectively. Both patients with fulminant hepatitis B or HCC seemed to have higher rates of HBV recurrence than those with decompensated liver cirrhosis, albeit not significantly. The independent predictor of HBV recurrence was high HBV DNA level (≥10

84882693222	Scoring Selection Criteria Including Total Tumour Volume and Pretransplant Percentage of Lymphocytes to Predict Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Liver Transplantation	Aim:The selection criteria for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to undergo liver transplantation should accurately predict posttransplant recurrence while not denying potential beneficiaries. In the present study, we attempted to identify risk factors associated with posttransplant recurrence and to expand the selection criteria.Patients and Methods:Adult patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation between November 2004 and September 2012 at our centre were recruited into the current study (N = 241). Clinical and pathological data were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who died during the perioperative period or died of non-recurrence causes were excluded from this study (N = 25). All potential risk factors were analysed using uni- and multi-variate analyses.Results:Sixty-one recipients of 216 qualified patients suffered from recurrence. Similar recurrence-free and long-term survival rates were observed between living donor liver transplant recipients (N = 60) and deceased donor liver transplant recipients (N = 156). Total tumour volume (TTV) and preoperative percentage of lymphocytes (L%) were two independent risk factors in the multivariate analysis. We propose a prognostic score model based on these two risk factors. Patients within our criteria achieved a similar recurrence-free survival to patients within the Milan criteria. Seventy-one patients who were beyond the Milan criteria but within our criteria also had comparable survival to patients within the Milan criteria.Conclusions:TTV and L% are two risk factors that contribute to posttransplant recurrence. Selection criteria based on these two factors, which are proposed by our study, expanded the Milan criteria without increasing the risk of posttransplant recurrence. © 2013 Li et al.

84893346299	Risk factors for early recurrence of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria after curative resection	Background: The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection varies greatly. Few studies had investigated the risk factors for early recurrence (recurrence-free time = 1 year) of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCCs meeting Milan criteria. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the 224 patients with HCC meeting Milan criteria who underwent curative liver resection in our center between February 2007 and March 2012. The overall survival (OS) rate, recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate and risk factors for early recurrence were analyzed. Results: After a median follow-up of 33.3 months, HCC reoccurred in 105 of 224 patients and 32 died during the period. The 1-, 3-and 5-year OS rates were 97.3%, 81.6% and 75.6% respectively, and the 1-, 3-and 5-year RFS rates were 73.2%, 53.7% and 41.6%. Cox regression showed alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > 800 ng/ml (HR 2.538, 95% CI 1.464-4.401, P=0.001), multiple tumors (HR 2.286, 95% CI 1.123-4.246, P=0.009) and microvascular invasion (HR 2.518, 95% CI 1.475-4.298, P=0.001) to be associated with early recurrence (recurrence-free time ≤ 1-year) of HCC meeting Milan criteria. Conclusions: AFP > 800 ng/ml, multiple tumors and microvascular invasion are independent risk factors affecting early postoperative recurrence of HCC. In addition resection appears capable of replacing liver transplantation in some situations with safety and a better outcome.

84896544546	Comparison of Laparoscopy-Assisted and Open Donor Right Hepatectomy: A Prospective Case-Matched Study from China	Background: Laparoscopy-assisted hepatectomy is a new minimally invasive approach for graft harvesting in living donors. Only a few liver transplant centers have introduced this surgical procedure. Methods: A prospective case-matched study was conducted on 25 consecutive donors who underwent laparoscopy-assisted donor right hepatectomy (LADRH) between July 2011 and March 2013 at our transplant center. These donors were matched 1:1 according to age, gender, and body mass index with 25 donors who underwent open donor right hepatectomy (ODRH). Results: LADRH was successfully performed in all 25 of the donors. Donor complications, estimated blood loss, and operative time were similar between the groups. Hospital stay and periods of analgesic use were significantly shorter in the LADRH group [7.0 ± 1.4 (LADRH) vs 8.7 ± 2.4 (ODRH), p = 0.003, and 2.4 ± 1.0 (LADRH) vs 3.2 ± 1.0 (ODRH), p = 0.011, respectively). The total in-hospital cost is higher with LADRH, primarily due to the additional material costs for LADRH. Finally, there were no differences in graft size, graft survival, or recipient complications between the two groups. Conclusion: The results of this study show that LADRH is a feasible and safe procedure compared with ODRH. Although higher material costs for laparoscopic assisted procedures are inevitable, LADRH may have an advantage over ODRH by causing less pain and facilitating earlier recovery. Efforts can be made to improve the technical success of LADRH for some overweight donors. © 2013 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

84898804928	The critical value of remnant liver volume-to-body weight ratio to estimate posthepatectomy liver failure in cirrhotic patients	Background The extensive use of major hepatectomy for liver malignancies with cirrhosis increases the risk of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), which is associated with a high frequency of postoperative complications, mortality, and an increased length of hospital stay. Remnant liver volume-to-body weight ratio (RLV-BWR) is more specific than the ratio of RLV-to-total liver volume (RLV-TLV) in predicting postoperative course after major hepatectomy in normal liver. Patients having normal liver with an anticipated RLV-BWR ≥0.5% are at considerable risk for hepatic dysfunction and postoperative mortality. In the present study, the critical value of RLV-BWR after liver resection in cirrhotic liver was investigated. Patients and methods Thirty one patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma in one medical treatment unit of West China Hospital from September 2012 to December 2012 were retrospectively enrolled in study. Volumetric measurements of TLV using computed tomography were obtained before hepatectomy. PHLF was diagnosed by the "50-50 criteria." The influence of RLV-TLV and RLV-BWR on the occurrence of PHLF was investigated, and the critical value of RLV-BWR was concluded. Results According to the occurrence of PHLF, the patients were retrospectively divided into PHLF group and non-PHLF group. There were no statistical differences of preoperative indicators between the two groups. The intraoperative indicators including the resected liver volume, RLV-TLV, and RLV-BWR were statistically significant (P 0.05) between the two groups. The postoperative indicators including total bilirubin (TBIL), international normalized ratio, and peritoneal drainage fluid at the third and the fifth day after surgery were statistically significant (P 0.05) between the two groups. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) predicted by RLV-BWR to the incidence of PHLF was 0.864 (P = 0.019) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI = 0.608-0.819), and the sensitivity and specialty rate were 70% and 95%, which were more than 50% and 70%, respectively. It suggested that the critical value of RLV-BWR (1.4%) had a certain predictive value on PHLF. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve predicted by RLV-TLV to the incidence of PHLF was 0.568 (P = 0.628) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI = 0.376-0.747), and the sensitivity and specialty rate were 42.9% and 82.6%, respectively. The sensitivity (42.9%)50% suggested that the critical value of RLV-TLR (51%) had a poor predictive value on PHLF. According to the curve critical value 1.4% of RLV-BWR, the patients were divided into RLV-BWR ≥1.4% group and RLV-BWR1.4% group, and the incidence of PHLF between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.006). Conclusions RLV-BWR was more specific than RLV-TLV in predicting PHLF after major hepatectomy of cirrhotic liver. Patients with an anticipated RLV-BWR <1.4% are at considerable risk for PHLF. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84901449843	Immediate Radical Therapy or Conservative Treatments When Meeting the Milan Criteria for Advanced HCC Patients After Successful TACE	Background and aims: Many advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be successfully downstaged into the Milan criteria; however, immediate radical therapy cannot be applied to all such patients for various reasons. Of the patients who are not eligible for immediate radical therapy, some accept repeated downstaging therapies and some undergo persistent observation. The aim of the present study was to compare long-term survival between these two groups of patients. Patients and Methods: Between August 2003 and October 2008, 156 HCC patients successfully received downstaging therapy resulting in compliance with the Milan criteria. Of those, 98 cases accepted radical therapies, including liver transplantation (LT), resection, or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (group 1), and 58 cases underwent repeated transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or persistent observation (group 2). The baseline characteristics, demographic data, downstaging protocol, and information on long-term outcomes were collected and compared. Results: No significant differences were observed in the patient demographic data, downstaging protocols, or tumor characteristics between the two groups. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 92.9, 82.7, and 78.6 %, respectively, in group 1, whereas these rates were 82.8, 65.5, and 48.3 %, respectively, in group 2 (P = 0.046). Among the 58 patients in group 2, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 92.3, 65.4, and 46.2 %, respectively, in the repeated TACE group, and 81.3, 65.6, and 50 %, respectively, in the persistent observation group (P = 0.783). Conclusion: Immediate radical therapy should be the first choice for advanced HCC patients who undergo successful TACE, and repeated TACE is unnecessary. © 2014 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

84902598842	Primary graft dysfunction after liver transplantation	BACKGROUND: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) causes complications in liver transplantation, which result in poor prognosis. Recipients who develop PGD usually experience a longer intensive care unit and hospital stay and have higher mortality and graft loss rates compared with those without graft dysfunction. However, because of the lack of universally accepted definition, early diagnosis of graft dysfunction is difficult. Additionally, numerous factors affect the allograft function after transplantation, making the prediction of PGD more difficult. The present review was to analyze the literature available on PGD and to propose a definition. DATA SOURCE: A search of PubMed (up to the end of 2012) for English-language articles relevant to PGD was performed to clarify the characteristics, risk factors, and possible treatments or interventions for PGD. RESULTS: There is no pathological diagnostic standard; many documented definitions of PGD are different. Many factors, such as donor status, procurement and transplant process and recipient illness may affect the function of graft, and ischemia-reperfusion injury is considered the direct cause. Potential managements which are helpful to improve graft function were investigated. Some of them are promising. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggested that the definition of PGD should include one or more of the following variables: (1) bilirubin ≥10 mg/dL on postoperative day 7; (2) international normalized ratio ≥1.6 on postoperative day 7; and (3) alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >2000 IU/L within 7 postoperative days. Reducing risk factors may decrease the incidence of PGD. A majority of the recipients could recover from PGD; however, when the graft progresses into primary non-function, the patients need to be treated with re-transplantation. © 2014, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

84904247792	Child-Pugh A Hepatitis B-Related Cirrhotic Patients with a Single Hepatocellular Carcinoma Up to 5 cm: Liver Transplantation vs. Resection	Objective: This study aims to analyze the outcomes of patients with Child-Pugh A class cirrhosis and a single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) up to 5 cm in diameter who underwent liver transplantation vs. resection. Methods: During 2007 to 2012, 282 Child-Pugh A cirrhotic patients with a single HCC up to 5 cm in diameter either underwent liver resection (N = 243) or received liver transplantation (N = 39) at our center. Patient and tumor characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. Results: Patients who underwent liver transplantation had a better recurrence-free survival (RFS) vs. those who underwent liver resection. However, the 5-year survival rates after these two treatments were comparable. Similar results were observed when we analyzed patients with a HCC less than 3 cm, and for patients with portal hypertension. In the multivariate analysis, tumor differentiation, difference of primary treatment, and presence of microvascular invasion were associated with postoperative recurrence. However, only differentiation negatively impacted overall survival after operation. Conclusion: Although more recurrences were observed in Child A cirrhotic patients with a single HCC up to 5 cm after liver resection, liver resection offers a similar 5-year survival to liver transplantation, even for patients with portal hypertension. © 2014 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

84906061035	DNA methylome profiling of maternal peripheral blood and placentas reveal potential fetal DNA markers for non-invasive prenatal testing	Utilizing epigenetic(DNA methylation) differences to differentiate between maternal peripheral blood (PBL) and fetal (placental) DNA has been a promising strategy for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). However, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have yet to be fully ascertained. In the present study, we performed genome-wide comparative methylome analysis between maternal PBL and placental DNA from pregnancies of first trimester by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) and Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip assays. A total of 36 931 DMRs and 45 804 differentially methylated sites (DMSs) covering the whole genome, exclusive of the Y chromosome, were identified via MeDIP-Seq and Infinium 450k array, respectively, of which 3759 sites in 2188 regions were confirmed by both methods. Not only did we find the previously reported potential fetal DNA markers in our identified DMRs/DMSs but also we verified fully the identified DMRs/DMSs in the validation round by MassARRAY EpiTYPER. The screened potential fetal DNA markers may be used for NIPT on aneuploidies and other chromosomal diseases, such as cri du chat syndromeand velo-cardio-facial syndrome. In addition, these potential markers may have application in the early diagnosis of placental dysfunction, such as pre-eclampsia. © The Author 2014.

84909595141	Effect of low-dose tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil on renal function following liver transplantation	AIM: To determine whether low-dose tacrolimus (TAC) combined with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a safe approach to decrease the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in liver transplantation (LT) recipients. METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of 689 patients who underwent LT between March 1999 and December 2012 in a single Chinese center. Immunosuppression was initiated with a calcineurin inhibitor (TAC or CSA) and prednisone with or without MMF. CKD is defined by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated by an abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for at least 3 consecutive months after LT. Individuals with TAC trough concentrations ≤ 8 ng/mL at 3 mo after LT were defined as the low-dose group. The incidence of CKD within 5 years was compared between the TAC group and the CSA group, as well as between four subgroups (low-dose and high-dose TAC groups with or without MMF). RESULTS: No difference regarding the occurrence of pre-LT renal dysfunction or that of post-LT rejection was found between the TAC and CSA groups or between the four subgroups. With a definition of GFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the overall incidence of CKD was significantly higher in the CSA group than in the TAC group. The incidence of CKD in the low-dose TAC + MMF group (7.7%) was significantly lower than that observed in the low-dose TAC group (15.9%), high-dose TAC group (24.6%) and high-dose TAC + MMF group (18.5%). The cumulative 1-, 3- and 5-year incidence rates of CKD were 12.7%, 14.5% and 16.7%, respectively. The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 61.7% and 82.2% in patients with or without CKD, respectively. CONCLUSION: In LT patients, the choice of immunosuppressive therapy appears to affect renal function and patient survival.
