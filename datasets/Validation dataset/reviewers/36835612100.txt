33746259594	Preparation of PVP helical fibres by electrospinning and study on the mechanism of helix formation	Helical fibres of PVP were fabricated by electrospinning. The morphologies of helical fibre were observed by scanning electron microscopy. PVP ethanol solutions with different mass fractions (12%, 14%, 16%, 20% and 24%) were electrospun at the voltage of 9 kV. With increase of PVP mass fraction, the morphologies of PVP fiber changed from straight, helical, folded to disordered form. Helical fibres were obtained when the mass fractions of PVP solution changed in the range of 16%-20%. The solutions were also electrospun at different voltages from 6 kV to 13 kV, respectively. The result show those regular helical fibres could be obtained in a wide voltage range when PVP solution with a mass fraction of 20% was electrospun. The mechanism of the formation of helical fibre was discussed. Coulomb excluding force between static charges carried by fibres during the process of electrospinning was the main factor to form helical fibre.

33846253109	Variety of photoluminescence intensity of fluorescent whitening agents introduced into polyacrylonitrile nanofibers	The major objective in this study was the preparation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers composed of 1,4-bis(o-cyanostyryl)benzene (ER) and 1-(o-cyanostyryl)-4-(p-cyanostyryl)benzene (EB), two kinds of fluorescent whitening agents widely used in the textile industry. The scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the diameters of ER/PAN and EB/PAN fibers ranged from 78 to 154 nm. The IR spectra indicated that the peaks of the -CN group blueshift and the generation of a shoulder peak were obviously due to the interaction between ER or EB and PAN. Furthermore, the UV spectra demonstrated that the distributive status of ER or EB tended toward the molecular state in PAN nanofibers. Finally, the most interesting finding in this study was that the photoluminescence intensity of EB/ PAN nanofibers increased magnificently, whereas that of ER/PAN nanofibers decreased remarkably. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34447512913	Evidence for Positive Darwinian Selection of Vip Gene in Bacillus thuringiensis	Vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIPs), produced during the vegetative stage of their growth in Bacillus thuringiensis, are a group of insecticidal proteins and represent the second generation of insecticidal trans-genes that will complement the novel d-endotoxins in future. Fewer structural and functional relationships of Vip proteins are known in comparison with those of d-endotoxins. In this study, both the maximum-likelihood methods and the maximum parsimony based sliding window analysis were used to evaluate the molecular evolution of Vip proteins. As a result, strong evidence was found that Vip proteins are subject to the high rates of positive selection, and 16 sites are identified to be under positive selection using the Bayes Empirical Bayesian method. Interestingly, all these positively selected sites are located from site-705 to site-809 in the C-terminus of the Vip proteins. Most of these sites are exposed and clustered in the loop regions when mapped onto its computational predicted secondary tertiary and a part of the tertiary structure. It has been postulated that the high divergence in the C-terminal of Vip proteins may not result from the lack of functional constraints, but rather from the rapid mutation to adapt their targeted insects, driven by positive selection. The potential positive selection pressures may be an attempt to adapt for the "arm race" between Vip proteins and the targeted insects, or to enlarge their target's host range. Sites identified to be under positive selection may be related to the insect host range, which may shed a light on the investigation of the Vip proteins' structural and functional relationships. © 2007 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

34548760723	Adaptive Evolution of cry Genes in Bacillus thuringiensis: Implications for Their Specificity Determination	The cry gene family, produced during the late exponential phase of growth in Bacillus thuringiensis, is a large, still-growing family of homologous genes, in which each gene encodes a protein with strong specific activity against only one or a few insect species. Extensive studies are mostly focusing on the structural and functional relationships of Cry proteins, and have revealed several residues or domains that are important for the target recognition and receptor attachment. In this study, we have employed a maximum likelihood method to detect evidence of adaptive evolution in Cry proteins, and have identified 24 positively selected residues, which are all located in Domain II or III. Combined with known data from mutagenesis studies, the majority of these residues, at the molecular level, contribute much to the insect specificity determination. We postulate that the potential pressures driving the diversification of Cry proteins may be in an attempt to adapt for the "arm race" between δ-endotoxins and the targeted insects, or to enlarge their target spectra, hence result in the functional divergence. The sites identified to be under positive selection would provide targets for further structural and functional analyses on Cry proteins. © 2007 Beijing Genomics Institute.

35348976629	The impact of sewage discharge on the macroalgae community in the Yellow Sea coastal area around Qingdao, China	The dynamics of macroalgal communities and the impact of sewage on their growth were studied in the tidal zone around Zhanqiao Pier of the Qingdao coastal area, in the northwest of the Yellow Sea, China, from September 2001 to September 2003. The tidal zone of the study area is divided into western and eastern sections by the Zhanqiao Pier. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in seawater showed higher concentrations on the eastern side of Zhanqiao Pier than on the western side, because a sewer drains into the eastern side. The macroalgal communities on each side of the Pier showed an obvious difference due to the effect of this sewage discharge. A total of 47 macroalgal species including 10 greens, 11 browns and 26 reds was identified in this study. The species composition and biomass indicated higher values in the nutrient-rich area on the eastern side of Zhanqiao Pier compared with the nutrient-poor area on the western side of Zhanqiao Pier. Some ephemeral and filamentous species dominated seasonally on the eastern side of Zhanqiao Pier, in contrast to the western side where slow-growing species dominated throughout the year. Nutrient gradients and temperature were considered the main factors affecting the distribution of macroalgae communities in time and space. The results are consistent with the common observation that nutrient-poor areas are dominated by slow-growing rather than ephemeral algal species. Moreover, the species diversity in the whole study area had declined when compared to previous records. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

35349014124	Seasonal variation of inorganic nutrient uptake by heterotrophic bacterioplankton in Jiaozhou Bay, North China	The distribution patterns and factors affecting uptake rates and turnover times of dissolved inorganic nutrients by heterotrophic bacterioplankton (HB) in Jiaozhou Bay were studied based on in situ surveys and laboratory culturing. The uptake rates of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) by HB are limited by the temperature of the water and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon. The turnover times of DIP and DIN by HB are regulated by the concentrations of the nutrients and the numbers of HB, which show significant spatiotemporal variability in Jiaozhou Bay. HB may aggravate the P-limitation of phytoplankton by competing for phosphorus in summer in Jiaozhou Bay. HB play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and may increase the N:P ratio and the accumulation of DIN, thereby accelerating the imbalance of the N:P ratio in Jiaozhou Bay. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

37349055176	ArchaeaTF: An integrated database of putative transcription factors in Archaea	Identification of all the transcription factors (TFs) encoded in a given genome is a prerequisite for understanding transcriptional regulatory networks. Archaea are prokaryotes that constitute one of the three main branches of organisms with an astounding diversity of habitats. In this report, we establish the ArchaeaTF database to provide an integrated information resource about TFs in Archaea, such as basic characteristics, domain architectures, and sequence similarities against the linked databases. Through its Web interface, ArchaeaTF provides three different ways for users to retrieve the data: simple browse, keyword search, and BLAST search. Moreover, ArchaeaTF can serve as a useful platform for comparative genomics analysis of archaeal TFs since it implements a series of tools, including MUSCLE for multiple sequence alignments of the DNA-binding domains, QuickTree for phylogenetic tree construction, and OrthoMCL for ortholog identification. The released ArchaeaTF 1.0 contains 2135 putative TFs from 37 completed archaeal genomes. In conclusion, we believe that ArchaeaTF will be a useful resource and convenient platform for researchers working on TFs and transcriptional regulatory networks to retrieve information from TFs in Archaea rapidly.

38149134526	The influence of polystyrene and polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofiber on the intensity of photoluminescence of fluorescent whitening agents	1-(o-Cyanostyryl)-4-(p-cyanostyryl) benzene (EB) and 1,4-bis(o-cyanostyryl) benzene (ER) were two fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) widely used in textile industry. The major subject in this work was to investigate whether EB and ER could be introduced into polystyrene (PS) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanofiber by electrospinning. Another aim of this work was to detect the intensity of photoluminescence (IPL) of EB and ER in the nanofiber of PS and PVP. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that the diameter of the obtained nanofiber ranged from 74 to 366 nm. The ultraviolet (UV) spectra demonstrated that EB and ER existed in PS and PVP nanofiber. In addition, the concentrations of EB and ER in PS and PVP nanofiber were calculated according to the determination of UV spectra. Moreover, the IPLs of EB and ER in PS nanofiber increased magnificently, especially EB in PS nanofiber. On the contrary, the IPLs of these two FWAs in PVP nanofiber decreased remarkably. This information might be useful in the application for textile industry. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34247853207	cTFbase: A database for comparative genomics of transcription factors in cyanobacteria	Background: Comprehensive identification and classification of the transcription factors (TFs) in a given genome is an important aspect in understanding transcriptional regulatory networks of a specific organism. Cyanobacteria are an ancient group of gram-negative bacteria with strong variation in genome size ranging from about 1.6 to 9.1 Mb and little is known about their TF repertoires. Therefore, we constructed the cTFbase database to classify and analyze all the putative TFs in cyanobacterial genomes, followed by genome-wide comparative analysis. Description: In the current release, cTFbase contains 1288 putative TFs identified from 21 fully sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. Through its user-friendly interactive interface, users can employ various criteria to retrieve all TF sequences and their detailed annotation information, including sequence features, domain architecture and sequence similarity against the linked databases. Furthermore, cTFbase provides phylogenetic trees of individual TF family, multiple sequence alignments of the DNA-binding domains and ortholog identification from any selected genomes. Comparative analysis revealed great variability of the TF sequences in cyanobacterial genomes. The high variance on the gene number and domain organization would be related to their diverse biological functions and their adaptation to various environmental conditions. Conclusion: cTFbase provides a centralized warehouse for comparative analysis of putative TFs in cyanobacterial genomes. The availability of such an extensive database would be of great interest for the community of researchers working on TFs or transcriptional regulatory networks in cyanobacteria. cTFbase can be freely accessible at http://cegwz.com/ and will be continuously updated when the newly sequenced cyanobacterial genomes are available. © 2007 Wu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images indicated that the attachment of CdTe nanoparticles enlarged the diameter of P4VP nanofibers. Moreover, the results of the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum and the electron diffraction pattern revealed that the deposition on the surface of P4VP nanofibers was CdTe in a cubic lattice. Furthermore, CdTe existed in its optical style according to photoluminescence spectra. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verified Cd in CdTe nanoparticles combined with the N atom in P4VP nanofibers. Therefore, the obtained results provide some references for preparing coaxial nanofibers attached by other nanoparticles. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84861711100	Investigation of ultra-and nanofiltration for separation of proteins and lactose from dairy wastewater	In this study, the proteins and lactose were separated from dairy wastewater using ultrafiltration. The effect of transmembrane pressure, feed flowrate, concentration factor on the recycle results are studied systematically. The permeate flux, protein and lactose content in the permeation and in the concentrate fractions were measured during the experimental runs. Meanwhile, the removal efficiency of COD is checked. It was found that ultrafiltration membrane provided 94-97 % recovery of protein in dairy wastewater and nanofiltration membrane provided 100 % recovery of lactose in ultrafiltration permeate. An increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP) increased the permeate flux which increased the rate of protein and lactose being recovered. The nanofiltration membrane showed approximately 96-99 % rejection of COD, the percentage being low at lower transmembrane pressures (greater than 10 bar) and high and higher transmembrane pressures (less than 10 bar). The nanofiltration permeate could be up to the standard of reusable water.

48449104314	Lineage-specific domain fusion in the evolution of purine nucleotide cyclases in cyanobacteria	Cyclic nucleotides (both cAMP and cGMP) play extremely important roles in cyanobacteria, such as regulating heterocyst formation, respiration, or gliding. Catalyzing the formation of cAMP and cGMP from ATP and GTP is a group of functionally important enzymes named adenylate cyclases and guanylate cyclases, respectively. To understand their evolutionary patterns, in this study, we presented a systematic analysis of all the cyclases in cyanobacterial genomes. We found that different cyanobacteria had various numbers of cyclases in view of their remarkable diversities in genome size and physiology. Most of these cyclases exhibited distinct domain architectures, which implies the versatile functions of cyanobacterial cyclases. Mapping the whole set of cyclase domain architectures from diverse prokaryotic organisms to their phylogenetic tree and detailed phylogenetic analysis of cyclase catalytic domains revealed that lineage-specific domain recruitment appeared to be the most prevailing pattern contributing to the great variability of cyanobacterial cyclase domain architectures. However, other scenarios, such as gene duplication, also occurred during the evolution of cyanobacterial cyclases. Sequence divergence seemed to contribute to the origin of putative guanylate cyclases which were found only in cyanobacteria. In conclusion, the comprehensive survey of cyclases in cyanobacteria provides novel insight into their potential evolutionary mechanisms and further functional implications. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77956331001	Sequencing and genetic variation of multidrug resistance plasmids in Klebsiella pneumoniae	Background: The development of multidrug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of pathogenic microorganisms by distinct antimicrobial agents. Characterizing the genetic variation among plasmids from different bacterial species or strains is a key step towards understanding the mechanism of virulence and their evolution. Results: We applied a deep sequencing approach to 206 clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae collected from 2002 to 2008 to understand the genetic variation of multidrug resistance plasmids, and to reveal the dynamic change of drug resistance over time. First, we sequenced three plasmids (70 Kb, 94 Kb, and 147 Kb) from a clonal strain of K. pneumoniae using Sanger sequencing. Using the Illumina sequencing technology, we obtained more than 17 million of short reads from two pooled plasmid samples. We mapped these short reads to the three reference plasmid sequences, and dentified a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these pooled plasmids. Many of these SNPs are present in drugresistance genes. We also found that a significant fraction of short reads could not be mapped to the reference sequences, indicating a high degree of genetic variation among the collection of K. pneumoniae isolates. Moreover, we identified that plasmid conjugative transfer genes and antibiotic resistance genes are more likely to suffer from positive selection, as indicated by the elevated rates of nonsynonymous substitution. Conclusion: These data represent the first large-scale study of genetic variation in multidrug resistance plasmids and provide insight into the mechanisms of plasmid diversification and the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance. © 2010 Zhao et al.

77957601090	Complete genome sequence of the rifamycin SV-producing Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32 revealed its genetic characteristics in phylogeny and metabolism	Amycolatopsis mediterranei is used for industry-scale production of rifamycin, which plays a vital role in antimycobacterial therapy. As the first sequenced genome of the genus Amycolatopsis, the chromosome of strain U32 comprising 10 236 715 base pairs, is one of the largest prokaryotic genomes ever sequenced so far. Unlike the linear topology found in streptomycetes, this chromosome is circular, particularly similar to that of Saccharopolyspora erythraea and Nocardia farcinica, representing their close relationship in phylogeny and taxonomy. Although the predicted 9 228 protein-coding genes in the A. mediterranei genome shared the greatest number of orthologs with those of S. erythraea, it was unexpectedly followed by Streptomyces coelicolor rather than N. farcinica, indicating the distinct metabolic characteristics evolved via adaptation to diverse ecological niches. Besides a core region analogous to that common in streptomycetes, a novel 'quasi-core' with typical core characteristics is defined within the non-core region, where 21 out of the total 26 gene clusters for secondary metabolite production are located. The rifamycin biosynthesis gene cluster located in the core encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme essential for the conversion of rifamycin SV to B, revealed by comparing to the highly homologous cluster of the rifamycin B-producing strain S699 and further confirmed by genetic complementation. The genomic information of A. mediterranei demonstrates a metabolic network orchestrated not only for extensive utilization of various carbon sources and inorganic nitrogen compounds but also for effective funneling of metabolic intermediates into the secondary antibiotic synthesis process under the control of a seemingly complex regulatory mechanism. © 2010 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

79951797943	Degeneration mechanism research of Suaeda heteroptera wetland of the Shuangtaizi Estuary national nature reserve in China	Recently, Suaeda heteroptera wetland of the Shuangtaizi River Estuary national nature reserve in China degenerated seriously, and this has led to a decrease in the Saunders' Gull population. In this study, the nitrogen, phosphor, organic matter and soluble salt contents in soil were determined, and the biomass(dry weight) and plant height were determined too aiming to explore the mechanism of degeneration of the Suaeda heteroptera population. The nitrogen, phosphor and organic matter contents in four types of wetland were all at D level and fertility degree was lower, It could be inferred that nutrients in soil was not the reason of degeneration of Suaeda heteroptera wetland. However, the soluble salt in mudflat soil reached as high as 2.51% in the spring and was significantly higher than that in other three types of wetland. This might be an important reason that the wetland degenerates into mudflat. We could conclude that the long time of no flooding and strong evaporation caused the increasing of salinity of soil and eventually cause the death of Suaeda heteroptera. In addition to human factors, the natural succession with the enlargement of new mudflat is one of the important reasons that make Suaeda heteroptera wetland disappear somewhere. The restoration measures must conform to the direction of natural evolution, otherwise, this restoration may be not sustainable. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

82555191203	Characteristics of temporal and spatial distribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in Liaohe Estuary wetland soil	The nitrification from ammonia to nitrate is a rate-limiting step mediated by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The abundances and diversity of AOB in the soil of reed wetland of Liaohe Estuary were investigated by the most probable number (MPN) method and the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique, and the relationship between AOB abundances and environmental factors, such as soluble salt, was further explored. The results indicated that the temporal and spatial distribution of the AOB diversity was different, and the bacterial community on the different sites was more similar in same month. The quantity of AOB and the concentration of soluble salt presented notable negative correlation (P<0.05), while the quantity of AOB and soil total nitrogen and organ matter presented a significant positive correlation (P<0.01). It concluded that the soluble salt, soil total nitrogen and orgaic matter had an important influence on the quantity of AOB in Liaohe Estuary wetland.

84865332430	Distribution and risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from Liaohe estuarine wetland soils	Thirty-one surface soil samples were collected from Liaohe estuarine wetland in October 2008 and May and August 2009. The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), identified as priority pollutants by the US EPA, were measured by gas chromatography. PAHs were predominated by three- and four-ring compounds. The total PAH concentrations ranged from 704.7 to 1,804.5 μg/kg with a mean value of 1,001.9 μg/kg in October 2008, from 509.7 to 1,936.9 μg/kg with an average of 887.1 μg/kg in May 2009, and from 293.4 to 1,735.9 μg/kg with a mean value of 675.4 μg/kg in August 2009. The PAH concentration detected at most sites shared the same pattern, with maximum concentrations during the autumn (October) and minimum concentrations during the summer (August). The ecological risk assessment of PAHs showed that adverse effects would occasionally occur in the soils from Liaohe estuarine wetland based on the effects range low (ERL)/effects range median and the toxic equivalency factors. The results revealed that some of the individual PAHs were in excess of ERL which implied possible acute adverse biological effects. The BaP

84871728533	Application of the analytic hierarchy process to a sustainability assessment of coastal beach exploitation: A case study of the wind power projects on the coastal beaches of Yancheng, China	Sustainability assessments of coastal beach exploitation are difficult because the identification of appropriate monitoring methodologies and evaluation procedures is still ongoing. In particular, the most suitable procedure for the application of sustainability assessment to coastal beaches remains uncertain. This paper presents a complete sustainability assessment process for coastal beach exploitation based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). We developed an assessment framework consisting of 14 indicators derived from the three dimensions of suitability, economic and social value, and ecosystem. We chose a wind power project on a coastal beach of Yancheng as a case study. The results indicated that the wind power farms on the coastal beach were not completely in keeping with sustainable development theory. The construction of the wind power farms had some negative impacts. Therefore, in the design stage, wind turbines should be designed and planned carefully to minimize these negative impacts. In addition, the case study demonstrated that the AHP was capable of addressing the complexities associated with the sustainability of coastal beaches. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Soil samples were collected from both restored and unrestored wetlands in Shuangtaizi estuary, and then we compared seasonal changes of soil properties in these two areas. The results indicated a significant increase of NH4-N, whereas TP(total phosphorous) declined slightly in restored wetland. In addition, significant seasonal variations of SOM(soil organic matter) and nutrients were exhibited in restored and unrestored wetlands especially in July and August. Meanwhile, we found that C/P ratio in restored wetland increased in summer and reduced in September. All these have suggested that soil properties and nutrients proportions were changed after the restoration, which would be more conductive for soil ecological function. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84875382517	Insights into the evolution of gene organization and multidrug resistance from Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pKF3-140	Plasmid-mediated transfer of drug-resistance genes among various bacterial species is considered one of the most important mechanisms for the spread of multidrug resistance. To gain insights into the evolution of gene organization and antimicrobial resistance in clinical bacterial samples, a complete plasmid genome of Klebsiella pneumoniae pKF3-140 is determined, which has a circular chromosome of 147,416. bp in length. Among the 203 predicted genes, 142 have function assignment and about 50 appear to be involved in plasmid replication, maintenance, conjugative transfer, iron acquisition and transport, and drug resistance. Extensive comparative genomic analyses revealed that pKF3-140 exhibits a rather low sequence similarity and structural conservation with other reported K. pneumoniae plasmids. In contrast, the overall organization of pKF3-140 is highly similar to Escherichia coli plasmids p1ESCUM and pUTI89, which indicates the possibility that K. pneumoniae pKF3-140 may have a potential origin in E. coli. Meanwhile, interestingly, several drug resistant genes show high similarity to the plasmid pU302L in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium U302 strain G8430 and the plasmid pK245 in K. pneumoniae. This mosaic pattern of sequence similarities suggests that pKF3-140 might have arisen from E. coli and acquired the resistance genes from a variety of enteric bacteria and underscores the importance of a further understanding of horizontal gene transfer among enteric bacteria. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84884920720	Influence of salinity on distribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in Laohe estuarine wetland, China	Soil salinization in Laohe estuarine wetland is becoming more serious, thus the characteristics of AOB in different salt salinity have drawn more attention. Our study investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in different salinity soils in Laohe estuarine wetland. Results show that the largest amount of AOB appeared when salinity was 10g/kg, and decrease when salinity was higher (15g/kg, 20g/kg) or lower (2g/kg, 5g/kg). The distribution of AOB shows that the AOB amount is larger in surface layer (0-20cm) than middle layer (20-40cm) or the bottom layer (40-60cm); the AOB is more abundant in summer than autumn. Results indicate that salinity is a key factor on the AOB abundance, but not an influencer on the vertical and temporal distribution of AOB in estuarine wetland. Temperature and organic content are the related factors of the vertical distribution of AOB abundance, and the growth of reed is also an important influence factor on the variation of AOB during different seasons. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The extraction efficiency is also increased with the increase of phase ratio and phosphoric acid concentration. The optimal phase ratio and phosphoric acid concentration are 2:1 and 32%, respectively. The efficiency with 20 μm membrane is better than without membrane. When the volume flow is low, horizontal way is better, but under high volume flow, the efficiency is similar.

84899424299	Response of microbial community to petroleum stress and phosphate dosage in sediments of Jiaozhou Bay, China	The dynamic microcosms were used to evaluate the effect of oil spills on microbial ecological system in marine sediment and the enhancement of nutrient on the oil removal. The function and structure of microbial community caused by the oil pollution and phosphate dosage were simultaneously monitored by dehydrogenase activity assay and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques. The results indicated that the amount of total bacteria in all dynamic microcosms declined rapidly with incubation time. The number of petroleum-degrading bacteria and the activity of sediment dehydrogenase were gradually enhanced by petroleum in the oil-treated microcosms, while they both showed no obvious response to phosphate dosage. In comparison, phosphate spiked heterotrophic bacteria and they showed a significant increase in amount. DGGE profiles indicated that petroleum dosage greatly changed community structure, and the bacteria belonged to class Deltaproteobacteria, and phyla Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi were enriched. This study demonstrated that petroleum input greatly impacted the microbial community structure and consequently the marine sediment petroleum-degrading activity was enhanced. Phosphate dosage would multiply heterotrophic bacteria but not significantly enhance the petroleum degradation. © 2014 Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Bacterial 16S rDNA libraries indicated that proportion of the bacteria in phyla Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria decreased, but that of Gammaproteobacteria and Planctomycetes slightly increased in copper-treated sediment. Denaturing gradient gel profiles showed that bacterial communities in control and copper exposed sediments developed into different directions, while the copper exposure did not change the pattern of ammonia oxidizing bacterial community. Microbial community-level physiological profiling revealed an obvious response to copper dosage. The copper pollution caused an acute decrease of carbon utilizing ability as well as bacterial functional diversity; the number of culturable heterotrophic bacteria was reduced by 90 %. This study demonstrated that high copper input would obviously reduce culturable bacterial counts and seriously impact bacterial community function in marine sediments. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84903946919	The effect of irrigation with oil-polluted water on microbial communities in estuarine reed rhizosphere soils	The effect of long-term drip irrigation with oil-polluted water on microorganisms in reed rhizosphere soils was assessed. During five months of irrigation with oil-polluted water, n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) occurred primarily in topsoils. A petroleum origin was indicated by the predominance of n-alkanes with 13-26 carbons. Naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene and pyrene were the predominant components of the detected PAHs. After five months of irrigation, the oil contaminants decreased the abundances of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes in the reed rhizosphere soils but promoted the growth and reproduction of hydrocarbon degraders. The counts of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi at a depth of 20. cm in soils irrigated with oil-polluted water were only 1/4, 1/10 and 1/2, respectively, of those without oil-polluted water. A Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that ORP, PAHs and n-alkanes had substantial effects on the microbial populations. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles revealed that the structure of the bacterial community was generally less affected, but the dominant flora was changed. Several members of the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes formed a stable, dominant community structure after five months of irrigation with oil-polluted water. The growth and reproduction of certain members of the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were clearly decreased by oil pollution. Oil pollution tended to simplify the functions present in the microorganism communities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 223 samples from different depths were collected at 48 stations. Totally 18 taxa belonging to coccolithophyceae were identified using a polarized microscope at the 1 000× magnification. The maximum species abundance was found at the outside of Transect P. The dominated species were Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Emiliania huxleyi, Helicosphaera carteri, and Algirosphaera robusta. The abundance of coccoliths and cells ranged 0-2 965.73 coccoliths/mL, and 0-119.16 cells/mL, with the average values of 471.00 coccoliths/mL and 23.42 cells/mL, respectively. The LCs in surface layer were mainly observed on the coastal belt and middle part of the survey area. The comparison among Transects A, F, P and E indicated lower species diversity and less abundance in the Yellow Sea than those of the East China Sea. The highest abundance of LCs was found in transect F and P. The coccolith abundance increased slightly from surface to bottom in the water column, but the highest value of the cell abundance was observed in the depth of 10-30 m. Temperature, depth and nutrient concentration were suggested as the major environmental factors controlling the distribution and species composition of LCs in the studying area based on canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). © 2014 The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84906901982	Mathematical modeling for height of absorption region in spray tower for limestone-gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization	Specific surface area and mass transfer rate in spray tower were studied by considering the forces acting on a droplet. Absorption region was divided into accelerating segment and constant speed segment, and a segmentation calculation model for the height of absorption region was developed, which was verified by the data of four industrial desulfurization systems. The effects of operating parameters on the height of absorption region were investigated. The results show that height of absorption region decreases with the decrease of spray density and pH value of absorbent, and increases with the decrease of droplet diameter, superficial gas velocity and inlet SO

84906954903	Preparation and application of carbon nanofibers-supported palladium nanoparticles catalysts based on electrospinning	Carbon nanofibers-supported palladium nanoparticle catalysts were prepared by electrospinning, chemical reduction and the subsequent high temperature carbonization methods. The experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of different reducing agents (sodium borohydride, hydrazine hydrate and hydrogen gas) on morphology of palladium nanoparticles and carbon nanofibers in detail. Catalysts were characterized by UV-Vis spectra, X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectrum, scanning electron microscope, field emission transmission electron microscope. Results show that the palladium nanoparticles are distributed uniformly on the carbon nanofibers with dimension of about 7 nm, and the catalyst is relatively flexible by using hydrogen gas as reducing agent. Then it was applied to the Heck coupling reaction to test catalytic properties and recyclability. Results indicate that the catalyst possesses excellent stability and recyclability.

84920841849	The study of denitrification rate and N2O release rate in Shuangtaizi estuary wetland	The denitrification and its influencing factors were studied in reed, suaeda heteroptera and reed degraded wetland. PDR were similar in reed and suaeda heteroptera wetland; primary influencing factors were temperature, nitrate and TOC. pN<inf>2</inf>O, N<inf>2</inf>O/ (N<inf>2</inf>O + N<inf>2</inf>) were less in reed wetland than that in suaeda heteroptera wetland; significant influencing factor was ORP. Compared with the reed wetland, the PDR in reed degraded wetland had significantly reduced, whose limiting factor was TOC concentration in soil; the ration of N<inf>2</inf>O/ (N<inf>2</inf>O + N<inf>2</inf>) had increased and the pN<inf>2</inf>O had no obvious change in reed degraded wetland.

84924189728	Fabrication of graphene coated carbon fiber microelectrode for highly sensitive detection application	Graphene, as a novel carbon nanomaterial, exhibits superior performance in electrochemical sensors. Here, graphene was applied to the microelectrode system by a simple method. A novel graphene coating carbon fiber microelectrode (G-CFM) was fabricated by electrodepositing graphene on the surface of carbon fiber. The fabrication method is fast and simple. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that carbon fiber was successfully modified by graphene. The electrochemical behavior of G-CFM was characterized by potassium ferricyanide and dopamine (DA). The electrode exhibited much larger current response and less overpotential response, compared to CFM. The microsensor for DA showed good sensitivity and selectivity, and the electrode had good stability. It is believable that the unique characteristic of graphene holds promise for the advanced microelectrode system for highly sensitive detection of various targets. 2014
