9744231430	On-Line Integrated Routing in Dynamic Multifiber IP/WDM Networks	This paper focuses on dynamic integrated routing in multifiber Internet protocol/wavelength-division multiplexing (IP/WDM) networks, which can be implemented through either one-step routing (OSR) or two-step routing (TSR) approach. Based on an extended layered-graph, two resource assignment strategies, termed channel-level balance (CLB) and link-level balance (LLB), are proposed to balance the traffic in the network at different levels. To further improve the performance, a parameter κ, is introduced to make a dynamic tradeoff between the logical-layer links and the optical-layer links. Simulation studies are carried out for various topologies. The results show that LLB is better than CLB in most cases, and LLB combined with OSR has the optimal performance. Also, we find that the routing approach and the resource assignment strategy individually play different roles with different values of r

14744285392	Performance comparison of overlay and peer models in IP/MPLS over optical networks	We study, the connection establishment of label switched paths (LSPs), and compare the LSP blocking performance of the overlay and peer models in IP/MPLS over optical networks. We consider two dynamic routing algorithms for the establishment of LSP connections, of which one is for the overlay model and the other is for the peer model. Our investigations on two typical network topologies, namely NSFNET and ARPA2 networks, show that the number of add/drop ports (or transceivers) on optical cross-connects (OXCs) has a significant impact on the LSP blocking performance for both models. We show by computer simulation that in each case, there is a threshold value for the add/drop ratio, which can achieve almost the best blocking performance. This threshold value remains virtually unchanged as the traffic load varies, but it does depend on the network topology and the number of wave-lengths per fiber. This will then indicate the number of add/drop ports to be used so that one can achieve a near optimal blocking performance without incurring unnecessarily excessive network costs. Our investigations reveal that the peer model achieves a much better blocking performance than the overlay model when the number of add/drop ports is relatively high, but that this is not always true when the number of add/drop ports is small. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

1642565112	Slot Synchronization in Wavelength-Routed Star Networks Based on Broadcasting Frames from a Multi-Frequency Laser	A simple synchronization scheme using broadcasting frames generated from a multi frequency laser (MFL) in a master node was described. The scheme used in-band signalling and so it did not require extra hardware for out-of-band signal processing and delay adjustment. A proof-of concept experiment was carried out to demonstrate synchronous packet switching in a 32 by 32 port AWG. The bit error rate was also measured for data bursts with 2-us length at 10 Gbit/s, and less than 1 dB penalty was observed compared with back measurement.

18944364600	A new routing enhancement scheme based on node blocking state advertisement in wavelength routed WDM networks	The increasing switching capacity brings the optical node with considerable complexity. Due to the limitation in cost and technology, an optical node is often designed with partial switching capability and partial resource sharing. It means that the node is of blocking to some extent, for example multi-granularity switching node, which in fact is a structure using pass wavelength to reduce the dimension of OXC, and partial sharing wavelength converter (WC) OXC. It is conceivable that these blocking nodes will have great effects on the problem of routing and wavelength assignment. Some previous works studied the blocking case, partial WC OXC, using complicated wavelength assignment algorithm. But the complexities of these schemes decide them to be not in practice in real networks. In this paper, we propose a new scheme based on the node blocking state advertisement to reduce the retry or rerouting probability and improve the efficiency of routing in the networks with blocking nodes. In the scheme, node blocking state are advertised to the other nodes in networks, which will be used for subsequent route calculation to find a path with lowest blocking probability. The performance of the scheme is evaluated using discrete event model in 14-node NSFNET, all the nodes of which employ a kind of partial sharing WC OXC structure. In the simulation, a simple First-Fit wavelength assignment algorithm is used. The simulation results demonstrate that the new scheme considerably reduces the retry or rerouting probability in routing process.

18944388617	A low jitter and high throughput scheduling based on genetic algorithm in slotted WDM network	Slotted WDM, which achieves higher capacity compared with conventional WDM and SDH networks, has been discussed a lot recently. The ring network for this architecture has been demonstrated experimentally. In slotted WDM ring network, each node is equipped with a wavelength-tunable transmitter and a fixed receiver and assigned with a specific wavelength. A node can send data to every other node by tuning wavelength accordingly in a time slot. One of the important issues for it is scheduling. Scheduling of it can be reduced to input queued switch when synchronization and propagation are solved and many schemes have been proposed to solve these two issues. However, it's proved that scheduling of such a network taking both jitter and throughput into consideration is NP hard. Greedy algorithm has been proposed to solve it before. The main contribution of this paper lies in a novel genetic algorithm to obtain optimal or near optimal value of this specific NP hard problem. We devise problem specific chromosome codes, fitness function, crossover and mutation operations. Experimental results show that our GA provides better performances in terms of throughput and jitter than a greedy heuristic.

Via explicit interfaces between client network and server network, the client users, including UNI-C and NMS, can create an Optical Layer Connection with three schemes. This may arise the problems such as concurrency due to simultaneously accessing the same resources from UNI and NMI. This paper proposes an approach of a middleware component using CORBA-based product. The middleware component performs to define the ownership and access rules for network resources and prove global network topology and status of the network resources to the client users. It screens the difference between NMI-T, NMI-A and UNI and shields the detail of the ASON network protocols. The standardized IDL interfaces ensure that ASON products from different vendors or employing different technologies can interoperate at the common intermediate plane level and make the implementation of the management functions more simply and efficiently.

The scheduler should satisfy quality of service (QoS) constraints such as throughput and jitter. Solving the scheduling problem for the input-Queued switches can be divided into two steps: Firstly, decomposing the given rate matrix into a sum of permutation matrices with their corresponding weights; secondly, allocating the permutation matrices in one scheduling period based on their weights. It has been proved that scheduling problem in input-Queued switch with throughput and jitter constraints is NP-complete. The main contribution of this paper is a GA based algorithm to solve this NP-complete problem. We devise chromosome codes, fitness function, crossover and mutation operations for this specific problem.

Instead of sharing the complicated information of wavelength converting, it takes the blocking characteristics of each node into consideration in the routing process. To estimate the algorithm, we do the emulation in the 14-nodes national science fund net-work (NSFNET).The result shows that the performance of the blocking probability as well as the probability of setting up failure has been improved greatly and can be improved even greater when the network is in low load.

27844482512	SLEA: A novel scheme for routing in overlay IP/WDM networks	This paper studies the routing problems in Internet protocol/ wavelength-division-multiplexing (IP/WDM) networks based on the overlay routing algorithm (ORA) and the integrated routing algorithm (IRA), respectively. Although IRA usually outperforms ORA in terms of blocking performance, IRA exhibits disadvantages in control information exchange, network privacy issue, and wavelength port efficiency. In this paper, a new mechanism called the short lightpath establislenent approach (SLEA) is proposed for ORA in order to tackle the problems in IRA and achieve similar (or even better) network performance at the same time. The main idea of SLEA is to ensure that each new lightpath created by ORA is restricted by an optical hop constraint when a subwavelength-granularity connection is routed in the optical layer. It follows that SLEA essentially avoids per-connection-based greedy treatment and improves network wide resource utilization by eliminating inefficient long optical bypasses. To implement SLEA in ORA, the Dijsktra's algorithm has been modified based on an extended layered graph model. SLEA does not introduce any additional signaling and;computational complexity. The analysis and simulation in this paper show that there exists an optimal optical hop constraint for each particular network configuration such that SLEA-based ORA (SLEA-ORA) can efficiently utilize the network resource of concern. As a result, with the optimal optical hop constraint, SLEA-ORA could out-perform ORA and IRA in terms of the bandwidth-blocking ratio (BBR) and the average number of IP hops of label-switched paths (LSPs). © 2005 IEEE.

In previous studies, how to share spare resources with SRLG constraints has not been studied in multicast optical networks. In this letter, considering SRLG sharing, we propose a novel algorithm -multicast with SRLG sharing (MSS)- to establish a protection light tree. Finally, the algorithm MSS and the algorithm multicast with no SRLG sharing (MNSS) are compared through a simulation to show that our new sharing scheme of SRLG sharing is more efficient than that of no SRLG sharing in terms of spare resource utilization and blocking probability.

33845603907	A new dynamic routing scheme in optical networks	A good dynamic routing scheme is very important to improve the provisioning efficiency of wavelength-routed optical networks. The existing dynamic routing algorithms are usually based on first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheme to process the lightpath requests one by one. However, multiple lightpath requests may arrive simultaneously and burstly in data-intensive applications, and can not be treated efficiently by using the FCFS scheme. We will propose a new online dynamic routing scheme to process the lightpath requests in batch instead of one by one, which is termed batch-come-batch-serve (BCBS) scheme. A mathematic model and several adaptive routing algorithms are proposed and investigated comparatively. The simulation results suggest that the proposed scheme achieves better network blocking performances.

33845638674	Joint multicasting optical cross-connect employing both space splitters and multi-wavelength converters	As bandwidth-intensive and time-sensitive streams applications such as high-definition television (HDTV) get popular, there rises a demand of supporting multicast communication directly at optical layer on next-generation optical networks. The multicast-capable optical cross-connect (MC-OXCs) is the necessary device to implement multicasting at optical layer. The functional building blocks for MC-OXC are light splitters (space splitters) or multi-wavelength converters (frequency splitters). The space splitter has no wavelength conversion capability, whereas the frequency splitter has limited fanout, decreased optical signal-to-noise ratio and also is expensive. We therefore proposed a tradeoff architecture called joint multicasting capable optical cross-connect (jMC-OXC) integrating both space splitters and multi-wavelength converters. In this paper, we investigate the network performance and the physical transmission performance on the jMC-OXC architecture by dynamic simulation and experimental demonstration. Three simulation schemes are designed and the results show that the network performance of the jMC-OXCs with limited multi-wavelength converters can obtain a close performance to that with full multi-wavelength converters. A prototype of jMC-OXC is examined and its bit error rate (BER) performance is tested after passing the multi-wavelength converters.

33845648411	Stability oriented multicast routing algorithm	Existing multicast models have taken traffic concentration, source-end delay, delay jitter into consideration, while some dynamic application like digital TV delivery poses a new challenge. Users can join/leave multicast group dynamically and arbitrarily. When all users in a service group have left the multicast group, multicast protocols will delete the corresponding delivery edge in the multicast tree, which leads to great control overhead in delivery network. This overhead comes from several aspects, like forwarding tree maintain, update, membership management. Even if the multicast tree is pre-calculated and cannot delete edges in runtime, the users' leaving action can lead to resource utilization problem, especially when the delivery network's bandwidth is expensive. In this paper we designed an algorithm to find the optimized multicast tree to ensure stability of network under dynamic user behavior. With this algorithm, effect of users' random behavior can be smoothed out, thus increase performance of the delivery network.

33845672550	Optimal multicast protection with differentiated leaf availability guarantee in optical mesh networks	Because any link failure on the multicast session may disrupt the signal transmission to several downstream nodes, it is imperative to effectively protect the multicast sessions against link failure. In this paper, we study schemes for establishing primary and backup multicast trees for multicast sessions in a optical mesh network against link failure, e.g., fiber or conduit cut, with taking the different leaf availability requirement and availability guarantee into account. We propose an Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) approach to solve the problem of provisioning survivable multicast sessions with differentiated leaf availability guaranteed. Different from the previous schemes, our scheme finds out the complete (the tree spans the root and all the leaf nodes) primary and complete or incomplete (the tree spans the root and part of the leaf nodes) backup trees for multicast sessions guarantees the availability requirement. Because of taking the different leaf availability requirements into account, the proposed algorithm finds out more efficient feasible solution requiring less network resources, and even find a feasible solution where the previous algorithms fail.

33750985952	Impairment constraint multicasting in translucent WDM networks: Architecture, network design and multicasting routing	The popularity of broadband streaming applications requires communication networks to support high-performance multicasting at the optical layer. Suffering from transmission impairments in multi-hop all-optical (transparent) WDM multicasting networks, the signal may be degraded beyond the receivable margin at some multicast destinations. To guarantee the signal quality, we introduce a translucent WDM multicasting network to regenerate the degraded signals at some switching nodes with electronic 3R (reamplification, reshaping and retiming) functionality. The translucent network is built by employing three kinds of multicasting capable switching architectures: (1) all-optical multicasting capable cross connect (oMC-OXC), (2) electronic switch and (3) translucent multicasting capable cross connect (tMC-OXC). Among them both the electronic switch and tMC-OXC are capable of electronic 3R regeneration. Furthermore, we propose a multicast-capable nodes placement algorithm based on regeneration weight, and two multicasting routing algorithms called nearest hub first and nearest on tree hub first to provide signal-quality guaranteed routes for the multicasting requests. The numerical simulation on two typical mesh networks shows that it is sufficient to equip 30% of the nodes or less with signal-regeneration capability to guarantee the signal quality. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

Optical multicasting outperforms the electronic multicasting in some aspects. Service level agreement (SLA) and quality of service (QoS) are important to service providers and users. Service providers always first maximize revenue to accept as many as connection requests as possible and then to minimize the capacity of all accepted connection.

We propose a mixed integer linear program (MILP) based approach for static multicast traffic. The feature of our algorithm lies on without considering any protection schemes, and when the system adapts dedicated protection or the sharing protection, the problem is more complicated.

33645010324	Multicast protection with differentiated leaf availability requirements in WDM mesh networks	Multicast protection strategies have been widely explored in current literature. However, the leaf availability requirements are not taken into account. In this paper, we investigated approaches and algorithms for establishing a multicast session with differentiated leaf availability requirements in WDM mesh network while protecting it against single link failure. An efficient and cost-effective heuristic is presented to solve the problem and is compared with two other schemes, one with no protection (Scheme I) and the other with dedicated protection (Scheme II). We also formulated a possible improvement of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results based on 14 node NSFNET topology and comparisons among these schemes are also discussed. The performance of an algorithm is measured in terms of Average Cost and Average Satisfaction Ratio. The improved algorithm shows much better performance than the other ones, thus achieving the goal of effectively establishing protected multicast sessions with differentiated destination availability requirements. Finally, through numerical simulation results, we find that some links are critical to the performance of the network. Increasing the availability and capacity of these links will greatly enhance the network performance. This result is helpful to network planning and design.

42549121242	Evaluation of delay performance in valiant load-balancing network	Network traffic grows in an unpredictable way, which forces network operators to over-provision their backbone network in order to meet the increasing demands. In the consideration of new users, applications and unexpected failures, the utilization is typically below 30% [1]. There are two methods aimed to solve this problem. The first one is to adjust link capacity with the variation of traffic. However in optical network, rapid signaling scheme and large buffer is required. The second method is to use the statistical multiplexing function of IP routers connected point-to-point by optical links to counteract the effect brought by traffic's variation [2]. But the routing mechanism would be much more complex, and introduce more overheads into backbone network. To exert the potential of network and reduce its overhead, the use of Valiant Load-balancing for backbone network has been proposed in order to enhance the utilization of the network and to simplify the routing process. Raising the network utilization and improving throughput would inevitably influence the end-to-end delay. However, the study on delays of Load-balancing is lack. In the work presented in this paper, we study the delay performance in Valiant Load-balancing network, and isolate the queuing delay for modeling and detail analysis. We design the architecture of a switch with the ability of load-balancing for our simulation and experiment, and analyze the relationship between switch architecture and delay performance.

42549131008	On QoS guarantee in MPLS network with software deadline awareness	With the increasing number of internet users, more and more real-time services are added into the network, such as IPTV, online-video, Voice over IP, etc. As we know, throughput is a highly important performance criterion for scheduling algorithms of networks. Besides throughput, these growing real-time services are very sensitive to delay variance termed as jitter. Therefore, high performance scheduling algorithm should achieve good performance in terms of throughput, delay, jitter and fairness together. Scheduling algorithm with deadline-awareness employed in packet switching plays a key role in QoS guarantees. Although traditional hard-deadline can provide guarantee on in-node delay-deadline criteria, the end-to-end delay-deadline criteria cannot be guaranteed due to the characteristic of hard-deadline, while the delay-deadline guaranteed throughput is low. Thus, soft-deadline scheduling algorithm has been proposed. In this paper, we investigate and compare the classical hard-deadline and soft-deadline switching algorithm. A new scheme "Bonus System" is proposed in order to realize the idea of soft-deadline switching algorithm. Bonus System based on soft-deadline is compared with classical Early-Deadline First scheme based on hard-deadline, which shows that Bonus System has better performance in End-to-End deadline guarantee.

42549134581	A novel scheme of SONET/SDH label assignment in GMPLS-controlled MSTN network	Because SONET/SDH technology which includes contiguous concatenation and virtual concatenation is used in GMPLS-Controlled Multi-services Transport Platform (MSTP) Network, it is more complex when we consider the label assignment when setting up a Label Switch Path (LSP). It is very imperative to use a method which could use the limited labels effectively. In this paper, we study the structure of the label space and different label algorithm to allocate SONET/SDH labels, which include virtual concatenation labels and contiguous concatenation labels in GMPLS-Controlled MSTP Network. We proposed a minimum Contiguous Labels Algorithm (min-CLA) to solve the problem of using the limited label space on each interface at the most degree. Different from the previous schemes worked on Route Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in the Wavelength-Division- Multiplex (WDM) networks, our scheme finds out the primary and easy method based on SONET/SDH label which has virtual concatenation labels and contiguous concatenation labels used for different kinds of needs. Because of taking the multiple services requirements into account, the proposed algorithm finds out more efficient feasible solution requiring less network resources and even find a feasible solution which will enable some label assignment failed in other label assignment algorithm and we will compare our scheme and the Fist Fit Scheme.

42549142205	Low jitter scheduling with redundancy control for input-queued switches	In switch scheduling, jitter becomes an important performance criterion for increasing real-time applications. Low Jitter Decomposition (LJS) was proposed in the frame-based scheduling switches [9]. However, we notice that in LJS, the bandwidth requirement of schedule tables is greater than the actual amount of traffic. The redundant bandwidth requirement not only wastes the resource of switch, but also introduces an extra jitter. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to reduce the extra jitter caused by redundancy: Integer Average Redundancy Control (IARC) and Dichotomy Sequence Redundancy Control (DSRC). We demonstrate that the jitter bound of the two algorithms is lower than that of the scheme without redundancy control. Simulation experiments show that DSRC and IARC can reduce nearly 50% jitter of the scheme without redundancy control at medium switch load. We also show that DSRC has a low complexity (O(1) for each input-output pair) which is important for high-speed switches.

42549153422	IP over optical multicasting for large-scale video delivery	In the IPTV systems, multicasting will play a crucial role in the delivery of high-quality video services, which can significantly improve bandwidth efficiency. However, the scalability and the signal quality of current IPTV can barely compete with the existing broadcast digital TV systems since it is difficult to implement large-scale multicasting with end-to-end guaranteed quality of service (QoS) in packet-switched IP network. China 3TNet project aimed to build a high performance broadband trial network to support large-scale concurrent streaming media and interactive multimedia services. The innovative idea of 3TNet is that an automatic switched optical networks (ASON) with the capability of dynamic point-to-multipoint (P2MP) connections replaces the conventional IP multicasting network in the transport core, while the edge remains an IP multicasting network. In this paper, we will introduce the network architecture and discuss challenges in such IP over Optical multicasting for video delivery.

42549163410	Dynamic routing algorithm for large file transport in optical network	Many distributed computing applications need transfer large files between distributed locations as fast as possible. A dynamic routing algorithm for optical network is designed to modify existing transfers and spare network resources for new request to satisfy both old and new transfers' requirements. In data intensive application on circuit-switch optical network, light-path resources are scarce and there should be concurrent file transfers competing for the same fibers. In static routing optical network, if new coming file transfer cannot acquire light-path with enough bandwidth, it could only wait for the releasing of current used resources. Due to the waiting, the delay time will be large. So we use our dynamic routing algorithm to schedule and modify existing light-paths, to spare a light-path with enough bandwidth for new coming file. Our optimized target is to make every file finish transferring in less time, so we propose two objectives defined in the paper: one is to make maximal delay time of all tasks less and the other is to make average delay time less. The algorithm proposed has two mainly steps: 1) Routing process; 2) Dynamic routing process. In routing step, when task of file arrives we firstly get k random paths, then use Least Congestion Algorithm (LCA) (or Shortest Path Algorithm (SPA)) to get the primary path Pl of maximal residual bandwidth (RB) from k paths and the alternate path P2 of the second maximal RB. If the bandwidth of Pl is enough for this task, transfer the file in Pl path. If not, we go to the dynamic routing process. In the second process, get all the links of Pl then we change the existing light paths of tasks in the Pl path one by one to their alternative paths until we can get enough bandwidth of Pl. In the dynamic routing process, we design two different queuing strategies. The first strategy is First Arrive First Modified (FAFM) strategy, namely we schedule the first arrival task firstly. The other is Larger Bandwidth First Modified (LBFM) and the file with larger bandwidth is scheduled firstly. By comparison of simulation results, we can prove that our two kinds of dynamic routing algorithms can get better results for both decreasing maximal delay time and average delay time than LCA and SPA routing algorithms. In the two queuing strategies, LBFM can get better results than FAFM strategy. The receivers in the destinations can get better results by using our dynamic routing algorithm.

42549171151	Time-path routing and scheduling optimization algorithm based on max-flow theoretic	In this paper we proposed a Max-Flow Oriented Algorithm (MFOA) to achieve the shortest finish time in Time-Path Scheduling Problem (TPSP). The signification of our algorithm is that it combines both benefits of the Max-Flow algorithm and heuristic algorithms, so we can achieve a better result with lower time cost. Another feature of our algorithm is that all the data on the same node in the network can be considered as a single merged data, so the time cost is mainly depended on the network topology and the task numbers will not affect the time cost much. This feature makes our algorithm suitable for large scale applications. In this paper we figured out the relationship of Max-Flow routing and our objective: shortest finish time, and how the Max-Flow theoretic helps to achieve it. We also build the mathematical model of our MFOA with Max-Flow Oriented Scheduling (MFOS) rerouting strategy. To investigate the performance of our algorithm, we compare it with existing optimization algorithm and algorithms with 4 other heuristic rerouting strategies. Based on the results of simulations on different topologies, our algorithm is best in most of the situations. Besides the method used in this paper also helps to develop more efficient algorithms.

43949095155	Optimized designs of p-cycles for survivable multicast sessions in optical WDM networks	Network service outage causes tremendous revenue loss and service disruption for both unicast and multicast traffic. In particular, multicast trafile suffers more in network failures than unicast traffic does, because a link in a multicast tree might carry traffic to multiple destinations. Hence, network survivability is crucial to provisioning of multicast sessions in optical WDM networks. The preconfigured protection cycle (p-cyde) method, originally proposed for unicast traffic protection [1] by W. D. Grover, combines the rings' simplicity, fast speed in switching, and the meshes' flexibility in routing, efficiency in resource utilization. Although p-cycles have been extensively studied for unicast traffic protection, they have been rarely applied to multicast traffic protection. We have recently proposed applying link p-cycle based approaches, namely Dynamic p-Cycle (DpC) design and link p cycle based Protected Working Capacity Envelope (PWCE) design to dynamic provisioning of survivable multicast traffic [2]. In this paper, we analyze the existing multicast protection approaches and present Integer Linear Programming (ILP) methods for p-cyde based protection of static multicast sessions. We consider the approaches of p-cycle based ILP joint optimization (JOP) and Non-joint optimization (NJOP), and the approach of p-cycle based ILP optimization of spare capacity (SOP). These ILP optimization methods serve as the bench mark for p cycle based heuristic algorithms [3]. We also compare the results with that of the Path Pair Protection approach in [4]. We show that the p-cyde based JOP offers the least total capacity consumption, compared with other optimization approaches.

44449153063	A cross-layer optical circuit provisioning framework for data intensive IP end hosts	Using circuit-switched optical networks for next generation e-science applications is gaining increasing interest. In such applications, circuits are provisioned for end hosts to accomplish data-intensive or QoS-stringent communication tasks. Existing provisioning methods provide point-to-point connectivity for end hosts, that is, an established circuit connects one end host to another, and during the lifetime of the circuit, only communication tasks between the connected end hosts can be served. This inhibits circuits from being used in more general cases, where each end host communicates with different remote parities simultaneously through a single network interface. We propose V-STONES - a data flow-based VLAN tagging and switching technique to increase the connectivity of end host network interfaces in circuit-switched networks. With V-STONES, not only can an IP end host communicate with different remote systems concurrently through bandwidth guaranteed connections, but also protocol entities at different stack layers can talk to their counterparts through dedicated bandwidth pipes. In this article, we review the existing circuit provisioning methods and then discuss V-STONES and the architecture of cross-layer circuit provisioning for end hosts. We also introduce a prototype implementation in an optical network testbed and present the experimental results. © 2008 IEEE.

47649092534	Dichotomy slot allocation: A low-jitter scheduling scheme for input-queued switches	Recently, jitter is becoming an important performance criterion in switch scheduling to accommodate many emerging real-time applications. Formerly proposed low-jitter scheduling algorithms decompose traffic demands into a weighted sum of permutation matrices and then schedule these decomposed permutation matrices. However, a port pair's appearance in these decomposed matrices may exceed their actual traffic demand. Such extra allocation may result in high jitter for a port pair. In order to smoothly schedule each port pair, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm termed as Dichotomy Slot Allocation (DSA). To achieve low jitter and small cell loss, DSA allocates slots to port pairs based on a designed Dichotomy Order. Both analysis and simulation results demonstrate that DSA achieves relatively lower jitter as compared to the state of the art. ©2007 IEEE.

50449086784	Joint scheduling of computation and network resource in optical grid	Although there are some researches have been done on the testbeds or architectures for optical grid applications, few efforts have been made on the scheduling problem for the optical grid application in theoretical details. When optical networks are considered as resources and jointly scheduled with other grid resources, communication contention must be taken into consideration for efficient task scheduling. This paper analyzes two schemes for reducing the communication contention in joint scheduling of computation and network resources for optical grid, one is the adaptive routing scheme and the other is grid resource selection scheme. The adaptive routing scheme, that was proposed in another paper [16] can detour the heavy traffic and find an earliest start route for each edge scheduling. A multilevel method for grid resource selection scheme is proposed in this paper, which help to schedule tasks onto the nearby resources, leading to a reduction in the average data transferred across individual links. Simulation results show that when we employ the two schemes together in the joint scheduling model, most of the communication contention can be removed, producing the smallest schedule length with relatively lower link utilization. ©2007 IEEE.

50649114928	Fault-tolerant policy for optical network based distributed computing system	The optical network based distributed computing system has been thought as a promising technology to support large-scale data-intensive distributed applications. For such a system with so many heterogeneous resources and middlewares involved, faults seem to be inevitable. However, for those applications that need to be finished before the given deadline, a fault in the system will lead to the failure of the application. Therefore, fault-tolerant policy is necessary to improve the performance of the system when faults could happen. In this paper, we address to the fault-tolerant problem for the optical network based distributed computing system. We first propose an overlay approach which applies the existing fault-tolerant policies for distributed computing and optical network. Then we present a joint fault-tolerant policy which takes into account the fault tolerance for computing resource and network resource in the same time. We compare the performances of different polices by simulation. The simulation results show that the joint fault-tolerant policy achieves much better performances compared to overlay approaches. © 2008 IEEE.

51149094580	On the stability of multicast flow aggregation in IP over optical network for IPTV delivery	The stable multicast flow aggregation (MFA) problem in internet protocol (IP) over optical network under the dynamical scenario is studied. Given an optical network topology, there is a set of head ends and access routers attached to the optical network, in which each head end can provide a set of programs (IP multicasting flows) and each access router requests a set of programs, we find a set of stable light-trees to accommodate the optimally aggregated multicast IP flows if the requests of access routers changed dynamically. We introduce a program correlation matrix to describe the preference of end users' requests. As the original MFA problem is NP-complete, a heuristic approach, named most correlated program first (MCPF), is presented and compared with the extended least tree first (ELTF) algorithm which is topology aware. Simulation results show that MCPF can achieve better performance than ELTF in terms of stability with negligible increment of network resource usage.

51149101573	Multicast flow aggregation in IP over optical networks	It is widely believed that IP over optical networks will be a major component of the next generation Internet However, it is not efficient to map a single multicast IP flow into one light-tree, since the bandwidth of an IP flow required is usually much less than that of a light-tree. In this paper, we study the problem of multicast flow aggregation (MFA) in the IP over optical two-layered networks under the overlay model, which can be defined as follows: given a set of head ends (i.e. optical multicasting sources), each of which can provide a set of contents (i.e. multicast IP flows) with different required transmission bandwidth, and a set of requested content at the access routers (i.e. optical multicasting destinations), find a set of light-trees as well as the optimal aggregation of multicast IP flows in each light-tree. We model MFA by a tri-partite graph with multiple criteria and show that the problem is NP-complete. Optimal solutions are designed by exploiting MFA to formulate an integer linear programming (ILP), with two parameters: the multicast receiving index alpha and the redundant transmitting index beta. We also propose a heuristic algorithm. Finally, we compare the performance of MFA for different combination of alpha and beta via experiments and show our heuristic algorithm is effective for large-scale network in numerical results © 2006 IEEE.

51249106280	Per-flow re-sequencing in load-balanced switches by using dynamic mailbox sharing	Load-balanced switches have received much attention because they are more scalable than other switch architectures. However, a load-balanced switch has the problem of packet missequencing. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Mailbox Sharing (DMS) scheme to eliminate the mis-sequencing problem of load-balanced switches only at the cost of a very small increase of delay. The key idea is to keep packets of the same flow in order in the load-balanced switch. The DMS scheme is based on two statistical facts in operational networks: the number of simultaneous active flows in the router buffer is far less than that of in-progress flows, and most of the intra-flow packet intervals are longer than the packet delay in the high speed router. In DMS, the packet sequence of the same flow arrived in the input ports is recorded in the mailbox maintained in the output ports. Then, packets of the same flow are delivered according to the order of their arrivals. The mailbox becomes the bottleneck in order to accommodate a large number of flows. We thus propose a dynamic sharing scheme to alleviate the bottleneck and greatly enhance the scalability of the mailbox. By simulations using the real internet traffic traces, we show that with a simple flow splitter mechanism restraining mis-sequencing, the average packet delay using DMS is considerably lower than that of other schemes including Uniform Frame Spreading, Padded Frame and the CR switch, and it is close to the ideal case without resequencing even when the load is very high. The results also demonstrate that the size of mailbox is in the hundreds. ©2008 IEEE.

52349111127	Fairness of sharing protection for multicast in WDM networks	In this paper, the sharing schemes of multicast in survivable Wavelength-Division Multiplexed (WDM) networks are studied and the concept of Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) is considered. While the network resources are shared by the backup paths, the sharing way is possible to make the backup paths selfish. This selfishness leads the redundant hops of the backup route and a large number of primary lightpaths to share one backup link. The sharing schemes, especially, the self-sharing and cross-sharing, are investigated to avoid the selfishness when computing the backup light-tree. In order to decrease the selfishness of the backup paths, it is important to make the sharing links fair to be used. There is a trade-off between the self-sharing and cross-sharing, which is adjusted through simulation to adapt the sharing degree of each sharing scheme and save the network resources. © 2008 Science Press, Institute of Electronics, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

55749111727	Task scheduling considering fault probability for distributed computing applications over an optical network	The optical network integrated computing environment has been thought of as a promising technology to support large-scale data-intensive distributed computing applications. For such an environment involving so many heterogeneous resources, such as high-performance processors and optical links, faults seem to be inevitable. The faults will lead to the failure of the applications or highly delay the applications' finish times. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze resources' fault probability and then to better schedule the tasks of the application onto the appropriate resources so as to minimize the fault probability of the application. We address the task-scheduling problem based on the fault probability analysis for distributed computing applications over an optical network. We quantitatively analyze the fault probability of the processors and optical links in a given interval and propose a minimal fault probability (MFP) task-scheduling algorithm to minimize the fault probability of the application. We develop a simulator to evaluate the performance of the MFP algorithm. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the MFP algorithm. © 2008 Optical Society of America.

Based on the comparison of their reliability and real-time performance, a mesh optical switching network topology with 256 nodes is chosen. The redundancy topology gives the ability to sustain 3 link faults, which assures the reliability of network. The seriousness of the network failure can be measured by the number of link faults. And when several link faults occur at the same time, it must also be measured by the contiguity degree among the faults. A simulation is taken to test the end-to-end latency under all network failure situations. The simulation results show that even when some serious fault occurs, the number of hops of the end-to-end route increases slightly. So it still meets the real-time communication requirements.

Scheduling such data-intensive applications includes assigning tasks on computational resources, routing lightpaths, and assigning wavelength channels for data communication. The scheduling problem is NP-hard in the traditional grid system, and in optical grids, it is more complicated due to the character of optical networks. In this paper, we formulate the scheduling problem in optical grids and propose a novel scheduling algorithm which modifies the scheduling order according to actual importance of each task to search for a better solution. We call it the scheduled critical path (SCP) algorithm. We compare the scheduling results obtained by the SCP algorithm with the optimal results calculated by OPL studio software on a 3-node optical grid. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on more complicated systems, we construct a simulator which is able to schedule the application to the optical grid according to a certain scheduling algorithm.

67349215713	Task scheduling accuracy analysis in optical grid environments	Currently optical networks have been employed to meet the ever-increasing data transfer demands of grid applications and thus give rise to the concept of an "optical grid". Task scheduling is an important issue for an optical grid, for it optimally allocates both grid and optical network resources to accelerate application execution and increase the resource utilization ratio. However, most task scheduling algorithms based on theoretical models may generate accuracy deviations between the scheduled results and the actual finish time of the applications. Accuracy deviations may lead to inefficient resources utilization and unsatisfied Quality of Service (QoS). This paper aims to improve the accuracy of task scheduling algorithms in optical grid environments. We first propose the theoretical task scheduling algorithm and demonstrate that the scheduling result is deviated with actual finish time in the real optical grid environment. Then, we reveal several factors which are likely to influence scheduling accuracy and develop a realistic task scheduling algorithm. We evaluate the theoretical and realistic task scheduling algorithms in our optical grid testbed.

In optical grid, the faults of both computational and network resources are inevitable due to the large scale and high complexity of the system. With the optical network based distributed computing systems extensive applied in the processing of data, the requirement of the application failure probability have been an important indicator of the quality of application and an important aspect the operators consider. This paper will present a task-based analysis method of the application failure probability in optical grid. Then the failure probability of the entire application can be quantified, and the performance of reducing application failure probability in different backup strategies can be compared, so that the different requirements of different clients can be satisfied according to the application failure probability respectively. In optical grid, when the application based DAG (directed acyclic graph) is executed in different backup strategies, the application failure probability and the application complete time is different. This paper will propose new multi-objective differentiated services algorithm (MDSA). New application scheduling algorithm can guarantee the requirement of the failure probability and improve the network resource utilization, realize a compromise between the network operator and the application submission.

Among them, SPN has the highest sharing efficiency but at the expense of a complex switch fabric. In this paper, we investigate the Clos-type SPN and SPL structures and propose a novel structure, which is termed as C-SPW, to share fixed WCs based on the Clos network. The comparative simulations show that the sharing of fixed WCs in C-SPW can achieve similar drop probability (DP) with the sharing of tunable ones in Clos-type SPN under synchronous uniform traffic. The reason is that the fixed WCs in C-SPW can be accessible by all incoming packets, instead of a subset of them. Furthermore, an analytical model is derived to calculate the DP and converter utilization rate when C-SPW is operated in a synchronous mode under uniform traffic. The proposed analytical model fits well with the simulation results. © 2009 IEEE.

The applicability of this mechanism is examined under overlay emulation environment, which is supported by the performance data collected from a real enterprise overlay network. © 2009 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

73849101085	Overlay of multicast service in WDM-PON based on dynamic wavelength reflection scheme	We propose a novel scheme to overlay multicast service over a wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) passive optical network (PON) based on dynamic wavelength reflection scheme. At the optical line terminal (OLT), for each WDM channel, a dynamic wavelength reflector is used to selectively bypass the corresponding optical carrier to avoid multicast data superimposition, while the remaining optical carriers go through the dynamic wavelength reflector and simultaneously carry the multicast data. The proposed scheme is experimentally demonstrated with 5-Gb/s downstream unicast, multicast data and 625-Mb/s upstream re-modulated data. © 2009 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

73849143955	Deflection routing in multi-channel photonic network on chip architecture	Ultralow-latency and less power consumption have become necessary in multi-processor interconnection network on chip, photonic interconnection as a solution to meet above requirement, provides high performance interconnection on chip. But the photonic network on chip architecture design and performance is limited because photonic interconnection hasn't buffer, photonic network architecture must be designed to relieve this limitation. In this paper, we present a multi-channel photonic network on chip architecture employing deflection routing, optical data packets can inject/eject from processor core by four channels at the same time. Simulation result shows this network architecture has 60% latency decrease compared to generic photonic network on chip, and the photonic network architecture is only consume 7% power of the electronic interconnection network on chip with the same scale. © 2009 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

73849151052	Allocation of wavelength selective and convertible cross connects in optical multicast networks	To support multicast in the optical layer, a wavelength cross connect node need to be equipped with light splitters. Wavelength conversion can improve the fiber link utilization and reduce the blocking probability for both unicast and multicast traffic. However, it is of high complexity to integrate light splitters and wavelength converters in a single node. This paper investigates a new resource allocation strategy in optical multicast network: a subset of optical nodes are multicast-capable, while the other nodes are wavelength convertible. The optimal configuration of the wavelength crossconnect nodes is investigated to produce the minimal blocking probability for dynamic multicast traffic. © 2009 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

77949619680	Throughput performance of d-tree multicast capable optical cross-connect under synchronous traffic	This paper investigates the throughput performance of the d-tree multicast capable optical cross-connect (MC-OXC) by using the separated unicast/multicast splitter-and-delivery (SUM-SaD) switches under synchronous traffic. A d-tree property is introduced to constrain the ability that the MC-OXC and SUM-SaD can accommodate the numbers of light trees. We propose the maximal independent set (MIS) model of the conflict graph to establish as most sessions as possible. It needs to find the d-constrained MIS (d-MIS) of multicast conflict graph and the MIS of the remained unicast conflict graph to maximize the throughput under the assumption that the multicast sessions have higher priority than the unicast ones. The MIS problem of the conflict graph is NP-complete, and two heuristic conflict-based algorithms: Minimal Conflict First (MCF) and First See First Service (FSFS) are proposed to find the MIS of the conflict graph. The Minimal Member First (MMF) and Maximal Member First (MAMF) algorithms are applied to determine the d-MIS of multicast conflict graph uniquely. Simulation results show that the d-tree MC-OXC at d ≥ 2 achieves favorable throughput performance. When the wavelength resource on each fiber link is scarce, the performances of the four conflict-based MIS algorithms are different and behave in the order of MCF, MMF, FSFS and MAMF from best to worst. ©2009 IEEE.

77949621227	An insertion loss balance aware routing scheme in photonic network on chip	The paper presents a novel energy efficient routing scheme for photonic network on chip (PNoC) based on the micro-resonator which takes the insertion loss and the path-setup latency into consideration in order to design a high performance per watt multi-processors. The path-setup latency is a major contributor to the whole system's latency that has something to do with queuing. And insertion loss which has impact on power consumption is closely related to the number of micro-resonators in on state. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, we design a straight line first heuristic routing scheme. The goal of this routing scheme is to reduce the path-setup latency and insertion loss. Simulation results show that this scheme can low the latency with lower the insertion loss as little as possible. ©2009 IEEE.

The advertising trigger rate of individual abstract link is taken as the metric of efficiency. We present an analytical model that reveals the contributions of different physical links to the advertising trigger rate of individual abstract links. According to the model, we propose a state based advertising mechanism, called partial link based advertising (PLA) which can discern and advertise the state variation of individual abstract link by monitoring only a portion of physical links. We formulate the problem of how to optimally selecting physical links to monitor, and provide a heuristic algorithm for link selection. Results show that the PLA performs more efficiently than existing mechanisms in terms of advertising trigger rate and blocking probability.

77951091644	Dichotomy slot allocation: A QoS guaranteed scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches	With the rapid increase of real-time applications, jitter, delay, and throughput have become the three important QoS criteria in the scheduling of input-queued (IQ) switches with virtual output queues (VOQ). In this paper, we propose a novel frame-based scheduling algorithm, referred to as dichotomy slot allocation (DSA), to achieve high throughput, bounded delay, and bounded jitter. DSA possesses three major characteristics. First, DSA schedules the switch on a per-VOQ basis, and strives to provision QoS guarantees for each traffic stream corresponding to each VOQ. Second, DSA allocates the exact amount of slots to schedule the actual traffic of each VOQ, and decides the time slot for each packet. Third, DSA equally allocates the slots in a frame to each port pair, and then adjusts the scheduling to meet the actual traffic demand. The adjustment process employs a specially designed order named Dichotomy Order to guarantee QoS. Both analysis and simulation results demonstrate that DSA achieves good performance in jitter and throughput. © 2010 IEEE.

We presented the performance analysis on finite duration multi-channel delivery method in our previous work, when channel changes are sequential and adjacent. In this paper, we develop mathematical models to evaluate the performance of this method when channel change happens randomly. This in fact generalizes the previous model. We find that, in typical setup, a delivery duration of 20 seconds is enough to reduce the channel change time by 47.5%, yet the peak bandwidth increase on carrier's uplink is 66.7%. This indicates that the finite duration multi-channel delivery method can improve viewers' experience effectively when channel changes are random. ©2010 IEEE.

In the line-defect waveguides, the transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization lights are guided using photonic band-gap and total internal reflection effect, respectively. The light at the resonant frequency for TE polarization can be transferred from one waveguide to the other using the proposed system.

For such a system involving many heterogeneous computing and network resources, faults seem to be inevitable. Therefore, a fault-tolerant DAG scheduling scheme is necessary to improve the performance of the optical grid system. However, existing joint task scheduling schemes for real-time DAG applications generally do not consider the availability issues when making scheduling decisions. We develop an availability-driven scheduling scheme that improves the DAG availability iteratively by allocating two copies of one communication task to two disjoint lightpaths for data transfer while satisfying application deadline requirements. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed scheduling scheme. © 2010 OSA.

Providing differentiated protection services to connections for surviving link failure has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the differentiated protection services for workflow-based applications, which consist of many interdependent tasks, have scarcely been studied. This paper investigates the problem of providing differentiated services for workflow-based applications in optical grid. In this paper, we develop three differentiated protection services provisioning strategies which can provide security level guarantee and network-resource optimization for workflow-based applications. The simulation demonstrates that these heuristic algorithms provide protection cost-effectively while satisfying the applications' failure probability requirements. © 2011 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

However previous research efforts were static approaches, which are difficult to implement in multidomain optical networks, especially in public carriers' networks with lots of dynamic background traffic. In this article we put forward that optical network virtualization can be a possible solution to the above mentioned problems. We analyze the benefits and challenges of joint scheduling over a virtualized optical network (VON) across multiple domains and discuss the impacts of dedicated and shared VON provisioning on scheduling problems. Then we propose a VON service composition framework for grid applications, which is different from traditional interdomain routing protocol.

The SMRW is created on the surface of a circular photonic crystal (CPC) structure, where the wave propagates with high transmission efficiency. As a fundamental mode is introduced in the input SMW, at certain frequencies, the SMRW modes are enhanced because of resonance and the light-waves are coupled to the output SMW. It is demonstrated by the simulation results that the surface mode ring resonator has a low radiation loss with a very small size because of the good wave-guiding of surface mode based on PCs, and can be used in the future wavelength division multiplex (WDM) optics communication systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

83255165566	Combining sFlow and tracker traffic analysis: A novel estimation approach for network-wide BitTorrent distribution	BitTorrent(BT) has emerged as one of the most popular protocols for content sharing in recent years. Most BT applications are network-oblivious which brings great challenges to traffic engineering. As basic input information, network-wide BT traffic distribution is of vital importance for service providers (SP) or carriers to enforce appropriate control policies. Direct online measurement of network-wide BT traffic faces scalability issue, for it requires deploying application identification deep packet inspection (DPI) device on every subject link. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate network-wide BT traffic distribution through combining sFlow and Tracker traffic analysis. Owing to a noticeable increase of BT traffic using random port numbers, sFlow alone is no longer sufficient for BT recognition. We tackle this problem by combining sFlow with information collected from BT tracker's traffic. With assistance of this information, BT samples can be accurately distinguished from other sFlow samples. The efficacy of our approach is evaluated through experiments on backbone links of campus network. Evaluation results show that our approach can reach a high accuracy in network-wide BT traffic estimation. © 2011 IEEE.

Live migration of virtual machine across different hosts has been a powerful tool to facilitate system maintenance, load balancing, fault tolerance and so on. In this paper, we use a measurement-based approach to compare the performance of two major live migration technologies under certain network conditions, i.e., VMotion and XenMotion. The results show that VMotion generates much less data transferred than XenMotion when migrating identical VMs. However, in network with moderate packet loss and delay, which are typical in a VPN (virtual private network) scenario used to connect the data centers, XenMotion outperforms VMotion in total migration time. We hope that this study can be helpful in choosing suitable virtualization environments for data center administrators and optimizing existing live migration mechanisms. © 2011 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

84860635806	Low power consumption routing and spectrum allocation in optical OFDM networks	We investigated the power consumption of the Bandwidth-Variable Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (BV-OOFDM) transport networks. OFDM has been recently proposed as a modulation technique for optical networks due to its good spectral efficiency enabling elastic bandwidth transmissions compared with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). So far, the vast majority of research papers on Routing and Spectrum Allocation (RSA) problem in optical OFDM focus on increasing spectrum efficiency, however power consumption rather than spectral efficiency may eventually become a barrier to the continued growth of the Internet. In this paper, we introduce RSA problem from the viewpoint of network power consumption, which we formulate as Low Power Consumption RSA (LPC-RSA) problem. Different algorithms to solve the LPC-RSA problem are present. We start by presenting an optimal integer linear programming (ILP) RSA algorithm using decomposition method which breaks RSA into its two substituent subproblems, namely, (i) routing and (ii) spectrum allocation and solves them sequentially. For large networks, a heuristic algorithm is also proposed. Our results indicate that RSA with optimal objective of power consumption can have better power consumption and the same spectral efficiency solution compared with RSA with optimal objective of spectral efficiency, and the proposed heuristic algorithm yields close to the optimal solution in low running time. © 2011 IEEE.

We aim to build a scalable platform, named Analysis Farm, for analyzing network logs. Analysis Farm's targets include fast log aggregation and agile log query. To achieve these goals, storage scalability, computation scalability and query agility should be addressed.

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows. © 2012 IEEE.

Due to varying Round-Trip Time (RTT) and grant window sizes, the transmission order of ONUs will greatly affect the mean packet delay. In this paper, we address this grant scheduling problem aiming at minimizing the mean packet delay.

84874583027	Making high-speed OQ switches with QoS guarantees practical	A store-and-forward packet switched network consists of switches or routers (nodes) and the links connecting them as shared resources. Ideally, network switches employ output queueing. When a packet arrives at an output-queued (OQ) switch, it is immediately placed in a queue that is dedicated to its output link. Separating switching from scheduling makes it easier to design scheduling algorithms to achieve performance guarantees. Many packet scheduling algorithms for OQ switches have been proposed and shown capable of providing QoS guarantees. Output queueing, however, has been considered either impossible or impractical for high-speed networks, because it requires the switching fabric and memory to run N times as fast as the line rate. Memory with bandwidth sufficient for implementing a high-speed OQ switch with a large number of ports simply does not exist. In practice, input-queued (IQ) switches and combined input and output queued (CIOQ) switches are used. In this paper, we present an innovative framework for implementing a class of high-speed OQ switches with QoS guarantees. Internal speedup is implemented by memory interleaving, and O(1)-time scheduling is realized by special hardware. This shows that for high-speed networks, OQ switch with QoS guarantees is not only possible, but also feasible. © 2012 IEEE.

The CDF is engineered based on the three-port system with the wavelength-selective reflection feedback, where both micro-cavities are the synthesized coupled-resonators. In this case, the conditions to achieve complete power transfer are same to that of the corresponding three-port system while both micro-cavities are the single-mode resonators. As two micro-cavities are single point-defect resonators or synthesized coupled-resonators respectively, it is confirmed that these CDFs exhibit different response characteristics by the simulation results calculated by using two dimensional finite-difference time-domain (2D-FDTD) method, and these filters will find applications in future wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical communication systems. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

84885230466	Store, schedule and switch - A new data delivery model in the big data era	The big data era is posing unprecedented challenges on the existing network infrastructure. In today's networks, data are transferred across the network as a combination of a series of packets, delivered one by one, without considering the data in their entirety with respective service level requirements. The so called elephant data, which may be less sensitive to transfer delay, compete precious network resources with mice data, in most cases from interactive and delay sensitive applications. Consequently, the Quality of Service (QoS) of interactive applications is hard to provision, and the utility of network is low. We propose a new data transfer model to complement the existing per-packet forwarding paradigm. In the new data transfer model, a service level requirement is assigned (by the data source) to each big data transfer request. Instead of transferring these data on per-packet bases immediately upon entering the network, the network stores the data until it find necessary, or enough network resource is available for that transfer. The scheduled data delivery is realized through the use of dynamic circuit switching. We also present some preliminary simulation results of SSS networks. © 2013 IEEE.

When optical links are regarded as resources and jointly scheduled with other grid resources, communication contention must be taken into consideration for efficient task scheduling. This paper models the optical grid computing as a communicationaware Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scheduling problem. To reduce the communication contention, we propose to use hop-bytes metric (HBM) heuristic to select computing resource.

Our second contribution is an extensive analysis of web activity across these traces. By utilizing ReSurf, we study web-surfing behaviors in terms of user requests and transitions between websites (e.g. the click-through history of following hyperlinks). A surprising result is the prevalence of advertising and tracking services that are being accessed during web-surfing that are without the user's explicit consent. In our traces, we found that with 90% chance a user will access such a service after just three user requests (or 'clicks'). We believe that our methodology and findings provide valuable insights into modern traffic that can allow: (a) network administrators to better manage and protect their networks, (b) traffic regulators to protect the rights of on-line users, and (c) researchers to better understand the evolution of the traffic from modern websites. © 2013 IFIP.

84893669764	A novel dynamic wavelength bandwidth allocation scheme over OFDMA PONs	With rapid growth of Internet applications, supporting differentiated service and enlarging system capacity have been new tasks for next generation access system. In recent years, research in OFDMA Passive Optical Networks (PON) has experienced extraordinary development as for its large capacity and flexibility in scheduling. Although much work has been done to solve hardware layer obstacles for OFDMA PON, scheduling algorithm on OFDMA PON system is still under primary discussion. In order to support QoS service on OFDMA PON system, a novel dynamic wavelength bandwidth allocation (DWBA) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Per-stream QoS service is supported in this algorithm. Through simulation, we proved our bandwidth allocation algorithm performs better in bandwidth utilization and differentiate service support. © 2011 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

84893670653	Differentiated protection method in passive optical networks based on OPEX	Reliable service delivery becomes more significant due to increased dependency on electronic services all over society and the growing importance of reliable service delivery. As the capability of PON increasing, both residential and business customers may be included in a PON. Meanwhile, OPEX have been proven to be a very important factor of the total cost for a telecommunication operator. Thus, in this paper, we present the partial protection PON architecture and compare the operational expenditures (OPEX) of fully duplicated protection and partly duplicated protection for ONUs with different distributed fiber length, reliability requirement and penalty cost per hour. At last, we propose a differentiated protection method to minimize OPEX. © 2011 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

84896790960	Differentiated protection services with failure probability guarantee for workflow-based applications	A cost-effective and service-differentiated provisioning strategy is very desirable to service providers so that they can offer users satisfactory services, while optimizing network resource allocation. Providing differentiated protection services to connections for surviving link failure has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the differentiated protection services for workflow-based applications, which consist of many interdependent tasks, have scarcely been studied. This paper investigates the problem of providing differentiated services for workflow-based applications in optical grid. In this paper, we develop three differentiated protection services provisioning strategies which can provide security level guarantee and network-resource optimization for workflow-based applications. The simulation dem onstrates that these heuristic algorithms provide protection cost-effectively while satisfying the applications' failure probability requirements. © 2011 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

84897456407	Characterizing home network traffic: An inside view	The rapid spread of residential broadband connections and Internet-capable consumer devices in home networks has changed the landscape of Internet traffic. To gain a deep understanding of Internet traffic for home networks, this paper develops a traffic monitoring platform that collects and analyzes home network traffic via programmable home routers and traffic profiling servers. Using traffic data captured from real home networks, we present traffic characteristics in home networks and then apply principal component analysis to uncover temporal correlations among application ports. In light of prevalent unwanted traffic on the Internet, we characterize the intensity, sources, and port diversity of unwanted traffic toward home networks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study to characterize network traffic of Internet-capable devices from inside home network. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

84898379145	GMPLS for future applications: Performance characterization and measurements	Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching, or GMPLS, is a suite of protocols to enable automated resource discovery, automated service provisioning and automated failure recovery. In recent years, a considerable number of efforts have been seen in the area of putting GMPLS into advanced networking/service environments. This is exemplified by the various research programs in the US, Europe, and Asia. In such programs, GMPLS has not only been used as a way to reduce management complexity and increase reliability, like the industry is doing right now, but also it is used as a new way for service provisioning. In this chapter, the authors first review activities in using GMPLS controlled optical networks in high performance computing environments. They try to identify the benefits, as well as the limitations in such networking practices. Then they introduce the past and on-going standardization work in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) about GMPLS network performance characterization and measurement. Finally, the authors present the performance measurement results from a number of deployed GMPLS networks. © 2013, IGI Global.

84899045192	Dynamic bandwidth allocation&guarantee for virtualized networks in cloud	Among all SLAs(Service Level Agreements) about network resources in the cloud, a critical problem would be achieving bandwidth guarantee under all communication environment (e.g., when misbehaved VMs exist) while keeping acceptable bandwidth utility and system scalability. In this paper, we present an architecture of dynamic bandwidth allocation and guarantee on resource fairness, to provide network performance isolation and protocol independent bandwidth guarantees. In this paper, we first discuss the business model of bandwidth guarantee for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud, and a bandwidth allocation algorithm based on redefined fairness model is proposed and realized under the novel architecture, and finally experiment shows satisfying results under various communication scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.

84899126746	An efficient transportation architecture for big data movement	Big data are transferred, routed and forward to their destinations as a combination of a series of packets one by one, without considering the data in their entity in today's packet network. In this paper, we firstly summarize those transportation methods of bid data on packet networks and optical networks, respectively, and then propose a new data transportation architecture to collect, store and reshape the data flows in large time scale until it find the connection segments available on schedule. It leverages both circuit and storage merits together to form a now network node, which is termed as SSS in this paper. The intermediate storages act to relay and bridge these sub-connections into an equivalent entirety. © 2013 IEEE.

84902957060	On precision and scalability of elephant flow detection in data center with SDN	Software Defined Network (SDN) provides better network management and higher utilization for data center network, which decouples control plane from data plane. The centralized control of entire network may result in large overhead and limit the scalability of control plane. Previously, some researches [6] [7] proposed an approach for reducing work load on controller with elephant flow detection. However, the threshold of the detection system was pre-configured with a fixed value without consideration of the dynamically changing traffic characteristics in data center, which could cause high detection error rates. In this paper, we propose a two-stage adaptive elephant flow detection system that could precisely identify elephant flows with low-overhead on controller. The main challenge is to configure the relevant decision threshold adaptively. We formulate it as an optimization problem and present an optimal solution. Analysis and experiment showed the benefits of our system over previous methods. © 2013 IEEE.

84904729498	An effcient routing protocol in inter-domain traffc engineering	The RFID-enabled vehicle dynamic scheduling algorithm based on immune glowworm swarm optimizat- ion algorithm (IGSOA) was proposed for the real-time warehousing logistics vehicle scheduling problem (LVCP). A mathematical model for vehicle routing problem (VRP) with delivery cost is established, and the IGSOA is used to solve this model. combining with the GSO and CSA technology, this methmodology adopts a multi-layer evolution pattern. The polymorphic adaptive population mechanism and global extreme screening strategy are introduced in the low GSO operation and high immune operation, in order to improve the IGSOA convergence effciency. Based on above analysis, a vehicle dynamic scheduling framework is presented, and the vehicle dynamic scheduling process is divided into two stages as vehicle scheduling tasks control and VRP optimization. Finally the process of LVCP is given. Experimental results show that, the IGSOA can effectively solve large-scale LVCP. © 2014 Binary Information Press.
