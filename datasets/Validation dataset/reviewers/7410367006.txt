34548307141	Adaptive QRS-T cancellation based on wavelet transform for P-wave detection	A new algorithm for detecting P-wave is proposed by an adaptive QRS-T cancellation technique based on wavelet transform. In this paper, Mallat algorithm of the Marr wavelet transforms is used to prosecute multi-resolution analysis for the ECG signal, for each scale, only the local extrema of the transformation are kept while the other values are set equal to zero. Then QRS waves are located based on modulus maximum values, and QT interval is estimated subsequently. The QRS-T adaptive cancellation is conducted in the transformed domain by keeping only the DWT extrema present outside the QRS-T interval. The residual signal including the P wave is magnified by the nonlinear transform, and P wave position is achieved by the adaptive threshold detection of modulus maximum values. This method is used to detect the P-wave of ECG data from MIT-BIH, and got satisfactory results.

34547622485	Two point matching algorithms based on point spatial features	The fundamental theory and the antinoise problem of the traditional eigenvector approach (EA) are discussed and analyzed. Two matching algorithms are proposed, namely weighted eigenvector approach (WEA) and sorting approach (SA). WEA decomposes the intra-set distance matrices of point sets and gets the feature vectors of the points. Then, the feature vectors are weighted by the eigenvalues of matrices. The algorithm gets the matching map by comparing the similarity of the weighted feature vectors. Without the decomposition of matrices, SA acquires the characteristics of the point by sorting the distance matrices, and obtains the matching in the same way above. The two algorithms solve the choosing problem of Gauss parameter and have better antinoise ability than EA. Experimental results show the practicability of the algorithm and the better performance than that of EA.

84861715247	Road center-point extraction from high resolution SAR images using double windows detection and particle filtering	It is extremely difficult to extract road from high-resolution SAR images because of the existence of various kinds of disturbances, occlusions and shadowing. A new road center-point extraction method is proposed by combined using local detection and global tracking. In local detection phase, two windows are set. The outside window is used to obtain the local road direction by using non-linear structure tensor, based on the fact that fences, green belts and other disturbances point to a consistent direction with the edge of roads. The inside window adjusts its direction by the result of non-linear structure tensor. Then it searches for the road areas, and determines the width and center of roads. In global tracking phase, particle filter of variable-step is used for solving the problem of tracking broken frequently by occlusions on the road and shadowing alongside the road. In 1 m high-resolution airborne SAR image experiment, the results indicate that this method is effective.

There are conspicuous diffidence between the encroachments and transmission Lines and it is easy for human to distinguish the encroachments from the transmission Lines because the encroachments were always the saLient objects in the view, consequently, it is a reasonable way to detect the encroachments based on the mechanism of visual attention. The experiment results show that this method can effectively detect and locate different types of encroachments in different natural environments. © 2011 IEEE.

84863062856	A markerless motion capture system with automatic subject-specific body model acquisition and robust pose tracking from 3D data	We present a markerless system for recovering 3D full-body motion from multiple image sequences. Our approach supports robust pose tracking from 3D data as well as automatic body model acquisition. For initialization, a subject-specific voxel body model that fits well to the shape of the subject being tracked is automatically created from the beginning volume. Then for pose recovery, the voxel body model is matched to the image features via a hierarchical pose search method. We use a new particle based stochastic search algorithm and introduce a robust metric, which is incorporated with joint limits, physical constraints and fuses multiple 3D cues involving volume spatial and 3D scene flow motion information.

84865282544	Detecting insulators in the image of overhead transmission lines	Detecting and localizing the insulators automatically are very important to intelligent inspection, which are the prerequisites for fault diagnose. A novel method for insulators detection in the image of overhead transmission lines based on lattice detection is presented in this paper. Firstly, low-level visual features of images are analyzed, feature points are generated and grouped by their appearance similarities through mean shift clustering; then a insulator lattice model consistent with the geometric relationship between candidate point clusters is proposed by voting mechanism; subsequently, performing lattice finding using an MRF model, combined with the spatial context information to localize multiple insulators jointly; Finally, extracting the minimum bounding rectangle of the target image. Since the location of each insulator is constrained by its neighbors, each of them provides knowledge about the others, the MRF model is a natural choice for inferring insulators locations while enforcing spatial lattice constraints and image likelihood constraints. The experimental results indicate that the method can effectively detect the deformed insulators of different kinds under complex background. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84865983943	Automatic road network extraction in high resolution SAR images based on MRF	It is extremely difficult to extract road networks from high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images due to the presence of various disturbances. Markov random field (MRF) model can make full use of the imagery contextual characters and priori knowledge, which have been widely used to extract road networks. However, there exist some problems such as slow solution and many parameters setting of these type methods. In order to reduce the computation of subsequent iterative solution of MRF, pre-linking is firstly introduced to remove numerous false line elements based on the spatial relationship among them. Then the improved road networks Markov function model is established to label road networks. SAR images with 1 meter resolution are tested in the experiment. The results show the effectivity of the method mentioned above in high resolution SAR imagery road network extraction.

84869413239	Imaging of transmission equipment by saliency-based compressive sampling	The traditional intelligent inspection system often takes high-resolution images and then compressed through the codec for efficient storage purpose, which leads to the waste of image data and memory resources. The compressive sampling theory showed that under certain conditions, a signal can be precisely reconstructed from only a small set of measurements, however, the reconstruction algorithms are generally very expensive. By studying on the need of imaging of the transmission equipment, we adopt an imaging method based on saliency to balance the reconstruction complexities and the quality of image. The method first uses a low-resolution complementary sensor to obtain the saliency information of the scene, then obtains the saliency map of the imaging scene by the spectral residual approach, and then assigns higher sample rate to the area of transmission equipment and lower sample rate to the background area in compressive imaging. The simulation results show that the image of transmission equipment can be precisely reconstructed from only a small set of measurements. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Therefore, if road junctions are identified accurately, the quality of road extraction can be improved. However, they are often neglected by most methods for road extraction. This letter presents a road junction extraction method with two stages. First, global detection is performed to find the centre positions of the road junction candidates by using morphological operators. Second, the shape of a road junction is identified based on a valley-finding algorithm. The proposed method is validated by airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of 1 m resolution.

84871395107	GPU-accelerated real-time tracking of full-body motion with multi-layer search	Compared to monocular pose tracking, 3D articulated body pose tracking from multiple cameras can better deal with self-occlusions and meet less ambiguities. Though considerable advances have been made, pose tracking from multiple images has not been extensively studied: very seldom existing work can produce a solution comparable to that of a marker-based system which generally can recover accurate 3D full-body motion in real-time. In this paper, we present a multi-view approach to 3D body pose tracking. We propose a pose search method by introducing a new generative sampling algorithm with a refinement step of local optimization. This multi-layer search method does not rely on strong motion priors and generalizes well to general human motions. Physical constraints are incorporated in a novel way and 3D distance transform is employed for speedup. A voxel subject-specific 3D body model is created automatically at the initial frame to fit the subject to be tracked. We design and develop the optimized parallel implementations of time-consuming algorithms on GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which significantly accelerates the pose tracking process, making our method capable of tracking full body movements with a maximum speed of 9 fps. Experiments on various 8-camera datasets and benchmark datasets (HumanEva-II) captured by 4 cameras demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our method. © 1999-2012 IEEE.

84872167863	Road extraction from high-resolution SAR images via automatic local detecting and human-guided global tracking	Because of existence of various kinds of disturbances, layover effects, and shadowing, it is difficult to extract road from high-resolution SAR images. A new road center-point searching method is proposed by two alternant steps: local detection and global tracking. In local detection step, double window model is set, which consists of the outer fixed square window and the inner rotary rectangular one. The outer window is used to obtain the local road direction by using orientation histogram, based on the fact that the surrounding objects always range along with roads. The inner window rotates its orientation in accordance with the result of local road direction calculation and searches the center points of a road segment. In global tracking step, particle filter of variable-step is used to deal with the problem of tracking frequently broken by shelters along the roadside and obstacles on the road. Finally, the center-points are linked by quadratic curve fitting. In 1 m high-resolution airborne SAR image experiment, the results show that this method is effective. © 2012 Jianghua Cheng et al.

84876057137	An algorithm improving objects detection for low-quality video using stochastic resonance	Video object extraction is a key technology in intelligence surveillance. An object detection algorithm for low-quality video based on Gaussian Mix Model and stochastic resonance was proposed. Firstly, the algorithm generated the object probability gray image from the current frame with the Gaussian Mix Model by the mapping function defined. Then, stochastic resonance was applied to the object probability gray image by adding noise until the defined evaluation function achieved the minimum value. After stochastic resonance, an effectively enhanced object probability gray image could be obtained. Hence the binary image including the interested objects is retrieved by segmentation of the enhanced object probability gray image. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm combining the Gaussian Mix Model and the stochastic resonance achieved satisfactory subjective and objective performance under the worse environment with dark, foggy and infrared imaging while the classic background subtraction method almost could not detect the interested objects.

84879170328	Dimensionality reduction based on sparse representation and nonparametric discriminant analysis	Aiming at the face recognition problem, a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm is presented. On the basis of sparse representation theory, the proposed algorithm uses the within-class sparse construction to construct graph. This scheme can avoid the difficulty of parameter selection in traditional graph construction methods, and characterize the within-class information well. Furthermore, the multi-class nonparametric discriminant scatter is applied to characterize the between-class information, which will be more discriminative than parametric discriminant scatter in dealing with complex-distributed data. By maximizing the nonparametric between-class scatter and preserving the within-class sparse reconstructive relationship, the proposed algorithm can seek for the optimal projection matrix. Experimental results on ORL and Extended Yale B dataset show that the proposed method can achieve good recognition effect.

Assuming that the region of interest (ROI) of ship in SAR imagery has been extracted, the detail procedures of the proposed refined segmentation can be summarized as follows. First, the ship's ROI image is transformed to radon domain, in which pixel intensities are cumulated along different directions. Then, the peak areas are separated to extract the ship's orientation and the main image area of the ship that orthogonal to the principal axis. Finally, the refined segmentation is achieved in the main image area.

84891124229	Improved RX algorithm with global statistics	Anomaly detection of hyperspectral is a hot issue in the remote sensing field. Anomaly detection algorithms currently proposed can be classified into two class, global algorithm and local algorithm. Global algorithm may lead to miss alarm since the discrimination is not accurate enough. On the contrary, local algorithm may bring about false alarm because of lack of global statistics. An improved RX algorithm integrating local and global statistics is proposed. Firstly K-means algorithm is carried out to cluster the whole image into K class which is determined with a virtual dimension estimation method. Then the improved RX is proposed by integrating the global cluster information and the local statistics. Experiment results show that the improved algorithm can obtain a better detection performance than RX algorithm. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84891586689	Discriminant embedding by sparse representation and nonparametric discriminant analysis for face recognition	A novel supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm, named discriminant embedding by sparse representation and nonparametric discriminant analysis (DESN), was proposed for face recognition. Within the framework of DESN, the sparse local scatter and multi-class nonparametric between-class scatter were exploited for within-class compactness and between-class separability description, respectively. These descriptions, inspired by sparse representation theory and nonparametric technique, are more discriminative in dealing with complex-distributed data. Furthermore, DESN seeks for the optimal projection matrix by simultaneously maximizing the nonparametric between-class scatter and minimizing the sparse local scatter. The use of Fisher discriminant analysis further boosts the discriminating power of DESN. The proposed DESN was applied to data visualization and face recognition tasks, and was tested extensively on the Wine, ORL, Yale and Extended Yale B databases. Experimental results show that DESN is helpful to visualize the structure of high-dimensional data sets, and the average face recognition rate of DESN is about 9.4%, higher than that of other algorithms. © 2013 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In addition, the LSR model and adaptive dictionary learning were incorporated into a unified optimization framework, which explicitly established the inner connection of them. Such processing allows us to simultaneously update sparse coding vectors and the dictionary by alternating-optimization method.

84896273935	Feature selection and weighted SVM classifier-based ship detection in polSAR imagery	Target decomposition is an important method for ship detection in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Parameters such as the polarization entropy and alpha angle deduced from the coherency matrix eigenvalue decomposition capture the differences between the target and background from different views separately. However, under the conditions of a relatively high resolution and a rough sea, the contrast between ship and sea reduces in the aforementioned space. Based on the analyses of target decomposition theory and the target's scattering mechanism, multi-polarization parameters can be used to characterize different scattering behaviours of the ship target and sea clutter. Moreover, each parameter has its own diverse significance in the practical detection problem. This article proposes a feature selection and weighted support vector machine (FSWSVM) classifier-based algorithm to detect ships in polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) imagery. First, the method constructs a feature vector that consists of multi-polarization parameters. Then, different polarization parameters are refined and weighted according to their significance in the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, ships are classified from the sea background and other false alarms by the classifier. The validation results on National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL) airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) and Radarsat-2 quad polarimetric data illustrate that the method detects ship targets more precisely and reduces false alarms effectively. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.
