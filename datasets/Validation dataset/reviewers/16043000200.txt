84929600643	A novel beam splitter based on graded photonic crystals	This study proposes a novel beam splitter system based on graded photonic crystals, wherein the GPCs are part of a circular PC. A self-collimating PC structure with a square lattice is added to improve transmissivity. The total transmissivity is increased by extending the defect of the self-collimating PC. This study presents a beam splitter system with low energy loss and the best total transmissivity of almost 90%. Furthermore, the relationship between the beam-splitting ratio and the light position is discovered, and the beam-splitting ratio may be changed discretionarily and expediently. Numerical results are obtained using finite-difference time domain and plane wave methods. The proposed structure has significant application potential in optical integration.

13944275620	Multiple image encryption and watermarking by random phase matching	Usually a set of transmitted patterns can realize encryption and/or watermarking just for one hidden image. In this paper, we propose a novel method of multiple image encryption and watermarking by random phase matching, which can encrypt and then decrypt more than one image with the same set of transmitted patterns based on the idea of double phase encoding and the wave field superposition. The principle and procedure of this method are explained. A series of computer simulations with phase-shifting interferometry have shown that two or four independent images can be encrypted and decrypted without or with watermarking successfully with one set of composite interferograms. The ability of this method to retrieve hidden image(s) from part of the transmitted patterns has also been verified. This technique can considerably raise the efficiency of data transmission, and it is particularly suitable for the image transmission via Internet. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

17044391066	Common form of the complex wave error caused by arbitrary phase shift errors in generalized phase-shifting interferometry and its digital correction	Our analysis reveals that the complex wave error caused by arbitrary phase-shift errors in generalized phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) with arbitrary frames and arbitrary phase shift design takes the common form: a linear combination of the correct complex wave and its conjugation. Consequently, the simple method of digital wave correction we proposed recently for standard PSI is extended to the generalized PSI of any algorithms. Computer simulations show that this method can depress both the amplitude error and the phase error simultaneously and significantly by 2-3 orders of magnitude for arbitrary irregular phase shift errors as large as up to 20% without the need of calibration or the knowledge of the actual phase shifts. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this method, the shearogram is obtained by interference of a real object wave-front and a virtual object wave-front. The former is optically recorded and then digitally reconstructed; and the latter is introduced digitally by repositioning or reforming the former. The obvious advantages of VSI over conventional shearing interferometry (SI) are its versatility, accuracy, and simplicity. Only one real field is necessary to produce shearogram; there is no need of any real shearing device or even the phase unwrapping computation; and the digital shear can take any possible form according to different purposes. Both the optical experiments and computer simulations with lateral shearing, 180°rotational shearing and double lateral shearing for evaluation of lens aberrations in the general case including spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, defocus, and tilts based on phase-shifting interferometry are given to verify the effectiveness of this method. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33750952148	Cross-talk free image encryption and watermarking by digital holography and random composition	In previous image watermarking methods an encoded host image and a watermark image are usually directly added, consequently the two images have cross-talk in the decryption step. To eliminate this effect, we propose a novel method based on digital holography, in which all the image pixels of the two sets of holograms resulted from two hidden images are rearranged and integrated into one set of composite holograms with a random scattering matrix (RSM). In decryption the use of this matrix can ensure the exact retrieval of each hologram, and then the perfect reconstruction of each image without cross-talk noise can be achieved. The feasibility of this method and its robustness against occlusion and additional noise are verified by computer simulations with phase-shifting interferometry and double random-phase encoding technique.

A general formula of the mean square wave reconstruction error for different phase shift selection and different phase shift errors is derived, and its specific expressions for the equal, linear, and random phase shift errors are deduced. The results reveal that there is a wide range for phase shift selection in GPSI, and the equal phase step algorithm is superior to the one of unequal step where the three kinds of phase shift errors are concerned. Specifically, the phase step [image omitted] leads to the minimum wave reconstruction error in the cases of equal and linear phase shift errors, while the phase step 1.91 rad yields the smallest wave reconstruction error for random phase shift errors.

The watermark image to be hidden is first encoded into a kinoform by utilizing the iterative phase retrieval algorithm in a virtual lens system. The weighted kinoform is embedded into the low-frequency DWT coefficients (LL3) of the host image to accomplish the watermark embedding process. In the process of watermark extraction, the embedded kinoform can be extracted by subtracting the corresponding DWT coefficients of the host image, from that of the watermarked image. Then, the original hidden image can be retrieved by taking the real amplitude of Fourier transform (FT) information for the extracted kinoform. The robustness and imperceptibility of watermarked image with the different weighting factors are demonstrated and analyzed in detail.

The theoretical analysis and a set of numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate how the secret key of the encryption system can be derived out with our proposed strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869482278	Optical hierarchical authentication based on interference and hash function	We propose a method to achieve the purpose of hierarchical authentication on the basis of two beams' interference and the one-way hash function. For this security protection system, only if the "phase key" and the password-controlled "phase lock" of a user are verified simultaneously can one obtain a permission to visit the confidential resources of the system. Moreover, this scheme can not only check the legality of the users but also verify their identity levels so as to grant them corresponding hierarchical access permissions. The authentication process is straightforward; the phase key and the password-controlled phase lock of one user are loading on two spatial light modulators in advance, by which two coherent beams are modulated and then interfere with each other at the output plane leading to an output image. By comparing the output image with all the standard certification images in the database, the system can thus verify the user's identity. However, the system designing process involves an iterative modified phase retrieval algorithm. For an authorized user, a phase lock is first created based on a "digital fingerprint," which is the result of a hash function on a preselected user password. The corresponding phase key can then be determined by use of the phase lock and a designated standard certification image. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations both validate the effectiveness of our method. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

84869014078	Collision in optical image encryption based on interference and a method for avoiding this security leak	From the perspective of cryptography, collision is an undesirable situation that occurs when two or more distinct inputs into a security system produce undistinguishable outputs. In this paper we present a study of the collision property of the optical image encryption technique based on interference (Zhang et al. Optics Letters; 2008:33(21)). For an arbitrary secret image (output) to be encrypted, we can find various distinct pairs of phase-only masks (inputs), which yield almost the same outputs by use of a modified phase retrieval algorithm. Meanwhile, we also provide an efficient way to avoid this potential risk by adding an extra unit in the original structure, which can thus be called a double-factor verification system. A series of computer simulations were also carried out to demonstrate our concern and strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84872503926	Two-factor authentication system based on optical interference and one-way Hash function	We present a two-factor authentication method to verify the personal identification who tries to access an optoelectronic system. This method is based on the optical interference principle and the traditional one-way Hash function (e.g. MD5). The authentication process is straightforward, the phase key and the password-controlled phase lock of one user are loading on two Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) in advance, by which two coherent beams are modulated and then interference with each other at the output plane leading to an output image. By comparing the output image with all the standard certification images in the database, the system can thus verify the user's identity. However, the system designing process involves an iterative Modified Phase Retrieval Algorithm (MPRA). For an authorized user, a phase lock is first created based on a "Digital Fingerprint (DF)", which is the result of a Hash function on a preselected user password. The corresponding phase key can then be determined by use of the phase lock and a designated standard certification image. Note that the encode/design process can only be realized by digital means while the authentication process could be achieved digitally or optically. Computer simulations were also given to validate the proposed approach. © 2012 SPIE.

84873688364	Two-dimensional silicon nitride photonic crystal band gap characteristics	Plane-wave expansion method was employed to analyze the photonic band gap in two-dimensional silicon nitride photonic crystal. The effects of filling ratio and lattice structure type on the photonic band gap were studied. The results showed that two-dimensional dielectric cylinder type silicon nitride photonic crystal only has TE mode band gap, while, the air column type photonic crystal has complete band gap for TE and TM modes simultaneously. The distribution of band gap can be influenced by the filling ratio of dielectric materials and the lattice type. It is shown that the triangular lattice structure is much easier to form band gap than square lattice structure. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84876065939	Multi-level authentication based on two-beam interference	A method of multi-level authentication based on two-beam interference is proposed. By verifying the "password" and "phase key" of one user simultaneously, the system can thus achieve the two-factor authentication on the user's identity. This scheme can not only check the legality of one user, but also verify his identity level as an authorized user and then grant the user the corresponding permissions to access the system resources. While operating the authentication process, which largely depends on an optical setup based on interference, a "phase key" and a password-controlled "phase lock" are firstly loaded on two spatial light modulators (SLMs), separately. Then two coherent beams are respectively, modulated by the two SLMs and then interfere with each other, leading to an interference pattern in the output plane. It is recorded and transmitted to the computer to finish the last step of the authentication process: comparing the interference pattern with the standard verification images in the database of the system to verify whether it is an authorized user. When it turns to the system designing process for a user, which involves an iterative algorithm to acquire an estimated solution of an inverse problem, we need to determine the "phase key" according to a modified phase retrieval iterative algorithm under the condition of an arbitrarily given "phase lock" and a previously determined identity level (corresponding to a certain standard verification image). The theoretical analysis and simulation experiments both validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

84884516672	Simultaneous measurement of optical inhomogeneity and thickness variation by using dual-wavelength phase-shifting photorefractive holographic interferometry	A method to measure thickness variation and optical inhomogeneity simultaneously with a dual-wavelength phase-shifting photorefractive holographic interferometer is proposed. This method has no special requirements on the sample surfaces, and additional operations such as coating refractive index matching liquid on surfaces is not needed. With the help of photorefractive holographic interferometry, the wavefront distortion caused by the interferometer system is compensated automatically. Compared with other methods, this method is simpler and more accurate. Computer simulation and optical experiment have verified its feasibility and reliability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84884689381	Phase-Shift Extraction and Wavefront Reconstruction in Generalized Phase-Shifting Interferometry with a Standard Phase Object	A method to extract phase shifts and reconstruct the object wave in generalized phase-shifting interferometry (GPSI) is proposed. The phase distribution of a standard phase object and the least-square method are used to extract phase shifts over a wide range from 0 to π. Consequently, the tested object wave can be further reconstructed with the extracted phase shifts. It is accurate and applicable for GPSI of any frame number N (N ≥ 2).

84885587592	An evaluation method for phase shift extraction algorithms in generalized phase-shifting interferometry	A method to evaluate quantitatively the performance of the phase shift extraction algorithms in generalized phase-shifting interferometry (GPSI) is proposed. A parameter named as reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (R-SNR) is used as the evaluation measure. The R-SNR is defined with the reconstructed object image as the signal and the residual of the DC term and conjugate image as noise. The more accurate the extracted phase shift is, the less residual of the DC term and conjugate image there is, and then the higher R-SNR is obtained. To avoid the overlap of the DC term and conjugate image and the object image, the off-axis digital holography configuration is adopted. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method have been verified by both computer simulation and optical experiments. The major advantage of the proposed method is that it utilizes the experimental detectable data and not only the computer simulation results. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84886081241	Asymmetric cryptosystem using random binary phase modulation based on mixture retrieval type of Yang-Gu algorithm: Comment	We comment on the recent Letter, by Liu et al. [Opt. Lett. 38, 1651 (2013)] in which a method to improve the security strength of the asymmetric cryptosystem (ACS) by Qin and Peng [Opt. Lett. 35, 118 (2010)] was proposed. However, in accordance with Liu's methodology, we could easily find other more efficient ways to achieve their purpose. More importantly, we think it is vitally necessary to point out that there exists a widespread, fundamental misunderstanding on the concept of ACS, which has also been studied in a series of related works. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84891870556	Classification and comparison of phase shift extraction algorithms in generalized phase-shifting interferometry	Based on the summarization and classification on different kinds of phase shift extraction algorithms in generalized phase-shifting interferometry (GPSI), an evaluation and comparing method for these GPSI algorithms is proposed according to experimental detectable amount. Based on off-axis digital holography, by using the residual of direct current (DC) term and conjugate image in reconstructed wave field as criterion, GPSI algorithms can then be evaluated and compared by defining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in reconstructed wave field. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation experiment have proven that the bigger the SNR is, the little the residual of DC term and conjuage image is and the more accurate the extracted phase shift is. Six typical algorithms are compared in simulation and optical experiment and the results are consistent, which verify the feasibility and validity of this method.

84892391161	Asymmetric light propagation based on graded photonic crystals	This study proposes a novel graded photonic crystal structure that can be used to achieve asymmetric light propagation. This structure is obtained by changing the radius of a conventional square lattice photonic crystal. A higher contrast ratio is obtained by extending the numbers of the periods of the graded photonic crystal in the horizontal direction. The best contrast ratio almost reaches 1. The intensity at the spot where the light propagated forward converges is two orders of magnitude greater than the intensity at the optical axis of the backward transmission. Numerical results are obtained using the finite-difference time domain and plane wave methods. The proposed structure has significant application potential in optical integration. © 2013 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

84907501030	Multi-plane reconstruction and auto-focus method of gabor in-line digital holography	For the near-field in-line digital holography, the multi-plane reconstruction method used to eliminate the twin image works well when the reconstructing distance is exactly equal to the actual recording distance. However, it does not consider and analyze the influence when there is a deviation between the two distances. In practice, it is difficult to accurately measure the actual recording distance, and the deviation between the reconstructing distance and the actual recording distance always exist in the digital reproduction. A thoughtful analysis for this method is presented and it is found that this method is very sensitive to the distance deviation, and as the deviation increases its efficiency and effectiveness will be greatly decreased. The distance deviation sensitivity of this method can be used to improve the auto-focus accuracy and sensibility in the reconstruction of Gabor in-line digital holography. Principle analysis and experimental verification confirm the above conclusions.
