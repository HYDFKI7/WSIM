84876806688	Monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin A	A sensitive and specific monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established and validated for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA). After routine fusion and selection, 10 monoclonal antibodies showed high affinity for SEA. An optimal pair for sandwich ELISA was selected by pairwise interaction analysis. After optimization, the limit of detection (LOD) and linear dynamic range of the method were established, and were found to be 0.0282 ng/mL and 0.06-2 ng/mL, respectively. The recovery in pure milk ranged from 82.67% to 111.95% and the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 3.16% to 6.05% and from 5.16% to 10.79%, respectively. Cross-reactivity with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC), staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SED), and staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE) in this method were insignificant. These results indicate that the sandwich ELISA method developed in our study is effective for routine identification of SEA in food samples.

It was found that QDs could increase the specificity of the PCR at different annealing temperatures and with DNA templates of different lengths. The effects of QDs on the efficiency of the PCR were also studied, and the results snowed that there was no enhancement. The mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed. This method could be used to modify the amplification results of the conventional PCR. Furthermore, this technology could make the PCR more widely applicable, especially in the multi-PCR reaction system with different annealing temperatures.

66449090047	Nanoparticle superstructures made by polymerase chain reaction: Collective interactions of nanoparticles and a new principle for chiral materials	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was realized on the surface of gold nanoparticles (NPs) as a tool for self-organization at nanoscale and as a step toward programmable production of sufficient quantities of functional metallic superstructures. The assembly is controlled by varying thedensity of the primer on the surface of gold NPs and the number of PCR cycles generating amixture of dimers trimers tetramers etc. with gradually increasing complexity. This process leads to strong chirality of the assemblies arising from the three-dimensional positioning of NPs in space which had never been observed before. A circular dichroism band of the super structures coincides with the plasmon oscillations of the multi-NPsystems of Au colloids. This new collective optical property of NP s embracing the diversity of shapes and diameters in the starting dispersions opens unique opportunities for the development of negative index materials. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

An immune complex was formed using avidin as the bridge to link the Bt-dBSA-QDs with the antibodies. Primarily, individual quantitative determinations of five representative chemical residues were carried out based on the different emission properties of the QDs. Five antibodies were then conjugated with the corresponding QDs to establish the indirect competition fluorescent-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-FLISA) for the simultaneous detection of five chemicals in one well of a microplate. The linear range for dexamethason (DEX) was from 0.33 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg, 0.28 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg for gentamicin (GM), 0.16 μg/kg to 25 μg/kg for clonazepam (CZP), 0.17 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg for medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and 0.32 μg/kg to 25 μg/kg for ceftiofur (CEF), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) for the simultaneous determination of DEX, GM, CZP, MPA and CEF were as low as 0.13 μg/kg, 0.16 μg/kg, 0.07 μg/kg, 0.06 μg/kg and 0.14 μg/kg, respectively. This detection method was used to analyze samples of pork muscle and the recoveries ranged from 61.3% to 80.3% for DEX and from 74.0% to 87.2% for MPA. Further more, good correlation between the novel ic-FLISA and traditional ELISA was demonstrated during the determination of DEX and MPA residues in real samples. The QD-based protocol described here is less time consuming than the classical method and it may be sufficiently flexible to be used in other systems for the simultaneous multicolor detection of the drugs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

70350633756	Ultrasensitive detection of trace protein by western blot based on POLY-quantum dot probes	In this study, we describe an ultrasensitive quantum dots (QDs)-based Western blot. With the high affinity of avidin-functionalized POLY-QDs and simplification of the detection process, this enabled the quantitative analysis of protein by Western blotting. To prepare the POLY-QDs, CdTe quantum dots were first coated with biotinylated denatured bovine serum albumin and then, via the effect of the biotin-avidin system, the biotinylated denatured bovine serum albumin-coated QDs, which had strong fluorescence, were linked together. With this series of modifications, the fluorescence intensity of CdTe QDs was significantly increased. Using the POLY-QDs as labels, the signal of Western blotting was more sensitive in tracing the protein than traditional dyeing. In the present study, trace protein A was applied to POLY-QDs-based Western blotting as a model. The linearity of this method was from 30 pg to 1.5 ng, and the sensitivity was up to low pictogram values. The final fluorescence signal on the polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membrane was retained for at least 40 min. The results of this study indicate that the POLY-QDs-based Western blot is an excellent quantitative analytical method for trace protein analysis. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

71949095893	Simple, rapid, sensitive, and versatile SWNT-paper sensor for environmental toxin detection competitive with ELISA	Safety of water was for a long time and still is one of the most pressing needs for many countries and different communities. Despite the fact that there are potentially many methods to evaluate water safety, finding a simple, rapid, versatile, and inexpensive method for detection of toxins in everyday items is still a great challenge. In this study, we extend the concept of composites, impregnated porous fibrous materials, such as fabrics and papers, by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), toward very simple but high-performance biosensors. They utilize the strong dependence of electrical conductivity through nanotubes percolation network on the width of nanotube-nanotube tunneling gap and can potentially satisfy all the requirements outlined above for the routine toxin monitoring. An antibody to the microcystin-LR (MC-LR), one of the common culprits in mass poisonings, was dispersed together with SWNTs. This dispersion was used to dip-coat the paper rendering it conductive. The change in conductivity of the paper was used to sense the MC-LR in the water rapidly and accurately. The method has the linear detection range up to 10 nmol/L and nonlinear detection up to 40 nmol/L. The limit of detection was found to be 0.6 nmol/L (0.6 ng/mL), which satisfies the strictest World Health Organization standard for MC-LR content in drinking water (1 ng/mL) and is comparable to the detection limit of the traditional ELISA method of MC-LR detection, while drastically reducing the time of analysis by more than an order of magnitude, which is one of the major hurdles in practical applications. Similar technology of sensor preparation can also be used for a variety of other rapid environmental sensors. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

Developing an easy, fast, and sensitive method for the routine melamine detection is of great importance. Herein, we report the colorimetric sensing of melamine, based on the 18-crown-6 ether functionalized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) through the formation of cavity complexes with amines. Based on high extinction coefficients and spectral sensitivity of the surface plasmon resonance band of the GNPs, the rapid and sensitive melamine detection was achieved both visually and spectroscopically. Under the optimal conditions, melamine could be selectively detected in a concentration range from 10 to 500. ppb with a limit of detection as 6. ppb (3. σ), which is much lower than the strictest melamine safety requirement of 1. ppm. To demonstrate the selectivity and practicality of the method, melamine detection was realized in the real complex samples (dairy) with excellent analyte concentration recovery, indicating its applicability for real-time monitoring of toxins in common products. Crown ether assembly of GNP also opens a new route for the formation of three-dimensional pseudorotaxane-like assemblies of nanoparticles that can be applicable to a variety of amine-bearing ligands. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

80051945949	Permselectivity replication of artificial glomerular basement membranes in nanoporous collagen multilayers	Basement membranes (BMs) play important roles in many biological functions such as tissue regeneration, cancer proliferation, nutrient/drug delivery, breathing, and many others. While there are many theoretical models, adequate experimental analogues of BMs describing basic physicochemical properties of BM, such as diffusion and permselectivity, are not available. Taking BMs found in glomerulus of kidneys as an example, adequate reproduction of their permselectivity requires biomimetic membranes with submicrometer thickness, high uniformity, nanoscale porosity, and size-selective permeability. Artificial kidney BMs were assembled from poly(acrylic acid) and collagen using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technology and display multiple structural similarities with glomerular BMs. Diffusional transport through the artificial BMs faithfully replicate cutoff parameters of kidney membranes. Their utilization in understanding of unique diffusion processes in kidneys, in vitro studies of the blood clearance time of small drugs/nanoscale drug carriers, and design of more complex organoids including live cells for cancer proliferation studies is anticipated. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80051947605	Sensitive and specific DNA detection based on nicking endonuclease-assisted fluorescence resonance energy transfer amplification	We report a method for the detection of target DNA through nicking endonuclease (NEase)-assisted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) amplification. In this study, target DNA with specific recognition nucleotide sequences was used, which could be recognized by NEase. NEase has the sensitivity and specificity to recognize specific nucleotide sequences in double-stranded DNA (the hybridization of linker DNA and target DNA) and cleave only the linker DNA. The released target DNA could then trigger the cleavage of a large molar excess of linker DNA. The more the target DNA and the more the cleaved linker DNA, the less the FRET was induced by the linker DNA. The detection range of this method was found to range from 0.1 to 50 nM, and the limit of detection was 0.077 nM. On the basis of this technology, the interference of other mismatched target molecules could be effectively avoided; even a single-base mutation at the NEase recognition site could be detected. We therefore propose that NEase-assisted FRET, with some modifications, could have a variety of practical applications in the specific and sensitive detection of DNA. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84855787130	Facile and rapid magnetic relaxation switch immunosensor for endocrine-disrupting chemicals	In order to develop facile, fast and sensitive detection methods for endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), we described a sensitive biosensing system involving magnetic relaxation switch, based on the assembly of cross-linked superparamagnetic iron oxide (CLIO) nanoparticles induced by the antigen-antibody biorecognition. The design of smart CLIO-based superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and antigen-OVA was described for the detection of bisphenol A [2,2-bis (4-hydroxyphenol) propane (BPA)]. The addition of BPA to the rapid magnetic relaxation switch immunosensor led to transverse relaxation time (T2) shortening compared to a blank control as shown by NMR relaxometry measurements. This process was also applied to the rapid and facile determination of concentrations of BPA in drinking water (tap water). Good linearity for all calibration curves was obtained, and the limit of detection (LOD) for BPA was 0.4. ng/mL in tap water. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The detection of PCBs in food packaging materials is becoming increasingly essential. The method based on combining accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), sulfuric acid and silica gel column cleanup with gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) was found to be simple and efficient for the determination of the levels of the pollutants in the assays. The calibration curves of PCB28, PCB52, PCB101, PCB118, PCB138, PCB153, PCB180, PCB198 presented a good linearity in the range of 4-200 μg/L, the coefficients of variation and the limits of determination were in the range of 0.9982-0.9999 and 0.1828-0.3798 μg/L, respectively. The overall relative standard derivations were less than 4.11% and the average recoveries were in the range of 77.90%-100.08%. Compared with Soxhlet extraction method, the optimal ASE sample preparation can reduce analysis time and solvent consumption, and enable unequivocal identification and quantification. © 2012.

GNRs were assembled into nanorod chains through the bio-recognition. The SERS signal of the probe molecule modified to the end of the NRs could be enhanced due to the hot spot between the NRs.

84862780286	Systematic comparisons of genetically modified organism DNA separation and purification by various functional magnetic nanoparticles	DNA extraction is always an important and key step in bioanalytical fields for target nucleic acid detection. Traditional organic solvent-based extraction methods are toxic and time-consuming. In this work, we report a systematic study of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as probes for genomic DNA extraction from genetically modified organism (GMO) plants. Different surface-functionalised MNPs with controllable diameters have been used to extract the genomic DNA directly from GMO plants for detections. Systematic comparison of the results obtained under different extraction conditions has indicated that carboxyl-modified MNPs with smaller diameters are more suitable for genomic DNA extractions. The successful qualitative detection of GMO and non-GMO products based on the MNP extracted DNA is also achieved and discussed in this article. In view of the advantages of magnetic extraction, such as nontoxicity, ease of operation, and rapid and high throughput, this systematic research has demonstrated the great potential of the method and provides theoretical guidance for practical MNP applications. © 2012 The Authors.

84863011170	Regiospecific plasmonic assemblies for in Situ Raman spectroscopy in live cells	Multiple properties of plasmonic assemblies are determined by their geometrical organization. While high degree of complexity was achieved for plasmonic superstructures based on nanoparticles (NPs), little is known about the stable and structurally reproducible plasmonic assemblies made up from geometrically diverse plasmonic building blocks. Among other possibilities, they open the door for the preparation of regiospecific isomers of nanoscale assemblies significant both from a fundamental point of view and optical applications. Here, we present a synthetic method for complex assemblies from NPs and nanorods (NRs) based on selective modification of NRs with DNA oligomers. Three types of assemblies denoted as End, Side, and Satellite isomers that display distinct elements of regiospecificity were prepared with the yield exceeding 85%. Multiple experimental methods independently verify various structural features, uniformity, and stability of the prepared assemblies. The presence of interparticle gaps with finely controlled geometrical parameters and inherently small size comparable with those of cellular organelles fomented their study as intracellular probes. Against initial expectations, SERS intensity for End, Side, and Satellite isomers was found to be dependent primarily on the number of the NPs in the superstructures rationalized with the help of electrical field simulations. Incubation of the label-free NP-NR assemblies with HeLa cells indicated sufficient field enhancement to detect structural lipids of mitochondria and potentially small metabolites. This provided the first proof-of-concept data for the possibility of real-time probing of the local organelle environment in live cells. Further studies should include structural optimization of the assemblies for multitarget monitoring of metabolic activity and further increase in complexity for applications in transformative optics. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

DNA nanotechnology offers both versatility of particle arrangements and multiple gateways to interesting optical, electronic, biological, and catalytic properties. In this work we used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to produce complex superstructures from heterogeneously-sized gold nanoparticles. By controlling the number of PCR cycles and primer density, two distinct superstructures were assembled at asymmetric and symmetric PCR. With the increasing of PCR number, the size of structures was accordingly increased in the range 35-600nm. More importantly, the scaled-up GNP superstructures exhibited tunable chirality, which showed distinct differences between asymmetric and symmetric PCR. The origin of the chirality was analyzed from both an experimental and theoretical point of view. The heterogeneity of GNPs and conformational transition of self-assembly contributed to the occurrence of chirality in the GNP superstructures. PCR could be a very important and potentially useful tool for the controllable preparation of scaled-up superstructures with tunable chirality, and this experimental and mechanical research could significantly promote the technical development of chiral material preparation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

84865063411	Dynamic nanoparticle assemblies	Although nanoparticle (NP) assemblies are at the beginning of their development, their unique geometrical shapes and media-responsive optical, electronic, and magnetic properties have attracted significant interest. Nanoscale assembly bridges multiple levels of hierarchy of materials: individual nanoparticles, discrete molecule-like or virus-like nanoscale agglomerates, microscale devices, and macroscale materials. The capacity to self-assemble can greatly facilitate the integration of nanotechnology with other technologies and, in particular, with microscale fabrication. In this Account, we describe developments in the emerging field of dynamic NP assemblies, which are spontaneously form superstructures containing more than two inorganic nanoscale particles that display the ability to change their geometrical, physical, chemical, and other attributes. In many ways, dynamic assemblies can represent a bottleneck in the "bottom-up" fabrication of NP-based devices because they can produce a much greater variety of assemblies, but they also provide a convenient tool for variation of geometries and dimensions of nanoparticle assemblies.Superstructures of NPs (and those held together by similar intrinsic forces)are classified into two groups: Class 1 where media and external fields can alter shape, conformation, and order of stable super structures with a nearly constant number of NPs or Class 2 where the total number of NPs changes, while the organizational motif in the final superstructure remains the same. The future development of successful dynamic assemblies requires understanding the equilibrium in dynamic NP systems. The dynamic nature of Class 1 assemblies is associated with the equilibrium between different conformations of a superstructure and is comparable to the isomerization in classical chemistry. Class 2 assemblies involve the formation or breakage of linkages between the NPs, which is analogous to the classical chemical equilibrium for the formation of a molecule from atoms. Finer classification of NP assemblies in accord with established conventions in the field may include different size dimensionalities: discrete assemblies (artificial molecules) and one-dimensional (spaced chains), two-dimensional (sheets), and three-dimensional (superlattices, twisted structures) assemblies. Notably, these dimensional attributes must be regarded as primarily topological in nature because all of these superstructures can acquire complex three-dimensional shapes.We discuss three primary strategies used to prepare NP superstructures: (1) anisotropy-based assemblies utilizing either intrinsic force field anisotropy around NPs or external anisotropy associated with templates or applied fields, (2) assembly methods utilizing uniform NPs with isotropic interactions, and (3) methods based on mutual recognition of biomolecules, such as DNA and antigen-antibody interactions.We consider optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of dynamic superstructures, focusing primarily on multiparticle effects in NP superstructures as represented by surface plasmon resonance, NP-NP charge transport, and multibody magnetization. Unique properties of NP superstructures are being applied to biosensing, drug delivery, and nanoelectronics. For both Class 1 and Class 2 dynamic assemblies, biosensing is the most dominant and well-developed area of dynamic nanostructures being successfully transitioned into practice. We can foresee the rapid development of dynamic NP assemblies toward applications in harvesting of dissipated energy, photonics, and electronics. The final part of this Account is devoted to the fundamental questions facing dynamic assemblies of NPs in the future. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

Nucleic-acid aptamers, obtained through in vitro selection and amplification, are artificial single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences that could bind to a wide range of targets with extremely high specificity and stability.

84866373911	Self-assembly of chiral nanoparticle pyramids with strong R/S optical activity	Chirality at the nanometer scale represents one of the most rapidly developing areas of research. Self-assembly of DNA-nanoparticle (NP) hybrids enables geometrically precise assembly of chiral isomers. The concept of a discrete chiral nanostructure of tetrahedral shape and topology fabricated from four different NPs located in the corners of the pyramid is fundamental to the field. While the first observations of optical activity of mixed pyramidal assemblies were made in 2009 (Chen, W.; Nano Lett. 2009, 9, 2153-2159), further studies are difficult without finely resolved optical data for precisely organized NP pyramidal enantiomers.

84872725626	Determination of ten aminoglycoside residues in milk and dairy products using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	A high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analytical method was developed for the simultaneous determination of ten aminoglycoside residues (streptomycin, dihydrostrepmycin, neomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamycin, apramycin, hygromycin B, paromomycin, and amkacin) in milk and dairy products. The sample was extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid aqueous solution, then the extract was purified by a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge. The ten aminoglycoside residues were separated by ion-pair reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Heptafluorobutyric acid was used as ion pair agent due to its volatility. Then the analytes were detected by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The pretreatment condition of the sample, the HPLC condition and the MS operation parameters were optimized. The results showed that the linearities of the ten aminoglycoside residues in 20 -1 000 μg/L had the correlation coefficient between 0. 994 6 - 0. 999 7. The recoveries ranged from 71. 2% and 101. 7% with the relative standard deviations of 3. 4% - 13. 8%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of the mass concentrations of the analytes in related samples, which provides a simple, and convenient method for the quality control of milk and dairy products. Furthermore, this method is effective for the safety monitoring of aminoglycoside residues in milk and dairy products.

84872346022	Shape evolution and thermal stability of lysozyme crystals: Effect of pH and temperature	The properties of crystalline protein materials are closely linked to crystal shape. However, the effective strategies for the shape control of protein crystals are lacking. The conventional sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed to investigate the influence of pH and temperature on the crystal nucleation behavior of hen egg white lysozyme. Moreover, the size distributions of protein crystals grown at different conditions were analyzed. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of lysozyme crystals. The results indicated that pH and temperature will affect the supersaturation and electrostatic interactions among protein molecules in the nucleation process. In particular, the crystals with different aspect ratios can be selectively nucleated, depending upon the choice of pH and temperature. Therefore, this study provided a simple method for obtaining shape-controlled lysozyme crystals and supplied some information on thermal behaviors of lysozyme crystals grown at different pH values. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84873738019	Interaction between lysozyme and procyanidin: Multilevel structural nature and effect of carbohydrates	The interaction of procyanidins with proteins has aroused extensive attention due to its important relationship with the bioavailability and astringent property of polyphenols. In the present work, we have investigated the interactions of lysozyme with procyanidin dimer (B3) using various biophysical approaches, which aims to provide insights into the mechanism of protein/polyphenol aggregation. Procyanidin B3 spontaneously binds lysozyme, inducing the multilevel structural changes in lysozyme and the formation of insoluble complexes. The relationship between lysozyme aggregation and the loss of enzymatic activity was monitored using dynamic light scattering and fluorescence quenching. The influences of two carbohydrates (gum arabic and sucrose) on lysozyme/B3 aggregation were also studied. Gum arabic effectively inhibited the formation of insoluble aggregates, but was unable to restore the fluorescence and activity of lysozyme. However, sucrose concomitantly decreased the aggregate size with the recovery of fluorescence and lysozyme activity. These results proposed two probable mechanisms by which these two carbohydrates inhibit protein/polyphenol aggregation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84874157674	Alternating plasmonic nanoparticle heterochains made by polymerase chain reaction and their optical properties	Organization of nanoparticles (NPs) of different materials into superstructures of higher complexity represents a key challenge in nanotechnology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in this study to fabricate chains consisting of plasmonic NPs of different sizes, thus denoted heterochains. The NPs in such chains are connected by DNA oligomers, alternating in a sequence big-small-big-small-... and spanning lengths in the range of 40-300 nm by varying the number of PCR cycles. They display strong plasmonic chirality at 500-600 nm, the chiral activity revealing nonmonotonous dependence on the length of heterochains. We find the strength of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to increase with chain length, while the chiral response initially increased and then decreased with the number of PCR cycles. The relationship between the optical properties of the heterochains and their structure/length is discussed. The length-dependent intense optical response of the plasmonic NP heterochains holds great potential for biosensing applications. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

With two monoclonal antibodies, which recognize different antigenic determinant on the surface of Salmonella, we prepared antibody-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and conjugates of QDs-Ab. The immune-magnetic beads were verified with high enrichment efficiency for Salmonella (90%). A sandwich structure formed if the Salmonella solution was mixed together with immune-beads and QDs-Ab, and the fluorescent single from QDs was related to the amount of Salmonella. A linear response between fluorescence intensity and various concentrations of Salmonella (2.5 × 103 to 1.95 × 108 cfu mL-1) were observed with this proposed method. The total assay time for Salmonella was 30 min, and no cross-reaction to other microbial strains, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7), were found using this detection system.

In this article, we introduce the use of an amphiphilic dipeptide derivative, aspartame, as an effective dispersing agent in preparing highly stable suspensions under ultrasonication. The results demonstrate that aspartame was absorbed by the nanotube surface possibly because of non-covalent π-π stacking between the aromatic group of aspartame and the CNT backbone. In addition, the resulting MWCNT/aspartame composites remained stably dispersed over a wide range of pH values. The chronoamperometric measurements of MWCNT/aspartame composite-coated electrodes for hydrogen peroxide demonstrated better electrochemical detection performance, as characterized by significantly enhanced step current, higher sensitivity, and reduced potential compared with bare electrodes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Methods: DNA was extracted from each sample as template, the ITS2 region was amplified by PCR technology and sequenced bidirectionally using DNA cloning sequencing method. The sequence assembly and consensus sequence generation were performed using the Seqman program. Phylogenetic study was performed by MEGA 4.1, and the Nighbor-joining (NJ) dendrogram was constructed. The ITS2 secondary structure was predicted using the ITS2 website. Results: The maximum Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) genetic distance of E. ulmoides was far lower than the minimum K2P genetic distance of the adulterants. In the cluster dendrogram, E. ulmoides samples from various sources showed the monophyletic and simultaneously distinguished from the adulterants. To compare the ITS2 secondary structure, it could be noticed that ITS2 secondary structure could distinguish E. ulmoides from its adulterants in terms of numbers, sizes, positions of loop, and the angles of helix exsertion in four helix regions. Conclusion: ITS2 barcode could be used to distinguish E. ulmoides from its adulterants effectively, and provide the important molecular evidence for the identification of germplasm rescouces and clinic safety in medicinal use.

84888635518	Nanoscale superstructures assembled by polymerase chain reaction (PCR): Programmable construction, structural diversity, and emerging applications	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an essential tool in biotechnology laboratories and is becoming increasingly important in other areas of research. Extensive data obtained over the last 12 years has shown that the combination of PCR with nanoscale dispersions can resolve issues in the preparation DNA-based materials that include both inorganic and organic nanoscale components. Unlike conventional DNA hybridization and antibody-antigen complexes, PCR provides a new, effective assembly platform that both increases the yield of DNA-based nanomaterials and allows researchers to program and control assembly with predesigned parameters including those assisted and automated by computers. As a result, this method allows researchers to optimize to the combinatorial selection of the DNA strands for their nanoparticle conjugates.We have developed a PCR approach for producing various nanoscale assemblies including organic motifs such as small molecules, macromolecules, and inorganic building blocks, such as nanorods (NRs), metal, semiconductor, and magnetic nanoparticles (NPs). We start with a nanoscale primer and then modify that building block using the automated steps of PCR-based assembly including initialization, denaturation, annealing, extension, final elongation, and final hold. The intermediate steps of denaturation, annealing, and extension are cyclic, and we use computer control so that the assembled superstructures reach their predetermined complexity. The structures assembled using a small number of PCR cycles show a lower polydispersity than similar discrete structures obtained by direct hybridization between the nanoscale building blocks. Using different building blocks, we assembled the following structural motifs by PCR: (1) discrete nanostructures (NP dimers, NP multimers including trimers, pyramids, tetramers or hexamers, etc.), (2) branched NP superstructures and heterochains, (3) NP satellite-like superstructures, (4) Y-shaped nanostructures and DNA networks, (5) protein-DNA co-assembly structures, and (6) DNA block copolymers including trimers and pentamers. These results affirm that this method can produce a variety of chemical structures and in yields that are tunable.Using PCR-based preparation of DNA-bridged nanostructures, we can program the assembly of the nanoscale blocks through the adjustment of the primer intensity on the assembled units, the number of PCR cycles, or both. The resulting structures are highly complex and diverse and have interesting dynamics and collective properties. Potential applications of these materials include chirooptical materials, probe fabrication, and environmental and biomedical sensors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84890489741	Unexpected chirality of nanoparticle dimers and ultrasensitive chiroplasmonic bioanalysis	Chiral assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) are typically constructed with helical or tetrahedral geometries. Simple pairs of NPs are not expected to display chirality due to basic symmetry considerations made under the assumption of their spherical geometry. In this study we demonstrate that assemblies consisting of two metallic NPs do possess chirality and strongly rotate polarization of light. Their chiroplasmonic properties are attributed to the prolate geometry of individual colloidal particles. When bridged by biomolecules, the NP pairs acquire scissor-like geometry, with the long axes of NPs forming an angle of ∼9. This small dihedral angle results in chirality of the NP pair, while the consistency of its sign due to the specific conformation of the bridging biomacromolecules breaks the enantiomeric equivalence of the NP pairs. Strong polarization rotation in these nanoassemblies makes possible their utilization in biological analysis. Heterodimers of gold and silver NPs were made using antibody-antigen bridges. Taking advantage of their chiroplasmonic properties, we investigated their bioanalitical potential for detection of an environmental toxin, microcystin-LR, and a cancer biomarker, prostate-specific antigen. The order-of-magnitude improvements in limits of detection compared to all other analytical techniques are attributed to plasmonic enhancement of intrinsic chirality of biological compounds, strong optical coupling of photons with NP assemblies with twisted geometries, and signal amplification due to the bisignate nature of circular dichroism bands. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84890502845	Attomolar DNA detection with chiral nanorod assemblies	Nanoscale plasmonic assemblies display exceptionally strong chiral optical activity. So far, their structural design was primarily driven by challenges related to metamaterials whose practical applications are remote. Here we demonstrate that gold nanorods assembled by the polymerase chain reaction into DNA-bridged chiral systems have promising analytical applications. The chiroplasmonic activity of side-by-side assembled patterns is attributed to a 7-9 degree twist between the nanorod axes. This results in a strong polarization rotation that matches theoretical expectations. The amplitude of the bisignate 'wave' in the circular dichroism spectra of side-by-side assemblies demonstrates excellent linearity with the amount of target DNA. The limit of detection for DNA using side-by-side assemblies is as low as 3.7 aM. The chiroplasmonic method may be particularly useful for biological analytes larger than 2-5 nm which are difficult to detect by methods based on plasmon coupling and 'hot spots'. Circular polarization increases for inter-nanorod gaps between 2 and 20 nm when plasmonic coupling rapidly decreases. Reaching the attomolar limit of detection for simple and reliable bioanalysis of oligonucleotides may have a crucial role in DNA biomarker detection for early diagnostics of different diseases, forensics and environmental monitoring. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
