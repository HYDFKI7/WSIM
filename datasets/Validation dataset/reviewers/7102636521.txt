15244350269	Using complexity measure factor to predict protein subcellular location	Recent advances in large-scale genome sequencing have led to the rapid accumulation of amino acid sequences of proteins whose functions are unknown. Because the functions of these proteins are closely correlated with their subcellular localizations, it is vitally important to develop an automated method as a high-throughput tool to timely identify their subcellular location. Based on the concept of the pseudo amino acid composition by which a considerable amount of sequence-order effects can be incorporated into a set of discrete numbers (Chou, K. C., Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 2001, 43: 246-255), the complexity measure approach is introduced. The advantage by incorporating the complexity measure factor as one of the pseudo amino acid components for a protein is that it can more effectively reflect its overall sequence-order feature than the conventional correlation factors. With such a formulation frame to represent the samples of protein sequences, the covariant-discriminant predictor (Chou, K. C. and Elrod, D. W., Protein Engineering, 1999, 12: 107-118) was adopted to conduct prediction. High success rates were obtained by both the jackknife cross-validation test and independent dataset test, suggesting that introduction of the concept of the complexity measure into prediction of protein subcellular location is quite promising, and might also hold a great potential as a useful vehicle for the other areas of molecular biology. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

15244357858	Using cellular automata to generate image representation for biological sequences	A novel approach to visualize biological sequences is developed based on cellular automata (Wolfram, S. Nature 1984, 311, 419-424), a set of discrete dynamical systems in which space and time are discrete. By transforming the symbolic sequence codes into the digital codes, and using some optimal space-time evolvement rules of cellular automata, a biological sequence can be represented by a unique image, the so-called cellular automata image. Many important features, which are originally hidden in a long and complicated biological sequence, can be clearly revealed thru its cellular automata image. With biological sequences entering into databanks rapidly increasing in the post-genomic era, it is anticipated that the cellular automata image will become a very useful vehicle for investigation into their key features, identification of their function, as well as revelation of their "fingerprint". It is anticipated that by using the concept of the pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, K.C. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 2001, 43, 246-255), the cellular automata image approach can also be used to improve the quality of predicting protein attributes, such as structural class and subcellular location. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

15744367542	Digital coding for amino acid based on Cellular Automata	With the development of bioinformatics, it is a valuable subject to study the biological sequence on the protein aspect with the computer based on the threshold of encoding 20 kinds of amino acids, because many biological phenotype characters, gene regulating control network are determined by amino acids sequence. It is feasible to analyze genetic signals in amino acid sequences because there are already a lot of mature information process systems. This paper makes use of similarity rule, complementaity rule, molecular recognition theory, and information theory to set up a model of digital coding for amino acids. The model reflects better amino acid chemical physical properties and degeneracy. It transforms the symbolic DNA sequences into digital genetic signals of amino acids and offers the possibility to utilize Cellular Automata. Correspondingly, it opens the possibility to apply a whole range of powerful signal processing methods for analysis of amino acids. © 2004 IEEE.

20344364176	An application of gene comparative image for predicting the effect on replication ratio by HBV virus gene missense mutation	Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) show instantaneous and high-ratio mutations when they are replicated, some sorts of which significantly affect the efficiency of virus replication through enhancing or depressing the viral replication, while others have no influence at all. The mechanism of gene expression is closely correlated with its gene sequence. With the rapid increase in the number of newly found sequences entering into data banks, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method for simulating the gene regulating function. The establishment of such a predictor will no doubt expedite the process of prioritizing genes and proteins identified by genomics efforts as potential molecular targets for drug design. Based on the power of cellular automata (CA) in treating complex systems with simple rules, a novel method to present HBV gene image has been introduced. The results show that the images thus obtained can very efficiently simulate the effects of the gene missense mutation on the virus replication. It is anticipated that CA may also serve as a useful vehicle for many other studies on complicated biological systems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0032642558	Comparison of necessary conditions for typical Takagi-Sugeno and Mamdani fuzzy systems as universal approximators	Both Takagi-Sugeno (TS) and Mamdani fuzzy systems are known to be universal approximators. In this paper, we investigate whether one type of the fuzzy approximators is more economical than the other type. The TS fuzzy systems in this study are the typical two-input single-output TS fuzzy systems: they employ trapezoidal or triangular input fuzzy sets, arbitrary fuzzy rules with linear rule consequent, product fuzzy logic AND, and the centroid defuzzifier. We first establish necessary conditions on minimal system configuration of the TS fuzzy systems as function approximators. We show that the number of the input fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules needed by the TS fuzzy systems depend on the number and locations of the extrema of the function to be approximated. The resulting conditions reveal the strength of the TS fuzzy approximators: only a handful of fuzzy rules may be needed to approximate functions that have complicated formulation but a few extrema. The drawback, though, is that a large number of fuzzy rules must be employed to approximate periodic or highly oscillatory functions. We then compare these necessary conditions with the ones that we established for the general Mamdani fuzzy systems in our previous papers. Results of the comparison unveil that the minimal system configurations of the TS and Mamdani fuzzy systems are comparable. Finally, we prove that the minimal configuration of the TS fuzzy systems can be reduced and becomes smaller than that of the Mamdani fuzzy systems if nontrapezoidal or nontriangular input fuzzy sets are used. We believe that all the results in present paper hold for the TS fuzzy systems with more than two input variables but the proof seems to be mathematically difficult. Our new findings are valuable in designing more compact fuzzy systems, especially fuzzy controllers and models which are two most popular and successful applications of the fuzzy approximators.

33645081708	A novel fingerprint map for detecting SARS-CoV	Spike (S) protein is the most important membrane protein on the surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It associates with cellular receptors to mediate infection of their target cells. Inspired by such a mechanism, an in-depth investigation into the genome sequences of S protein of SARS-CoV and its receptor are conducted thru a mathematical transformation and graphic approach. As an outcome, a novel method for visualizing the characteristic of SARS-CoV is suggested. An extensive comparison among a large number of genome sequences has proved that the characteristic thus revealed is unique for SARS-CoV. As such, the characteristic can be regarded as the fingerprint map of SARS-CoV for diagnostic usage. Moreover, the conclusion has been further supported in a real case in Guangdong province of China. The fingerprint map proposed here has the merits of clear visibility and reliability that can serve as a complementary clinical tool for detecting SARS-CoV, particularly for the cases where the results obtained by the conventional methods are uncertain or conflicted with each other. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33645647648	Application of FAHP and artificial neural network on clothing plant location	Clothing manufacturers' direct investment and joint ventures in developing regions have seen to grow rapidly in the past few decades. Non-optimized selection can contribute to adverse effects affecting the performance of the plants on aspects of productivity, manufacturing and logistics cost. Selection of proper plant location is thus crucial. The conventional approaches to sites location are based on the factors and their weights. However, determining the weight of each factor is very difficult and time consuming. While the situation is changed, all the work must be redone again. This study aims to develop a decision-making system on clothing plant location for Hong Kong clothing manufacturer. The proposed system utilizes artificial neural network to study the relationship between the factors and the suitability index of candidate sites. Firstly, the factors are stratified using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) by review the related references and interviewing the experts. Secondly, the corresponding data are collected from the experts by questionnaire and the related government publication. Finally, the feedforward neural network with error back-propagation (EBP) learning algorithm is trained and applied to make decision. The results show that the proposed system performs well and has the characteristic of adaptability and plasticity.

In the control scheme, the change in rotor time constant was regarded as the inner disturbance of the flux subsystem, the effect of the change in rotor flux linkage amplitude and that of load as the inner and exterior disturbances of the rotate speed subsystem respectively, and the extended state of an extended state observer (ESO) was used for estimation and compensation. The control scheme can solve such problems as the effect of time-varying parameter on the decoupling performance of a vector control system and the contradiction between speediness and stability in common vector control systems. Simulated results indicated the rationality and validity of the scheme above-mentioned.

0033086690	Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy PID gain-scheduling controllers	This paper aims at Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy controllers as gain scheduling (GS) schemes of PID controllers. A TS fuzzy controller employs arbitrary input fuzzy sets, product or Zadeh fuzzy logic AND, TS fuzzy rules with linear consequent, and the generalized defuzzifier containing the popular centroid defuzzifier as a special case. The relationship between the TS fuzzy controller and the linear PID controller is established. The TS fuzzy controller is accurately a nonlinear PID controller with gains continuously changing with its process output. Then the TS fuzzy controller is pointed out to be closely related to the traditional gain scheduler. The gains of the TS fuzzy controller are determined by three two-input-one-output fuzzy systems with singleton output fuzzy sets. Finally, as a demonstration, a simple TS fuzzy controller employing two linear input fuzzy sets, Zadeh fuzzy logic AND, and the popular controlled defuzzifier is designed to be the gain scheduler for the PID controller. Computer simulation results show that the TS fuzzy controller outperforms Ziegler-Nichols' and Kitamori's PID controllers.

However, it is very difficult to establish such a desired predictor by acquiring the key statistical information buried in a pile of extremely complicated and highly variable sequences.

Many important features, which are originally hidden in the long amino acid sequences, can be clearly displayed through their cellular automata images.

33644889341	Using pseudo amino acid composition to predict protein structural classes: Approached with complexity measure factor	The structural class is an important feature widely used to characterize the overall folding type of a protein. How to improve the prediction quality for protein structural classification by effectively incorporating the sequence-order effects is an important and challenging problem. Based on the concept of the pseudo amino acid composition [Chou, K. C. Proteins Struct Funct Genet 2001, 43, 246; Erratum: Proteins Struct Funct Genet 2001, 44, 60], a novel approach for measuring the complexity of a protein sequence was introduced. The advantage by incorporating the complexity measure factor into the pseudo amino acid composition as one of its components is that it can catch the essence of the overall sequence pattern of a protein and hence more effectively reflect its sequence-order effects. It was demonstrated thru the jackknife crossvalidation test that the overall success rate by the new approach was significantly higher than those by the others. It has not escaped our notice that the introduction of the complexity measure factor can also be used to improve the prediction quality for, among many other protein attributes, subcellular localization, enzyme family class, membrane protein type, and G-protein couple receptor type. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33344460430	A probability cellular automaton model for hepatitis B viral infections	The existing models of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection dynamics are based on the assumption that the populations of viruses and cells are uniformly mixed. However, the real virus infection system is actually not homogeneous and some spatial factors might play a nontrivial role in governing the development of HBV infection and its outcome. For instance, the localized populations of dead cells might adversely affect the spread of infection. To consider this kind of inhomogeneous feature, a simple 2D (dimensional) probability Cellular Automaton model was introduced to study the dynamic process of HBV infection. The model took into account the existence of different types of HBV infectious and non-infectious particles. The simulation results thus obtained showed that the Cellular Automaton model could successfully account for some important features of the disease, such as its wide variety in manifestation and its age dependency. Meanwhile, the effects of the model's parameters on the dynamical process of the infection were also investigated. It is anticipated that the Cellular Automaton model may be extended to serve as a useful vehicle for studying, among many other complicated dynamic biological systems, various persistent infections with replicating parasites. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

0034944518	Automatic design of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers by a new DNA-based evolutionary algorithm	In this paper, we propose a new approach to DNA-based evolutionary algorithm (DNA-EA) to design automatically a class of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy controllers. The fuzzy controllers employ TS fuzzy rules with linear consequent, continuous input fuzzy sets, Zadeh fuzzy logic AND operation, and the widely-used centroid defuzzier. The fuzzy controllers are proved to be nonlinear PI controllers with variable gains. The fuzzy rules are automatically discovered, and the design parameters in the input fuzzy sets and the linear rule consequent are optimized simultaneously by the DNA-EA. The DNA-EA uses the DNA encoding method stemmed from the structure of the biological DNA to encode the design parameters of the fuzzy controllers. The gene transfer operation and bacterial mutation operation inspired by a microbial evolution phenomenon are introduced into the DNA-EA. Moreover, frameshift mutation operations based on the DNA genetic operations are also used in the DNA-EA. Our encoding method is suitable for complex knowledge representation, and is easy for the genetic operations at gene level to be introduced into the DNA-EA. The length of the chromosome is variable and it is easy to insert and delete parts of the chromosome. As a demonstration, we show how to implement the new method to design automatically a TS fuzzy controller in the control of a nonlinear system. The fuzzy controller can be automatically constructed by the DNA-EA. Computer simulation results indicate that the new method is effective and the designed fuzzy controller is satisfactory.

This characteristic introduces the obstacles for respondent in project assessment. In order to overcome the issue, we invited trapezoidal fuzzy theory in obtaining criteria weights and AHP in ranking. Several programming schemes were evaluated on the basis of this method and it is testified to be simple, scientific and applicable.

50949100896	Mining high utility itemsets in large high dimensional data	Existing algorithms for utility mining are inadequate on datasets with high dimensions or long patterns. This paper proposes a hybrid method, which is composed of a row enumeration algorithm (i.e., Inter-transaction) and a column enumeration algorithm (i.e., Two-phase), to discover high utility itemsets from two directions: Two-phase seeks short high utility itemsets from the bottom, while Intertransaction seeks long high utility itemsets from the top. In addition, optimization technique is adopted to improve the performance of computing the intersection of transactions. Experiments on synthetic data show that the hybrid method achieves high performance in large high dimensional datasets. © 2008 IEEE.

Based on the mechanism of the bio-subsistence and the bio-migration, this paper proposes a novel algorithm - Living Migration Algorithm (LMA). The original contributions of LMA are three essential attributes of each individual: the minimal life-needs which are the necessaries for survival, the migrating which is a basal action for searching new living space, and the judging which is an important ability of deciding whether to migrate or not. When living space of all individuals can satisfy the minimal life-needs at some generation, they are considered as the optimal living places where objective functions will obtain the optima. LMA may be employed in large-scale computation and engineering field. The paper mostly operates LMA to deal with four non-linear and heterogeneous optimizations, and experiments prove LMA has better performances than Free Search algorithm.

56349121099	Mining crime data by using new similarity measure	Clustering technique was introduced to the field of crime data analysis for finding crime suspects, but compared with the high requirements for public security work, traditional clustering methods used in existing application systems provide a relatively low accuracy. To solve the problem, we proposed a new similarity measure method, i.e., Segmented Multiple Metric Similarity Measure (SMMSM), to improve the accuracy of similarity measure. In our method, attributes are divided into different groups according to their importance to similarity, compensation relationships does not exist among attributes in different groups. The new measure is scalable with dimensionality of data and is both suitable for numeric data and categorical data. Experiments on real data show that our method has higher accuracy than other measures. © 2008 IEEE.

70249119593	A hybrid method for high-utility itemsets mining in large high-dimensional data	Existing algorithms for high-utility itemsets mining are column enumeration based, adopting an Apriorilike candidate set generation-and-test approach, and thus are inadequate in datasets with high dimensions or long patterns. To solve the problem, this paper proposed a hybrid model and a row enumeration-based algorithm, i.e., Inter-transaction, to discover high-utility itemsets from two directions: an existing algorithm can be used to seek short high-utility itemsets from the bottom, while Inter-transaction can be used to seek long high-utility itemsets from the top. Inter-transaction makes full use of the characteristic that there are few common items between or among long transactions. By intersecting relevant transactions, the new algorithm can identify long high-utility itemsets, without extending short itemsets step by step. In addition, we also developed new pruning strategies and an optimization technique to improve the performance of Inter-transaction. © 2009.

0034503980	Necessary conditions on minimal system configuration for general MISO Mamdani fuzzy systems as universal approximators	Recent studies have shown that both Mamdani-type and Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy systems are universal approximators in that they can uniformly approximate continuous functions defined on compact domains with arbitrarily high approximation accuracy. In this paper, we investigate necessary conditions for general multiple-input single-output (MISO) Mamdani fuzzy systems as universal approximators with as minimal system configuration as possible. The general MISO fuzzy systems employ almost arbitrary continuous input fuzzy sets, arbitrary singleton output fuzzy sets, arbitrary fuzzy rules, product fuzzy logic AND, and the generalized defuzzifier containing the popular centroid defuzzifier as a special case. Our necessary conditions are developed under the practically sensible assumption that only a finite set of extrema of the multivariate continuous function to be approximated is available. We have first revealed a decomposition property of the general fuzzy systems: A r-input fuzzy system can always be decomposed to the sum of r simpler fuzzy systems where the first system has only one input variable, the second one two input variables, and the last one r input variables. Utilizing this property, we have derived some necessary conditions for the fuzzy systems to be universal approximators with minimal system configuration. The conditions expose the strength as well as limitation of the fuzzy approximation: 1) only a small number of fuzzy rules may be needed to uniformly approximate multivariate continuous functions that have a complicated formulation but a relatively small number of extrema; and 2) the number of fuzzy rules must be large in order to approximate highly oscillatory continuous functions. A numerical example is given to demonstrate our new results.

0037337048	Emergence of self-learning fuzzy systems by a new virus DNA-based evolutionary algorithm	In this article, we propose a new approach to the virus DNA-based evolutionary algorithm (VDNA-EA) to implement self-learning of a class of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controllers. The fuzzy controllers use T-S fuzzy rules with linear consequent, the generalized input fuzzy sets, Zadeh fuzzy logic and operators, and the generalized defuzzifier. The fuzzy controllers are proved to be nonlinear proportional-integral (PI) controllers with variable gains. The fuzzy rules are discovered automatically and the design parameters in the input fuzzy sets and the linear rule consequent are optimized simultaneously by the VDNA-EA. The VDNA-EA uses the VDNA encoding method that stemmed from the structure of the VDNA to encode the design parameters of the fuzzy controllers. We use the frameshift decoding method of the VDNA to decode the DNA chromosome into the design parameters of the fuzzy controllers. In addition, the gene transfer operation and bacterial mutation operation inspired by a microbial evolution phenomenon are introduced into the VDNA-EA. Moreover, frameshift mutation operations based on the DNA genetic operations are used in the VDNA-EA to add and delete adaptively fuzzy rules. Our encoding method can significantly shorten the code length of the DNA chromosomes and improve the encoding efficiency. The length of the chromosome is variable and it is easy to insert and delete parts of the chromosome. It is suitable for complex knowledge representation and is easy for the genetic operations at gene level to be introduced into the VDNA-EA. We show how to implement the new method to self-learn a T-S fuzzy controller in the control of a nonlinear system. The fuzzy controller can be constructed automatically by the VDNA-EA. Computer simulation results indicate that the new method is effective and the designed fuzzy controller is satisfactory. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0037402613	Typical Takagi-Sugeno PI and PD fuzzy controllers: Analytical structures and stability analysis	In the first part of this paper, we investigate explicit structure of the typical Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy PI and PD controllers. By typical, we mean the use of at least three trapezoidal or triangular input fuzzy sets for each input variable, fuzzy rules with linear consequent, Zadeh fuzzy logic AND operator and the centroid defuzzifier. This configuration covers many TS fuzzy controllers in the literature. We mathematically prove these fuzzy controllers to be nonlinear PI (or PD) controllers with proportional-gain and integral-gain (or derivative-gain) changing with output of the controlled system. We reveal these fuzzy controllers to be inherently nonlinear gain scheduling PI (or PD) controllers with different variable gains in different regions of input space. The gains constantly change even in the same region, and switch continuously and smoothly between adjacent regions. The explicit structural expressions of the fuzzy controllers are derived and their characteristics, including the bounds and geometrical shape of the gain variation, are studied. In the second part of the paper, we apply the Small Gain Theorem to the derived structures of the fuzzy controllers and establish a sufficient global BIBO stability criterion for nonlinear systems controlled by the fuzzy controllers. Local stability is also examined. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.
