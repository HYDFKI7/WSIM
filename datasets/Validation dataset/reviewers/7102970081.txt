84930326469	Delivery of Human EV71 Receptors by Adeno-Associated Virus Increases EV71 Infection-Induced Local Inflammation in Adult Mice	Enterovirus71 (EV71) is now recognized as an emerging neurotropic virus in Asia and one major causative agent of hand-foot-mouth diseases (HFMD). However potential animal models for vaccine development are limited to young mice. In this study, we used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to introduce the human EV71 receptors P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (hPSGL1) or a scavenger receptor class-B member-2 (hSCARB2) into adult ICR mice to change their susceptibility to EV71 infection. Mice were administered AAV-hSCARB2 or AAV-hPSGL1 through intravenous and oral routes. After three weeks, expression of human SCARB2 and PSGL1 was detected in various organs. After infection with EV71, we found that the EV71 viral load in AAV-hSCARB2- or AAV-hPSGL1-transduced mice was higher than that of the control mice in both the brain and intestines. The presence of EV71 viral particles in tissues was confirmed using immunohistochemistry analysis. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines were induced in the brain and intestines of AAV-hSCARB2- or AAV-hPSGL1-transduced mice after EV71 infection but not in wild-type mice. However, neurological disease was not observed in these animals. Taken together, we successfully infected adult mice with live EV71 and induced local inflammation using an AAV delivery system.

0029887660	Identification of domains in rubella virus genomic RNA and capsid protein necessary for specific interaction	In rubella virus-infected cells, genomic 40S and subgenomic 24S RNAs are present in the cytoplasm of infected cells. However, encapsidation by rubella virus capsid protein is specific for 40S genomic RNA. As a first step toward understanding the assembly of rubella virus nucleocapsid at the molecular level, the interaction between capsid protein and genomic RNA was studied by Northwestern (RNA-protein) blot analysis. RNA probes prepared by in vitro transcription were used to localize the RNA sequence that participates in binding to the capsid protein. We have identified a 29-nucleotide RNA sequence (nucleotides 347 to 375) that is essential for the binding. By using overlapping synthetic peptides of capsid protein, a peptide domain (residues 28 to 56) that displays specific RNA-binding activity of capsid protein has been located. This result suggests that the specific recognition of viral RNA during rubella virus assembly involves, at least in part, the nucleocapsid protein.

34248993523	Identification of synthetic vaccine candidates against SARS CoV infection	Three peptides, D1 (amino acid residues 175-201), D2 (a.a. 434-467), and TM (a.a. 1128-1159), corresponding to the spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS CoV) were synthesized and their immunological functions were investigated in three different animals models (mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits). The peptides mixture formulated either with Freund's adjuvant or synthetic adjuvant Montanide ISA-51/oligodeoxy nucleotide CpG (ISA/CpG) could elicit antisera in immunized animals which were capable of inhibiting SARS/HIV pseudovirus entry into HepG2 cells. The neutralizing epitopes were identified using peptides to block the neutralizing effect of guinea pig antisera. The major neutralizing epitope was located on the D2 peptide, and the amino acid residue was fine mapped to 434-453. In BALB/c mice T-cell proliferation assay revealed that only D2 peptide contained T-cell epitope, the sequence of which corresponded to amino acid residue 434-448. The ISA/CpG formulation generated anti-D2 IgG titer comparable to those obtained from Freund's adjuvant formulation, but generated fewer antibodies against D1 or TM peptides. The highly immunogenic D2 peptide contains both neutralizing and Th cell epitopes. These results suggest that synthetic peptide D2 would be useful as a component of SARS vaccine candidates. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84867388819	Immunological Evaluation and Comparison of Different EV71 Vaccine Candidates	Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth diseases (HFMDs), and EV71 is now recognized as an emerging neurotropic virus in Asia. Effective medications and/or prophylactic vaccines against HFMD are not available. The current results from mouse immunogenicity studies using in-house standardized RD cell virus neutralization assays indicate that (1) VP1 peptide (residues 211225) formulated with Freund's adjuvant (CFA/IFA) elicited low virus neutralizing antibody response (1/32 titer); (2) recombinant virus-like particles produced from baculovirus formulated with CFA/IFA could elicit good virus neutralization titer (1/160); (3) individual recombinant EV71 antigens (VP1, VP2, and VP3) formulated with CFA/IFA, only VP1 elicited antibody response with 1/128 virus neutralization titer; and (4) the formalin-inactivated EV71 formulated in alum elicited antibodies that cross-neutralized different EV71 genotypes (1/640), but failed to neutralize CVA16. In contrast, rabbits antisera could cross-neutralize strongly against different genotypes of EV71 but weakly against CVA16, with average titers 1/6400 and 1/32, respectively. The VP1 amino acid sequence dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71 could partially explain why mouse antibodies failed to cross-neutralize CVA16. Therefore, the best formulation for producing cost-effective HFMD vaccine is a combination of formalin-inactivated EV71 and CAV16 virions. © 2012 Ai-Hsiang Chou et al.

84877836310	Mesenchymal stem cells tune the development of monocyte-derived dendritic cells toward a myeloid-derived suppressive phenotype through growth-regulated oncogene chemokines	Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are promising potential candidates for the treatment of immunological diseases because of their immunosuppressive functions. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate MSCs' immunosuppressive activity remain elusive. In this article, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, that secreted growth-regulated oncogene (GRO) chemokines, specifically GRO-γ, in human MSC-conditioned media have an effect on the differentiation and the function of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The monocyte-derived dendritic cells were driven toward a myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-like phenotype by the GRO chemokines. GRO-γ-treated MDSCs had a tolerogenic phenotype that was characterized by an increase in the secretion of IL-10 and IL-4, and a reduction in the production of IL-12 and IFN-γ. We have also shown that the mRNA expression levels of the arginase-1 and inducible NO synthase genes, which characterize MDSCs, were upregulated by GRO-γ-primed mouse bone marrow cells. In addition, the ability of GRO-γ-treated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to stimulate the OVA-specific CD8

84887469706	Formulation and immunological evaluation of a trivalent vaccine comprising emulsified submicron particles and inactivated virions of H5N1/EV71/JEV	Combination vaccines can reduce the number of injections and simplify the immunization schedule required to prevent different diseases. Here we assessed the immunogenicity in a mouse model of a vaccine composition comprising inactivated influenza viruses (H5N1/H1N1), enterovirus 71 (eV71), and/or Japanese encephalitis virus (JeV) and investigated whether the vaccine formulations can overcome the immunologic interference between the individual vaccine components. We demonstrated that the antigenic competition happens between H5N1/H1N1 or H5N1/eV71 inactivated virions when the vaccine combinations either formulated with alum suspensions or without adjuvant. In the presence of PeLc emulsified particles, eV71-specific immune responses before and after incorporating H5N1 virus into eV71 vaccine were detected of no significant difference; in addition, H5N1- and eV71-specific immune responses were found at the same level when H5N1/eV71/JeV consolidating into combination vaccine. emulsified vaccine formulation was represented as a potential tool that is found to reduce the number of injections required to prevent multiple infectious strains causing the same disease (H5N1/H1N1) and/or that protect against different diseases (H5N1/eV71). combination vaccines can also include a third component to protect against H5N1/eV71/JeV at the same time. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84897518877	A purified recombinant lipopeptide as adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy	Synthetic lipopeptides have been widely used as vaccine adjuvants to enhance immune responses. The present study demonstrated that the tryptic N-terminal fragment of the lipoprotein rlipo-D1E3 (lipo-Nter) induces superior antitumor effects compared to a synthetic lipopeptide. The lipo-Nter was purified and formulated with protein or peptide vaccines to determine if lipo-Nter could be used as a novel adjuvant and could induce antitumor immunity in a cervical cancer model. Purified lipo-Nter activated the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs), leading to the secretion of TNF-α through TLR2/6 but not TLR1/2. A recombinant mutant HPV16 E7 (rE7m) protein was mixed with lipo-Nter to immunize the mice; the anti-E7 antibody titers were increased, and the T helper cells were skewed toward the Th1 fate (increased IL-2 and decreased IL-5 secretion). Single-dose injection of rE7m and lipo-Nter inhibited tumor growth, but the injection of rE7m alone did not. Accordingly, lipo-Nter also enhanced the antitumor immunity of the E7-derived peptide but not the synthetic lipopeptide (Pam3CSK4). We demonstrated that the lipo-Nter of a bacterial-derived recombinant lipoprotein is a novel adjuvant that could be used for the development of a new generation of vaccines. © 2014 Ying-Chyi Song et al.

84907908055	Toll-like receptor 9-mediated protection of enterovirus 71 infection in mice is due to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns	Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a positive-stranded RNA virus, is the major cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) with severe neurological symptoms. Antiviral type I interferon (alpha/beta interferon [IFN-α/β]) responses initiated from innate receptor signaling are inhibited by EV71-encoded proteases. It is less well understood whether EV71-induced apoptosis provides a signal to activate type I interferon responses as a host defensive mechanism. In this report, we found that EV71 alone cannot activate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling, but supernatant from EV71-infected cells is capable of activating TLR9. We hypothesized that TLR9-activating signaling from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) may contribute to host defense mechanisms. To test our hypothesis, Flt3 ligand-cultured DCs (Flt3L-DCs) from both wild-type (WT) and TLR9 knockout (TLR9KO) mice were infected with EV71. More viral particles were produced in TLR9KO mice than by WT mice. In contrast, alpha interferon (IFN-α), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IFN-γ, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10 levels were increased in Flt3L-DCs from WT mice infected with EV71 compared with TLR9KO mice. Seven-day-old TLR9KO mice infected with a non-mouse-adapted EV71 strain developed neurological lesion-related symptoms, including hind-limb paralysis, slowness, ataxia, and lethargy, but WT mice did not present with these symptoms. Lung, brain, small intestine, forelimb, and hind-limb tissues collected from TLR9KO mice exhibited significantly higher viral loads than equivalent tissues collected from WT mice. Histopathologic damage was observed in brain, small intestine, forelimb, and hind-limb tissues collected from TLR9KO mice infected with EV71. Our findings demonstrate that TLR9 is an important host defense molecule during EV71 infection.

84907974648	Prospect and challenges for the development of multivalent vaccines against hand, foot and mouth diseases	Enterovirus 71 (EV71), an emerging neurotropic virus and coxsackieviruses (CV) are the major causative agents of hand, foot and mouth diseases (HFMD). These viruses have become a serious public health threat in the Asia Pacific region. Formalin-inactivated EV71 (FI-EV71) vaccines have been developed, evaluated in human clinical trials and were found to elicit full protection against EV71. Their failure to prevent CVA16 infections could compromise the acceptability of monovalent EV71 vaccines. Bivalent FI-EV71/FI-CVA16 vaccines have been found to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses against both viruses in animal models but did not protect against CVA6 and CVA10 viral infections in cell culture neutralization assay. In this review, we discuss the critical bottlenecks in the development of multivalent HFMD vaccines, including the selection of vaccine strains, animal models to assess vaccine potency, the definition of end-points for efficacy trials, and the need for improved manufacturing processes to produce affordable vaccines.

47649092816	DC-SIGN mediates avian H5N1 influenza virus infection in cis and in trans	DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin receptor expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), has been identified as a receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, and the SARS coronavirus. We used H5N1 pseudotyped and reverse-genetics (RG) virus particles to study their ability to bind with DC-SIGN. Electronic microscopy and functional assay results indicate that pseudotyped viruses containing both HA and NA proteins express hemagglutination and are capable of infecting cells expressing α-2,3-linked sialic acid receptors. Results from a capture assay show that DC-SIGN-expressing cells (including B-THP-1/DC-SIGN and T-THP-1/DC-SIGN) and peripheral blood dendritic cells are capable of transferring H5N1 pseudotyped and RG virus particles to target cells; this action can be blocked by anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies. In summary, (a) DC-SIGN acts as a capture or attachment molecule for avian H5N1 virus, and (b) DC-SIGN mediates infections in cis and in trans. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using microcarrier culture systems were established to produce inactivated whole-virus H5N1 vaccine. The current clade-1 influenza H5N1 vaccine virus (NIBRG-14) was provided by the UK National Institute for Biological Standards and Control.

59649115889	A novel dengue vaccine candidate that induces cross-neutralizing antibodies and memory immunity	A novel dengue vaccine candidate comprised of a consensus dengue virus envelope protein domain III (cED III) was developed to fight against dengue virus infection. The amino acid sequence of this novel cED III was obtained by alignment of amino acid sequences from different isolates of the four serotypes of dengue viruses. A proof-of-concept study demonstrated that BALB/c mice immunized with the recombinant cED III developed neutralizing antibodies against all serotypes of dengue virus. Moreover, formulation of recombinant cED III with aluminum phosphate could induce long-lasting antibody responses and anamnestic neutralizing antibody responses following challenge with dengue virus at week 28 after priming.

59649116879	A novel technology for the production of a heterologous lipoprotein immunogen in high yield has implications for the field of vaccine design	We have developed a novel platform technology that can express high levels of recombinant lipoproteins with intrinsic adjuvant properties. In this study, Ag473 (a lipoprotein from Neisseria meningitidis) can be produced in high yields using Escherichia coli strain C43 (DE3). After testing a non-lipoimmunogen (E3, from dengue virus) fused with different lipid signal peptides from other lipoproteins as well as Ag473 fragments of different lengths, we identified that the fusion sequence has to contain at least the N-terminal 40 residues, D1, of Ag473 to achieve high expression levels of the recombinant lipo-immunogen (rlipo-D1E3). The rlipo-D1E3 was found to elicit stronger anti-E3 and virus neutralizing antibody responses in animal studies than those from rE3 alone or rE3 formulated with alum adjuvant. These results have successfully demonstrated the merit of lipo-immunogens for novel vaccine development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

64749097242	Generating and characterizing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against avian H5N1 hemagglutinin protein	Accurate and timely diagnoses are central to H5N1 infection control. Here we describe the cloning and expression of the HA1 protein of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 strain in a bacterial system to generate mono-/polyclonal antibodies. All of the eight generated monoclonal antibodies recognized the same linear epitope on the top globular region of the HA structure-a highly conserved epitope among all circulating H5N1 clades identified by amino acid alignment. Results from immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting indicate that all monoclonal antibodies interacted with a denatured form of HA proteins, while the resultant polyclonal antibodies recognized both denatured and native HA proteins on H5N1 reverse-genetics (RG) viruses. Results from flow cytometry and microneutralization assays indicate that the polyclonal antibodies blocked viral binding and neutralized H5N1-RG viruses. Our results may prove useful to establishing future H5N1 mono-and polyclonal antibodies, and perhaps contribute to the development of an alternative H5N1 vaccine. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

64949197099	Immunological study of HA1 domain of hemagglutinin of influenza H5N1 virus	The neutralization titer of a hemagglutinin (HA)-specific neutralizing antibody against new isolates reflect both the antigenic drift and the conformation status of HA protein in these new influenza viruses. Since most antigenic sites are in the HA1 domain of HA, using HA1 domain of influenza virus as antigen is of great importance in vaccine development. In this study, we investigate different purification processes for optimizing the immunological properties of an Escherichia coli-expressed HA1 domain (rH5HA1) of influenza H5N1 virus. rH5HA1 was expressed as inclusion bodies and extracted with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl)/PBS buffer. The best condition for generating HA1-specific neutralization determinants is on-column oxidative refolding procedures with GSH/GSSG and l-arginine buffer. Others refolding procedures such as using high-pH buffer and/or different detergent solubilizations were found to be ineffective producing neutralization epitope recognized by a HA1-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody that was raised against H5N1 virus. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Physicochemical characterizations such as stability, a droplet test, microscopic aspects, and in vitro release showed that PEG-b-PLACLemulsified formulations have several advantages over traditional vaccine adjuvants in that they are stable, reproducible, and homogeneous fine particles with an appropriate size to facilitate the induction of potent immune responses. Different dispersion-type emulsions have provided different release profiles using ovalbumin in model studies. Immunogenicity studies in mice have shown that antigen-specific antibody titers and T-cell proliferative responses, as well as the secretion of IFN-γ, were significantly enhanced for ovalbumin after formulation with PEG-b-PLACL-based emulsions. These features are of great interest for applications in delivery systems of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine candidates. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

73549088284	Identification of HLA-A11-restricted CTL epitopes derived from HPV type 18 using DNA immunization	Identification of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of tumor antigens is important for effective immunotherapy. We report that a combination of epitope prediction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based epitope-HLA complex formation, and DNA immunization methods can improve the efficiency and accuracy of CTL epitope studies. In this study, two HLA-A11-restricted epitopes derived from human papillomavirus (HPV)18 E6 oncoprotein were identified. HLA-A11-transgenic mice immunized with these epitopes could specifically induce interferon-ã (IFNã) production, cytotoxicity and peptide/HLA-A11 tetramer binding in CD8+ T-cells. To study intracellular processing of CTL epitopes, we constructed a DNA plasmid containing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting sequence as well as the HPV18 E6 and E7 genes (pEK/HPV18E6E7). CTL responses against peptide-pulsed T2/A11 cells could be detected after immunizing HLA-A11-transgenic mice with pEK/HPV18E6E7. Furthermore, the identified peptides could stimulate T-cells to secrete IFNã from HPV18-infected patients. Our results demonstrate that the antigenic E6 peptides derived from HPV18 are potential candidates for the treatment of HPV 18-associated tumors in HLA-A11+ populations. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

The resulting poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-PEG diblock and PLA-PEG-PLA triblock copolymers were characterized by various analytical techniques, including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), gel permeation chromatography, and 1H-NMR. The molecular structure between PLA-PEG and PLA-PEG-PLA could be distinguished after the calculation of the repeat unit masses and end-group masses through the MALDI-TOF MS spectra. Interestingly, both copolymers could serve as a hydrophilic emulsifier to stabilize the squalene/water interfaces and yield narrowly distributed oil-in-water nanoparticles. In contrast, the prepolymer PEG failed to stabilize the squalene/water interface under the same homogenization conditions.

The tumor cell line, EG7, was transfected with a mammalian expression vector encoding the full length of murine IL-6 to mimic IL-6-secreting tumor cells. Two IL-6 transfectants with low and high IL-6 production were compared in vitro and in vivo. While the in vitro proliferation rates of both transfectants and the parental line were similar, high expression of IL-6 induced a significant reduction in tumor growth in vivo.

This study examined the T-cell response to HPV-58 L1, E6, and E7 peptides among women with cleared infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or CIN3, or invasive cervical cancer (ICC). Peptides found to be reactive in the in vitro peptide binding assay or mouse-stimulating study were tested with a gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to detect peptide-specific responses from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from 91 HPV-58-infected women (32 with cleared infection, 16 CIN2, 15 CIN3, and 28 ICC). Four HLA-A11-restricted HPV-58 L1 peptides, located at amino acid positions 296 to 304, 327 to 335, 101 to 109, and 469 to 477, showed positive IFN-γ ELISPOT results and were mainly from women with cleared infection. Two HLA-A11-restricted E6 peptides (amino acid positions 64 to 72 and 94 to 102) and three HLA-A11-restricted E7 peptides (amino acid positions 78 to 86, 74 to 82, and 88 to 96) showed a positive response. A response to E6 and E7 peptides was mainly observed from subjects with CIN2 or above. One HLA-A2-restricted E6 peptide, located at amino acid position 99 to 107, elicited a positive response in two CIN2 subjects. One HLA-A24-restricted L1 peptide, located at amino acid position 468 to 476, also elicited a positive response in two CIN2 subjects. In summary, this study has identified a few immunogenic epitopes for HPV-58 E6 and E7 proteins. It is worthwhile to further investigate whether responses to these epitopes have a role in clearing an established cervical lesion. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

77957906849	Emulsified nanoparticles containing inactivated influenza virus and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides critically influences the host immune responses in mice	Background: Antigen sparing and cross-protective immunity are regarded as crucial in pandemic influenza vaccine development. Both targets can be achieved by adjuvantation strategy to elicit a robust and broadened immune response. We assessed the immunogenicity of an inactivated H5N1 whole-virion vaccine (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14, clade 1) formulated with emulsified nanoparticles and investigated whether it can induce cross-clade protecting immunity. Methodology/Principal Findings: After formulation with PELC, a proprietary water-in-oil-in-water nanoemulsion comprising of bioresorbable polymer/Span®85/squalene, inactivated virus was intramuscularly administered to mice in either one-dose or two-dose schedule. We found that the antigen-specific serum antibody responses elicited after two doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine were lower than those observed after a single dose of adjuvanted vaccine, PELC and the conventional alum adjuvant as well. Moreover, 5 μg HA of PELC-formulated inactivated virus were capable of inducing higher antibodies than those obtained from alum-adjuvanted vaccine. In single-dose study, we found that encapsulating inactivated virus into emulsified PELC nanoparticles could induce better antibody responses than those formulated with PELC-adsorbed vaccine. However, the potency was rather reduced when the inactivated virus and CpG (an immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotide containing unmethylated cytosine-guanosine motifs) were co-encapsulated within the emulsion. Finally, the mice who received PELC/CpG(adsorption)-vaccine could easily and quickly reach 100% of seroprotection against a homologous virus strain and effective cross-protection against a heterologous virus strain (A/ Whooper swan/Mongolia/244/2005, clade 2.2). Conclusions/Significance: Encapsulating inactivated H5N1 influenza virus and CpG into emulsified nanoparticles critically influences the humoral responses against pandemic influenza. These results demonstrated that the use of PELC could be as antigen-sparing in preparation for a potential shortage of prophylactic vaccines against local infectious diseases, in particular pandemic influenza. Moreover, the cross-clade neutralizing antibody responses data verify the potential of such adjuvanted H5N1 candidate vaccine as an effective tool in pre-pandemic preparedness. © 2010 Huang et al.

78649655552	Biochemical characterizations of Escherichia coli-expressed protective antigen Ag473 of Neisseria meningitides group B	Polysaccharide-based vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) serogroups A, C, Y and W135 have been available since 1970, but similar vaccine candidates developed for Nm group B (NmB) have not been successful due to both poor immunogenicity and their potential immunological cross-reactivity with human neurological tissue. In previous reports, a protective antigen and vaccine candidate, Ag473, was identified using proteomics and NmB-specific bactericidal monoclonal antibody. To initiate human phase one clinical trials, antigen production and characterization, pre-clinical toxicology and animal studies are required. In the present study, we report the biochemical characterization of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant Ag473 (rAg473). Using MALDI-TOF mass analysis, chromatographically purified rAg473 was found to have two major isoforms that have molecular masses of 11,306 and 11,544 amu, respectively. The isoforms were separated using RP-HPLC and pooled into two fractions. Based on the chromatogram, the ratio of lipoproteins in fractions #1 and #2 was found to be 1-2. GC-MS analysis of lipoproteins was performed, and the acylated fatty acids were identified. The results indicated that the first lipoproteins in fraction #1 contained the lipids palmitic acid (C16:0), cyclopropaneoctanoic acid (C17:1) and, predominately, stearic acid (C18:0). A different lipid composition of cyclopropaneoctanoic acid (C17:1), oleic acid (C18:1) and, predominately, palmitic acid (C16:0) was found in the second lipoprotein fraction. Both lipoprotein isoforms were tested and found to have Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist activity in stimulating cytokine secretion from THP-1 cells. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis showed the secondary structure of rAg473 to be dominated by α-helices (48%), and the overall protein structure was stable up to 60 °C and could refold after having been exposed to a temperature cycle from 20 to 90 °C. In addition, the solubility of rAg473 (5 mg/mL) was not affected after several freeze-thaw cycles. These biophysical and immunological properties make rAg473 a good vaccine candidate against NmB. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79952135193	Increased expression of IL-21 reduces tumor growth by modulating the status of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes	The role of interleukin (IL)-21 in influencing tumor growth or enhancing anti-tumor immunity is somewhat controversial. To further understand the potential regulatory effects of IL-21, we utilized an IL-21-secreting EG7 tumor model to demonstrate the direct effects of IL-21 on host tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) profiles. Vector control EG7 cells (EG7-Vec) produced very low amounts of IL-21 and were highly tumorigenic. In contrast, IL-21-expressing EG7 cells, EG7-IL-21L and EG7-IL-21H, secreted relatively and extremely high levels of IL-21, respectively. Most importantly, both IL-21-expressing EG7 cells' control of tumor growth was not due to increased proliferative ability of tumor cells, but resulted from the induction of cytotoxic cellular responses in immunocompetent mice. To identify the effects of cancer immunoediting, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte profiles were analyzed. NK cell populations appeared to be increased in EG7-IL-21H tumor sites at days 6-8 (progression stage), though this phenomenon did not persist at days 10-12 (regression stage). However, at both days 6-8 and 10-12, a higher frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed at the tumor site in EG7-IL-21H-inoculated mice than in EG7-Vec-inoculated mice. These findings suggest that NK cell-mediated tumor rejection may efficiently drive the development of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell responses with the help of elevated IL-21 expression. These results also suggest the therapeutic potential of IL-21. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

79954578372	T-cell response to human papillomavirus type 52 L1, E6, and E7 peptides in women with transient infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive cancer	The E6 and E7 proteins encoded by human papillomaviruses (HPV) are prime targets for therapeutic vaccine development. Ninety-five women with HPV 52 infection (33 transient infections, 17 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II, 15 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III, and 30 invasive cervical cancers) were examined for T-cell responses using interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-γ ELISPOT) assay. Of the 29 peptides (13 L1, 10 E6, and 6 E7) screened positive by an in vitro peptide-binding assay, 14 were positive by the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Positive epitopes for HLA A11 were located at amino acid positions 103-111, 332-340, 342-350, and 373-381 of the L1 protein; and at 27-35 and 86-94 of the E6 protein; and at 1-9 and 27-35 of the E7 protein. A24-specific epitopes included 60-68 and 98-106 of the L1 protein, 42-50 and 59-67 of the E6 protein, and 24-32 of the E7 protein. Only one epitope (99-107) of the E6 protein showed positive responses for HLA A2 subjects. Overall, T-cell responses against L1 were observed mainly in subjects who had cleared infection; whereas responses against E6 and E7 were confined mainly to subjects who had developed cervical neoplasia. The proportion of subjects showing detectable T-cell responses was low across all grades of cervical neoplasia suggesting that immune evasion mechanisms had set on early in the course of disease progression. This study provides the first set of T-cell epitopes mapped for HPV 52, which can be considered for further evaluation as targets for immunotherapy. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79957796724	Recombinant trimeric HA protein immunogenicity of H5N1 avian influenza viruses and their combined use with inactivated or adenovirus vaccines	Background: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus continues to cause disease in poultry and humans. The hemagglutinin (HA) envelope protein is the primary target for subunit vaccine development. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used baculovirus-insect cell expression to obtain trimeric recombinant HA (rHA) proteins from two HPAI H5N1 viruses. We investigated trimeric rHA protein immunogenicity in mice via immunizations, and found that the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies resulted from coupling with a PELC/CpG adjuvant. We also found that the combined use of trimeric rHA proteins with (a) an inactivated H5N1 vaccine virus, or (b) a recombinant adenovirus encoding full-length HA sequences for prime-boost immunization, further improved antibody responses against homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus strains. Data from cross-clade prime-boost immunization regimens indicate that sequential immunization with different clade HA antigens increased antibody responses in terms of total IgG level and neutralizing antibody titers. Conclusion/Significance: Our findings suggest that the use of trimeric rHA in prime-boost vaccine regimens represents an alternative strategy for recombinant H5N1 vaccine development. © 2011 Lin et al.

79957836497	Identification and characterization of a cross-neutralization epitope of Enterovirus 71	Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections in children manifest as exanthema and are most commonly known as hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Because it can cause severe neurological complications like poliomyelitis, EV71 has now emerged as an important neurotropic virus in Asia. EV71 virus has been shown to consist of 3 (A, B and C) genotypes and many subgenotypes. Although EV71 vaccine development has recently yielded promising preclinical results, yet the correlation between the content of antigen(s) in vaccine candidates and the level of protective antibody responses is not established. The neutralization epitope(s) of EV71 antigens could be used as the surrogate biomarker of vaccine potency. Using peptide ELISA, antisera generated from animals immunized with formalin-inactivated EV71 virion vaccine formulated in alum, EV71-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (nMAb) and a panel of 153 overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire sequences of VP1, VP2 and VP3 of EV71, we screened for immunodominant linear neutralization epitope(s). Synthetic peptide VP2-28, corresponding to residues 136-150 of VP2, was found to bind to and inhibit the binding to EV71 of nMAb MAB979 that was found to have cross-neutralizing activity against different genotypes of EV71 virus. In addition, VP2-28 was found to be recognized only by neutralizing antisera generated from rabbits immunized with the formalin-inactivated whole EV71 virion vaccine but not by antisera from immunized mice and rats. During the epitope mapping, a murine EV71 genotype- and strain-specific linear neutralization epitope VP1-43 was identified within residues 211-220 of VP1. Furthermore, based on sequence alignment and structure prediction analysis using poliovirus as the template for molecular modeling, the VP1-43 and VP2-28 epitopes were shown to run in parallel within 0.1. nm and form a rim of the canyon at the junction site of VP1 and VP2 in the viral capsid. In mouse, rat and rabbit immunogenicity studies, a dose-dependent relationship between the number of VP2-28 epitope units measured by a quantitative assay in vaccine preparations and the magnitude of neutralizing titers was demonstrated. VP2-28 has amino acid sequences that are highly conserved among EV71 genotypes, is not affected by formalin-treatment and long-term storage. Thus, VP2-28 could be used as the surrogate biomarker in the potency testing of candidate EV71 vaccines. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79959705422	Rapid isolation and characterization of bacterial lipopeptides using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis	The structural analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of lipoproteins is difficult due to the hydrophobic properties of their fatty acid moieties. At the present time, the relative positions of fatty acid components on the N-acyl-S-diacylglycerylcysteine core structure has not been specifically identified in any natural or bacterial expressed recombinant lipoproteins. In this study, we describe a rapid solid-phase extraction using acetonitrile and isopropanol method that can be performed manually to isolate large amounts of relatively pure lipopeptides generated by the limited tryptic-digestion of recombinant lipoproteins. Using these lipopeptides and LC/MS mass spectra analysis, two groups of N-terminal lipidated (diacyl or triacyl) molecules that differ by one fatty acid unit were successfully identified. This LC/MS method also provided the separation of lipopeptides differing by 14Da for the on-line MS identification. Multiple-stage fragmentation analyses of the di- and triacyl lipopeptides using both the positive and negative ion modes enabled to identify the putative structure of the N-acyl-S-diacylglycerylcysteine containing an amide bond to palmitic acid at the N-terminal cysteine, a palmitic acid at sn1 position, and an unsaturated fatty acid of either hexadecenoic acid, cyclopropaneoctanoic acid, oleic acid and nonadecenoic acid at sn2 position of diacylglycerol residue through ester bonding. For diacyl lipoprotein, the saturated palmitoyl fatty acid group is absent at sn1 position of glycerol-derived lipid residue of lipopeptide. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

79960609635	Development of a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for monitoring the Enterovirus 71 vaccine manufacturing process	Enterovirus 71 (EV71), the etiologic agent causes outbreaks with significant mortality in young children in Asia and currently there is no vaccine available. In this study, we report a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Q-ELISA) to determine the concentration of the EV71 VP2 antigen. EV71 virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced in the baculovirus expression system and used as the EV71 antigen reference standard. Antisera from both EV71-immunized chickens and rabbits were very efficient and useful as capture antibodies to bind various forms of EV71 antigens, whereas a commercial VP2-specific virus neutralizing monoclonal antibody MAB979 was found to be suitable for quantifying the amount of VP2 antigen. This Q-ELISA was used successfully to determine VP2 content at each stage of EV71 vaccine manufacturing process, particularly during the upstream harvest, downstream purification and viral inactivation steps. The amount of VP2 antigen and the magnitude of neutralizing titers were found to be dose-dependent in mice immunized with vaccine candidates. These results indicate that Q-ELISA could provide off-line timely quantitative measurements of VP2 antigen throughout the production cycle to evaluate critical attributes and conditions that may affect virus yields in culture media, the quality of purification methods, the stability and potency of final vaccine formulations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79961077781	Presentation of lipopeptide by dendritic cells induces anti-tumor responses via an endocytosis-independent pathway in vivo	Cross-presentation by DCs is the major mechanism by which exogenous antigens activate CTLs. However, the mechanisms of entry and presentation of vaccine peptides by DCs remain unclear. In this study, we determined that the mechanisms of antigen presentation differed between nonlipidated and monopalmitoylated peptide antigens. We found that a nonlipidated long peptide could be taken up by DCs and that the peptide could be colocalized with early endosomes. The uptake of nonlipidated peptides by DCs was inhibited at low temperatures or by the depolymerization of actin filaments or microtubules. In contrast, lipidated peptides were internalized by DCs at low temperatures, and internalization was not inhibited when actin filaments or microtubules were depolymerized. Moreover, lapidated peptide, but not nonlipidated peptide, was internalized by nonphagocytic Jurkat cells. The endosomal/lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways were necessary for nonlipidated presentation leading to the activation of CD8

79961081811	A novel single-dose dengue subunit vaccine induces memory immune responses	To protect against dengue viral infection, a novel lipidated dengue subunit vaccine was rationally designed to contain the consensus amino acid sequences derived from four serotypes of dengue viruses. We found that the lipidated consensus dengue virus envelope protein domain III (LcED III) is capable of activating antigen-presenting cells and enhancing cellular and humoral immune responses. A single-dose of LcED III immunization in mice without extra adjuvant formulation is sufficient to elicit neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of dengue viruses. In addition, strong memory responses were elicited in mice immunized with a single-dose of LcED III. Quick, anamnestic neutralizing antibody responses to a live dengue virus challenge were elicited at week 28 post-immunization. These results demonstrate the promising possibility of a future successful tetravalent vaccine against dengue viral infections that utilizes one-dose vaccination with LcED III. © 2011 Chiang et al.

80052485617	Fabrication of influenza virus-like particles using M2 fusion proteins for imaging single viruses and designing vaccines	Influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) are noninfectious and the assembly of influenza VLPs depends on the interactions of M1 proteins and/or other viral surface proteins, such as HA, NA, and M2, with the cellular lipid membranes. In this study we propose that M2 protein can be used as a molecular fabricator without disrupting the assembly of VLPs and while retaining the native structures of HA and NA envelope protein oligomers on the particle surfaces. First, we demonstrated that influenza VLPs can be fabricated by the M2 fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein for imaging single virus entering A549 cells. Second, we engineered two molecular adjuvants (flagellin and profilin) fused to M2 protein to generate molecular adjuvanted VLPs. Theses molecular adjuvanted VLPs had stimulatory functions, including increasing TNF-α production and promoting the maturation of dendritic cells. Immunization of mice with molecular adjuvanted VLPs also enhanced the response of the neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses. The results can provide useful information for imaging single viruses and designing novel vaccines against influenza virus infection. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, its manufacturing capacity would be vulnerable during pandemics caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Therefore, vaccine production using mammalian cell technology is becoming attractive. Current influenza H5N1 vaccine strain (NIBRG-14), a reassortant virus between A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus and egg-adapted high-growth A/PR/8/1934 virus, could grow efficiently in eggs and MDCK cells but not Vero cells which is the most popular cell line for manufacturing human vaccines.

84855854549	Human SCARB2-mediated entry and endocytosis of EV71	Enterovirus (EV) 71 infection is known to cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and in severe cases, induces neurological disorders culminating in fatality. An outbreak of EV71 in South East Asia in 1997 affected over 120,000 people and caused neurological disorders in a few individuals. The control of EV71 infection through public health interventions remains minimal and treatments are only symptomatic. Recently, human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) has been reported to be a cellular receptor of EV71. We expressed human SCARB2 gene in NIH3T3 cells (3T3-SCARB2) to study the mechanisms of EV71 entry and infection. We demonstrated that human SCARB2 serves as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry. Disruption of expression of SCARB2 using siRNAs can interfere EV71 infection and subsequent inhibit the expression of viral capsid proteins in RD and 3T3-SCARB2 but not Vero cells. SiRNAs specific to clathrin or dynamin or chemical inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis were all capable of interfering with the entry of EV71 into 3T3-SCARB2 cells. On the other hand, caveolin specific siRNA or inhibitors of caveolae-mediated endocytosis had no effect, confirming that only clathrin-mediated pathway was involved in EV71 infection. Endocytosis of EV71 was also found to be pH-dependent requiring endosomal acidification and also required intact membrane cholesterol. In summary, the mechanism of EV71 entry through SCARB2 as the receptor for attachment, and its cellular entry is through a clathrin-mediated and pH-dependent endocytic pathway. This study on the receptor and endocytic mechanisms of EV71 infection is useful for the development of effective medications and prophylactic treatment against the enterovirus. © 2012 Lin et al.

84859809904	Pilot scale production of highly efficacious and stable enterovirus 71 vaccine candidates	Background: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has caused several epidemics of hand, foot and mouth diseases (HFMD) in Asia and now is being recognized as an important neurotropic virus. Effective medications and prophylactic vaccine against EV71 infection are urgently needed. Based on the success of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, a prototype chemically inactivated EV71 vaccine candidate has been developed and currently in human phase 1 clinical trial. Principal Finding: In this report, we present the development of a serum-free cell-based EV71 vaccine. The optimization at each step of the manufacturing process was investigated, characterized and quantified. In the up-stream process development, different commercially available cell culture media either containing serum or serum-free was screened for cell growth and virus yield using the roller-bottle technology. VP-SFM serum-free medium was selected based on the Vero cell growth profile and EV71 virus production. After the up-stream processes (virus harvest, diafiltration and concentration), a combination of gel-filtration liquid chromatography and/or sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation down-stream purification processes were investigated at a pilot scale of 40 liters each. Although the combination of chromatography and sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation produced extremely pure EV71 infectious virus particles, the overall yield of vaccine was 7-10% as determined by a VP2-based quantitative ELISA. Using chromatography as the downstream purification, the virus yield was 30-43%. To retain the integrity of virus neutralization epitopes and the stability of the vaccine product, the best virus inactivation was found to be 0.025% formalin-treatment at 37°C for 3 to 6 days. Furthermore, the formalin-inactivated virion vaccine candidate was found to be stable for >18 months at 4°C and a microgram of viral proteins formulated with alum adjuvant could induce strong virus-neutralizing antibody responses in mice, rats, rabbits, and non-human primates. Conclusion: These results provide valuable information supporting the current cell-based serum-free EV71 vaccine candidate going into human Phase I clinical trials. © 2012 Chou et al.

84862220814	Broader neutralizing antibodies against H5N1 viruses using prime-boost immunization of hyperglycosylated hemagglutinin DNA and virus-like particles	Background: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses and their transmission capability from birds to humans have raised global concerns about a potential human pandemic. The inherent nature of antigenic changes in influenza viruses has not been sufficiently taken into account in immunogen designs for broadly protective HPAI H5N1 vaccines. Methods: We designed a hyperglycosylated HA vaccine using N-linked glycan masking on highly variable sequences in the HA1 globular head. Immunization of these hyperglycosylated HA DNA vaccines followed by a flagellin-containing virus-like particle booster in mice was conducted to evaluate neutralizing antibody responses against various clades of HPAI H5N1 viruses. Results: We introduced nine N-X-S/T motifs in five HA1 regions: 83NNT, 86NNT, 94NFT, 127NSS, 138NRT, 156NTT, 161NRS, 182NDT, and 252NAT according to sequence alignment analyses from 163 HPAI H5N1 human isolates. Although no significant differences of anti-HA total IgG titers were found with these hyperglycosyalted HA compared to the wild-type control, the 83NNT and 127NSS mutants elicited significantly potent cross-clade neutralizing antibodies against HPAI H5N1 viruses. Conclusions: This finding may have value in terms of novel immunogen design for developing cross-protective H5N1 vaccines. © 2012 Lin et al.

84863377785	A novel HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope of tumor-associated antigen L6 can inhibit tumor growth in vivo	Vaccines utilizing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes are promising for the treatment of cancer and chronic infectious diseases. Tumor-associated antigen L6 (TAL6) is overexpressed in some epithelial cancer cells. In this report, we detected TAL6 expression in breast cancer tissue using quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We found that >80% of breast tumor tissue highly expressed TAL6 compared with adjacent normal breast tissue. To identify CTL epitopes from TAL6, we synthesized 18 peptides for HLA-A2-binding assay based on the MHC-binding motif using 4 computer prediction programs. Positive binders identified by ELISA were immunized in HLA-A2 transgenic (A2 Tg) mice. Two peptides, peptide 2 and peptide 5, induced T-cell responses in A2 Tg mice. To confirm whether these peptides could be processed and presented to induce T-cell responses in vivo, A2 Tg mice were immunized with plasmid DNA encoding TAL6. We found that both peptides 2 and 5 stimulated splenocytes from TAL6-immunized mice to secrete interferon-γ. However, only peptide 5 could induce expression of the cytolytic molecule CD107a on CD8

84863998596	Recombinant lipidated HPV E7 induces a Th-1-biased immune response and protective immunity against cervical cancer in a mouse model	The E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus (HPV) is an ideal target for developing immunotherapeutic strategies against HPV-associated tumors. However, because protein-based immunogens alone are poor elicitors of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses, they have been difficult to exploit for therapeutic purposes. In this study, we report that a recombinant lipoprotein consisting of inactive E7 (E7m) biologically linked to a bacterial lipid moiety (rlipo-E7m) induces the maturation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), skews the immune responses toward the Th1 responses and induces E7-specific CTL responses. We further studied the ability of rlipo-E7m to provide protection against a TC-1 tumor cell challenge in an animal model. Mice prophylactically immunized with two 10-μg doses of rlipo-E7m were found to be free of TC-1 tumor growth. Experiments in a therapeutic immunization model showed that the tumor volume in mice receiving a single dose of rlipo-E7m was less than 0.01 cm

Adjuvants can help to overcome some of these inherent defects with subunit vaccines. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the newly developed water-in-oil-in-water multiphase emulsion system, termed PELC, in potentiating the protective capacity of dengue-1 envelope protein domain III. Unlike aluminum phosphate, dengue-1 envelope protein domain III formulated with PELC plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides induced neutralizing antibodies against dengue-1 virus and increased the splenocyte secretion of IFN-γ after in vitro re-stimulation. The induced antibodies contained both the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses. A rapid anamnestic neutralizing antibody response against a live dengue virus challenge was elicited at week 26 after the first immunization. These results demonstrate that PELC plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides broaden the dengue-1 envelope protein domain III-specific immune responses.

84865961485	Challenges to Licensure of Enterovirus 71 Vaccines	Human enteroviruses usually cause self-limited infections except polioviruses and enterovirus 71 (EV71), which frequently involve neurological complications. EV71 vaccines are being evaluated in humans. However, several challenges to licensure of EV71 vaccines need to be addressed. Firstly, EV71 and coxsackievirus A (CA) are frequently found to co-circulate and cause hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). A polyvalent vaccine that can provide protection against EV71 and prevalent CA are desirable. Secondly, infants are the target population of HFMD vaccines and it would need multi-national efficacy trials to prove clinical protection and speed up the licensure and usage of HFMD vaccines in children. An international network for enterovirus surveillance and clinical trials is urgently needed. Thirdly, EV71 is found to evolve quickly in the past 15 years. Prospective cohort studies are warranted to clarify clinical and epidemiological significances of the antigenic and genetic variations between different EV71 genogroups, which is critical for vaccine design. © 2012 Lee et al.

84872249666	Production of EV71 vaccine candidates	Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is now recognized as an emerging neurotropic virus in Asia and with Coxsackie virus (CV) it is the other major causative agent of hand-foot-mouth diseases (HFMD). Effective medications and/or prophylactic vaccines against HFMD are urgently needed. From a scientific (the feasibility of bioprocess, immunological responses and potency in animal challenge model) and business development (cost of goods) points of view, we in this review address and discuss the pros and cons of different EV71 vaccine candidates that have been produced and evaluated in animal models. Epitope-based synthetic peptide vaccine candidates containing residues 211-225 of VP1 formulated with Freund's adjuvant (CFA/IFA) elicited low EV71 virus neutralizing antibody responses, but were protective in the suckling mouse challenge model. Among recombinant EV71 subunits (rVP1, rVP2 and rVP3) expressed in E. coli, purified and formulated with CFA/IFA, only VP1 elicited mouse antibody responses with measurable EV71-specific virus neutralization titers. Immunization of mice with either a DNA plasmid containing VP1 gene or VP1 expressed in Salmonella typhimurium also generated neutralizing antibody responses and protected animals against a live EV71 challenge. Recombinant EV71 virus-like particles (rVLP) produced from baculovirus formulated either with CFA/IFA or alum elicited good virus neutralization titers in both mice and non-human primates, and were found to be protective in the suckling mouse EV71 challenge model. Synthetic peptides or recombinant EV71 subunit vaccines (rVP1 and rVLP) formulated in alum were found to be poorly immunogenic in rabbits. Only formalin-inactivated (FI) EV71 virions formulated in alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies against different EV71 genotypes in mice, rabbits and non-human primates but induced weak neutralizing responses against CAV16. From a regulatory, economic and market acceptability standpoint, FI-EV71 virion vaccines are the most promising candidates and are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials. We further describe and analyze some new bioprocesses technologies that have great potential applications in EV71 vaccine development. This review also demonstrates the opportunities and challenges that the Asian vaccine industry faces today. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84874378993	Human SCARB2 Transgenic Mice as an Infectious Animal Model for Enterovirus 71	Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus (CVA) are the most common causative factors for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and neurological disorders in children. Lack of a reliable animal model is an issue in investigating EV71-induced disease manifestation in humans, and the current clinical therapies are symptomatic. We generated a novel EV71-infectious model with hSCARB2-transgenic mice expressing the discovered receptor human SCARB2 (hSCARB2). The challenge of hSCARB2-transgenic mice with clinical isolates of EV71 and CVA16 resulted in HFMD-like and neurological syndromes caused by E59 (B4) and N2838 (B5) strains, and lethal paralysis caused by 5746 (C2), N3340 (C4), and CVA16. EV71 viral loads were evident in the tissues and CNS accompanied the upregulated pro-inflammatory mediators (CXCL10, CCL3, TNF-α, and IL-6), correlating to recruitment of the infiltrated T lymphocytes that result in severe diseases. Transgenic mice pre-immunized with live E59 or the FI-E59 vaccine was able to resist the subsequent lethal challenge with EV71. These results indicate that hSCARB2-transgenic mice are a useful model for assessing anti-EV71 medications and for studying the pathogenesis induced by EV71. © 2013 Lin et al.

84879079732	Enzymatic stability and immunoregulatory efficacy of a synthetic indolicidin analogue with regular enantiomeric sequence	Cell-mediated immunity plays a major role in protecting the host from viral infections and tumor challenge. Here, we report the enzymatic stability and adjuvanticity of a peptiomimetic stereoisomer of the bovine neutrophil peptide indolicidin. The analogue, dubbed LD-indolicidin, contains the regular enantiomeric sequence of indolicidin and is synthesized by general stepwise solid-phase strategy. LD-Indolicidin possesses high resistance to enzymatic degradation and shows tolerance in mice. As vaccine adjuvant, LD-indolicidin is better able than the native form of indolicidin to enhance cell-mediated immune responses, using inactivated H5N1 virus as a model antigen. Taken together, these results open up a new approach to the development of vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapy technologies. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84879695861	A consensus envelope protein domain III can induce neutralizing antibody responses against serotype 2 of dengue virus in non-human primates	We have previously demonstrated that vaccination with a subunit dengue vaccine containing a consensus envelope domain III with aluminum phosphate elicits neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of dengue virus in mice. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of the subunit dengue vaccine in non-human primates. After vaccination, monkeys that received the subunit vaccine with aluminum phosphate developed a significantly strong and long-lasting antibody response. A specific T cell response with cytokine production was also induced, and this correlated with the antibody response. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against serotype 2 were detected in two of three monkeys. The increase in serotype-2-specific antibody titers and avidity observed in these two monkeys suggested that a serotype-2-biased antibody response occurs. These data provide evidence that a protective neutralizing antibody response was successfully elicited in non-human primates by the dengue subunit vaccine with aluminum phosphate adjuvant. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

84880802401	Protective Efficacy of VP1-Specific Neutralizing Antibody Associated with a Reduction of Viral Load and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in Human SCARB2-Transgenic Mice	Hand-foot-mouth diseases (HFMD) caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CVA16) in children have now become a severe public health issue in the Asian-Pacific region. Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (hSCARB2, a receptor of EV71 and CVA16) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections. In this study, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 neutralizing antibody, N3. A single injection of N3 effectively inhibited the HFMD-like skin scurfs in mice pre-infected with clinical isolate of EV71 E59 (B4 genotype) or prevented severe limb paralysis and death in mice pre-inoculated with 5746 (C2 genotype). This protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain, spinal cord and limb muscles. Accumulated viral loads and the associated pro-inflammatory cytokines were all reduced. The protective efficacy of N3 was not observed in animals challenged with CVA16. This could be due to dissimilarity sequences of the neutralizing epitope found in CVA16. These results indicate N3 could be useful in treating severe EV71 infections and the hSCARB2-transgenic mouse could be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti-enterovirus agent candidates. © 2013 Chang et al.

Here, we report a novel approach that combined an immunomodulator and delivery system to enhance antigen association and induce robust immunity. We expressed a recombinant lipidated dengue-1 envelope protein domain III (LD1ED III) and its non-lipidated form, D1ED III, in an Escherichia coli system. The LD1ED III contains a bacterial lipid moiety, which is a potent immunomodulator. We demonstrated that LD1ED III possesses an inherent immunostimulation ability that can activate RAW 264.7 macrophage cells by up-regulating their expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86 and MHC II, whereas D1ED III could not induce the up-regulation of these molecules. Moreover, combining LD1ED III with a multiphase emulsion system (called PELC) increased the antigen association more than either combining D1ED III with PELC or the antigen alone. Enhanced antigen association has been shown to correlate with stronger T cell responses, greater antibody avidity and improved neutralizing capacity. Our results demonstrate that combining recombinant lipoproteins with PELC improved both the intensity and the quality of the immune response. This approach is a promising strategy for the development of subunit vaccines that induce robust immunity. © 2013 Institut Pasteur.

84884697281	Lipidated Dengue-2 Envelope Protein Domain III Independently Stimulates Long-Lasting Neutralizing Antibodies and Reduces the Risk of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement	Background:Dengue virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause self-limiting dengue fever, severe life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The existence of four serotypes of dengue virus has complicated the development of an effective and safe dengue vaccine. Recently, a clinical phase 2b trial of Sanofi Pasteur's CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine revealed that the vaccine did not confer full protection against dengue-2 virus. New approaches to dengue vaccine development are urgently needed. Our approach represents a promising method of dengue vaccine development and may even complement the deficiencies of the CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine.Methodology/Principal Findings:Two important components of a vaccine, the immunogen and immunopotentiator, were combined into a single construct to generate a new generation of vaccines. We selected dengue-2 envelope protein domain III (D2ED III) as the immunogen and expressed this protein in lipidated form in Escherichia coli, yielding an immunogen with intrinsic immunopotentiation activity. The formulation containing lipidated D2ED III (LD2ED III) in the absence of exogenous adjuvant elicited higher D2ED III-specific antibody responses than those obtained from its nonlipidated counterpart, D2ED III, and dengue-2 virus. In addition, the avidity and neutralizing capacity of the antibodies induced by LD2ED III were higher than those elicited by D2ED III and dengue-2 virus. Importantly, we showed that after lipidation, the subunit candidate LD2ED III exhibited increased immunogenicity while reducing the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in mice.Conclusions/Significance:Our study suggests that the lipidated subunit vaccine approach could be applied to other serotypes of dengue virus and other pathogens. © 2013 Chiang et al.

84890157277	Disintegration and cancer immunotherapy efficacy of a squalane-in-water delivery system emulsified by bioresorbable poly(ethylene glycol)-block-polylactide	Vaccine adjuvant is conferred on the substance that helps to enhance antigen-specific immune response. Here we investigated the disintegration characteristics and immunotherapy potency of an emulsified delivery system comprising bioresorbable polymer poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactide (PEG-PLA), phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and metabolizable oil squalane. PEG-PLA-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions show good stability at 4°C and at room temperature. At 37°C, squalane/PEG-PLA/PBS emulsion with oil/aqueous weight ratio of 7/3 (denominated PELA73) was stable for 6 weeks without phase separation. As PEG-PLA being degraded, 30% of free oil at the surface layer and 10% of water at the bottom disassociated from the PELA73 emulsion were found after 3 months. A MALDI-TOF MS study directly on the DIOS plate enables us to identify low molecular weight components released during degradation. Our results confirm the loss of PLA moiety of the emulsifier PEG-PLA directly affected the stability of PEG-PLA-stabilized emulsion, leading to emulsion disintegration and squalane/water phase separation. As adjuvant for cancer immunotherapeutic use, an HPV16 E7 peptide antigen formulated with PELA73 plus immunostimulatory CpG molecules could strongly enhance antigen-specific T-cell responses as well as anti-tumor ability with respected to non-formulated or Alum-formulated peptide. Accordingly, these advances may be a potential immunoregulatory strategy in manipulating the immune responses induced by tumor-associated antigens. © 2013 The Authors.

84894455324	Recombinant lipidated dengue-4 envelope protein domain III elicits protective immunity	The combination of recombinant protein antigens with an immunostimulator has the potential to greatly increase the immunogenicity of recombinant protein antigens. In the present study, we selected the dengue-4 envelope protein domain III as a dengue vaccine candidate and expressed the protein in lipidated form using an Escherichia coli-based system. The recombinant lipidated dengue-4 envelope protein domain III folded into the proper conformation and competed with the dengue-4 virus for cellular binding sites. Mice immunized with lipidated dengue-4 envelope protein domain III without exogenous adjuvant had higher frequencies of dengue-4 envelope protein domain III-specific B cells secreting antibodies than mice immunized with the nonlipidated form. Importantly, lipidated dengue-4 envelope protein domain III-immunized mice demonstrated a durable neutralizing antibody response and had reduced viremia levels after challenge. The study demonstrates that lipidated dengue-4 envelope protein domain III is immunogenic and may be a potential dengue vaccine candidate. Furthermore, the lipidation strategy can be applied to other serotypes of dengue virus. © 2014 The Authors.

84899567400	Molecular mechanisms of TLR2-Mediated antigen cross-presentation in dendritic cells	Cross-presentation is a key function of dendritic cells (DCs), which present exogenous Ags on MHC class I molecules to prime CTL responses. The effects of TLR triggering on the cross-presentation of exogenous Ags by DCs remain unclear. In this study, we used synthetic dipalmitoylated peptides and TLR2 agonist-conjugated peptides as models to elucidate the mechanisms of TLR2- mediated cross-presentation. We observed that the internalization of dipalmitoylated peptides by bone marrow-derived DCs was facilitated by TLR2 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The administration of these dipalmitoylated peptide-pulsed bone marrow-derived DCs eliminated established tumors through TLR2 signaling. We further demonstrated that the induction of Ag-specific CTL responses and tumor regression by dipalmitoylated peptides was TAP independent. In addition, presentation of dipalmitoylated peptides by MHC class I molecules was blocked in the presence of an endosomal acidification inhibitor (chloroquine) or a lysosomal degradation inhibitor (Z-FL-COCHO). The endocytosed dipalmitoylated peptide also passed rapidly from early endosome Ag-1-positive endosomes to RAS-related GTP-binding protein 7 (Rab7)-associated late endosomes compared with their nonlipidated counterparts. Furthermore, we found that dipalmitoylated peptide-upregulated Rab7 expression correlated with Ag presentation via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway. Both JNK and ERK signaling pathways are required for upregulation of Rab7. In summary, our data suggest that TLR2-mediated cross-presentation occurs through the upregulation of Rab7 and a TAP-independent pathway that prime CTL responses.

84903641453	Immunogenicity studies of bivalent inactivated virions of EV71/CVA16 formulated with submicron emulsion systems	We assessed two strategies for preparing candidate vaccines against hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) caused mainly by infections of enterovirus (EV) 71 and coxsackievirus (CV) A16. We firstly design and optimize the potency of adjuvant combinations of emulsion-based delivery systems, using EV71 candidate vaccine as a model. We then perform immunogenicity studies in mice of EV71/CVA16 antigen combinations formulated with PELC/CpG. A single dose of inactivated EV71 virion (0.2 g) emulsified in submicron particles was found (i) to induce potent antigen-specific neutralizing antibody responses and (ii) consistently to elicit broad antibody responses against EV71 neutralization epitopes. A single dose immunogenicity study of bivalent activated EV71/CVA16 virion formulated with either Alum or PELC/CpG adjuvant showed that CVA16 antigen failed to elicit CVA16 neutralizing antibody responses and did not affect EV71-specific neutralizing antibody responses. A boosting dose of emulsified EV71/CVA16 bivalent vaccine candidate was found to be necessary to achieve high seroconversion of CVA16-specific neutralizing antibody responses. The current results are important for the design and development of prophylactic vaccines against HFMD and other emerging infectious diseases. © 2014 Chih-Wei Lin et al.

84906268551	A poorly neutralizing IgG2a/c response elicited by a DNA vaccine protects mice against Japanese encephalitis virus	We demonstrated previously that immunization with a DNA vaccine expressing the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) envelope (E) protein conferred a high level of protection through a poorly neutralizing antibody response. Here, we further investigated the role of the IgG subclass in this antibody-dependent protection using cytokine co-immunization and cytokine-deficient mice. A significant difference in IgG2a/c but not IgG1 was observed between mice that survived or died following a lethal challenge. Correspondingly, the IgG2a/c response and protection increased in IL-4-deficient mice but decreased in IFN-γ-deficient mice, highlighting the importance of IgG2a/c. In addition, the restoration of protection and E-specific IgG2a/c production in IFN-γ-deficient mice by a T helper (Th) type 1-biased intramuscular immunization suggested that IgG2a/c but not IFN-γ was the major component for protection. The failure of protection against a direct intracranial challenge indicated that IgG2a/c-mediated protection was restricted to outside the central nervous system. Consistent with this conclusion, passive transfer of E-specific antisera conferred protection only pre-exposure to JEV. Therefore, our data provided evidence that the IgG subclass plays an important role in protection against JEV, particular in poorly neutralizing E-specific antibodies, and Th1-biased IgG2a/c confers better protection than Th2-biased IgG1 against JEV. © 2014 The Authors.

84908688873	Long-Term immunogenicity studies of formalin-inactivated enterovirus 71 whole-Virion vaccine in macaques	Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has caused epidemics of hand, foot and mouth diseases in Asia during the past decades and no vaccine is available. A formalin-inactivated EV71 candidate vaccine (EV71vac) based on B4 subgenotype has previously been developed and found to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses in mice and humans. In this study, we evaluated the long-term immunogenicity and safety of this EV71vac in a non-human primate model. Juvenile macaques were immunized at 0, 3 and 6 weeks either with 10 or 5 mg doses of EV71vac formulated with AlPO4 adjuvant, or PBS as control. During the 56 weeks of studies, no fever nor local redness and swelling at sites of injections was observed in the immunized macaques. After single immunization, 100% seroconversion based on 4-fold increased in neutralization titer (Nt) was detected in EV71vac immunized monkeys but not PBS controls. A dose-dependent IgG antibody response was observed in monkeys receiving EV71vac immunization. The Nt of EV71vac immunized macaques had reached the peak after 3 vaccinations, then decreased gradually; however, the GMT of neutralizing antibody in the EV71vac immunized macaques were still above 100 at the end of the study. Correspondingly, both dose- and time-dependent interferon-c and CD4+ T cell responses were detected in monkeys receiving EV71vac. Interestingly, similar to human responses, the dominant T cell epitopes of macaques were identified mainly in VP2 and VP3 regions. In addition, strong cross-neutralizing antibodies against most EV71 subgenotypes except some C2 and C4b strains, and Coxsackievirus A16 were observed. In summary, our results indicate that EV71vac elicits dose-dependent T-cell and antibody responses in macaques that could be a good animal model for evaluating the long-term immune responses elicited by EV71 vaccines.
