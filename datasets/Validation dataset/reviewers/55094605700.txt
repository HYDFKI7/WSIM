33646785767	The anti-tumor effects of alkaloids from the seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica on HepG2 cells and its possible mechanism	To screen the anti-tumor effects of the four alkaloids: brucine, strychnine, brucine N-oxide and isostrychnine from the seed of Strychnos nux-vomica, MTT assay was used to examine the growth inhibitory effects of these alkaloids on human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Brucine, strychnine and isostrychnine revealed significant inhibitory effects against HepG2 cell proliferation, whereas brucine N-oxide didn't have such an effect. In addition, brucine caused HepG2 cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, apoptotic body formation, all of which are typical characteristics of apoptotic programmed cell death. The results of flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that brucine caused dose-dependent apoptosis of HepG2 cells through cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, thus preventing cells entering S or G2/M phase. Immunoblot results revealed that brucine significantly decreased the protein expression level of cyclooxygenase-2, whereas increased the expression caspase-3 as well as the caspase-3-like protease activity in HepG2 cells, suggesting the involvement of cyclooxygenase-2 and caspase-3 in the pro-apoptotic effects exerted by brucine. Therefore, this paper indicate that the major alkaloids present in the seed of Strychnos nux-vomica are effective against HepG2 cells proliferation, among which brucine proceed HepG2 cells death via apoptosis, probably through the participation of caspase-3 and cyclooxygenase-2. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

80052644840	SOCS3: A potential therapeutic target for many human diseases	SOCS3 has significant regulation effects in cell signal transduction pathways, which can be induced by many kinds of cytokines and proinflammatory factors. After being studied for years, the effect of SOCS3 has become clear in maintaining physiological functions and affecting histopathologic changes in human tissues. This review presents the role of SOCS3 in the occurrence, development, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases, such as inflammation, virus infection, obesity and tumor. As abnormal levels or impaired function of SOCS3 were reported in the onset and development of disease, SOCS3 can be considered as a bio-marker to diagnose and predict prognosis of some disorders, and as a therapeutic target for certain diseases.

84887506583	Blockade of Cav2.1-mediated NMDA receptor signaling disrupts conditioned fear extinction	Although fear extinction requires N-methyl= d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling, Cav2.1-regulated synaptic function in extinction remains unknown. This study examined whether Cav2.1-mediated signaling plays role in consolidation of extinction. Wild-type mice received intracerebroventricular injection of Cav2.1 blocker (ω-agatoxin IVA, 4.0. pg/side) showed impaired extinction behavior and increased expression of CREB-dependent gene Arc in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Intra-mPFC injections of NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801, 0.5. μg/midline), which was ineffective in wild-type controls, blocked extinction in heterozygous rolling Nagoya (rol/+) mice carrying Cav2.1α1 gene mutation rol/+ mice. These results indicate that Cav2.1-mediated NMDA receptor signaling is functional pathway in mPFC-dependent fear extinction. Our results also indicate that the combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches can be used to study functional signaling pathways in neuronal circuits. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84888005518	MiR-133a represses tumour growth and metastasis in colorectal cancer by targeting LIM and SH3 protein 1 and inhibiting the MAPK pathway	In recent studies of microRNA expression, miR-133a deregulation was identified in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of CRC are poorly understood. We found that miR-133a expression was usually down-regulated in CRC cell lines and tissue specimens. Ectopic miR-133a expression inhibited cell proliferation and cell migration. Stable overexpression of miR-133a was sufficient to suppress tumour growth and intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Additional studies showed that miR-133a can target the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) mRNA and suppress the expression of LASP1, which we identified in previous studies as a CRC-associated protein. In contrast to the phenotypes induced by miR-133a restoration, LASP1-induced cell proliferation and migration rescued miR-133a-mediated biological behaviours, as did LASP1 overexpression. Investigations of possible mechanisms underlying these behaviours revealed that miR-133a modulates the expression of key cellular molecules and participates in the MAPK pathway by inhibiting phosphorylation of ERK and MEK. miR-133a may play a key role in CRC genesis and metastasis, which suggests its potential role in the molecular therapy of cancer. © 2013 The Authors.

84897048475	ABCB6, ABCB1 and ABCG1 genetic polymorphisms and antidepressant response of SSRIs in Chinese depressive patients	Aim: Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric disorder with worldwide prevalence. The most widely prescribed antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). ATP-binding cassette proteins are responsible for the membrane transport of various molecules including antidepressive drugs. We investigated whether SNPs in ABCB6, ABCB1 and ABCG1 were associated with the treatment response of SSRIs. Materials & methods: A pharmacogenetic study genotyping nine SNPs was conducted in 290 major depressive disorder patients in the Chinese Han population. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between responders and nonresponders. Results: The allele frequencies of rs28401781 and rs4148739 in ABCB1 showed significant difference between responders and nonresponders before correction (p = 0.0297 and p = 0.0359, respectively). No significant associations were detected for the ABCB6 or ABCG1 gene. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ABCB1 polymorphisms might be associated with SSRIs treatment response in the Chinese Han population.

67650085802	Heat acclimation induced acquired heat tolerance and cross adaptation in different grape cultivars: Relationships to photosynthetic energy partitioning	Several mechanisms on acquired heat tolerance and cross adaptation have been proposed; however, relationships to photosynthetic energy partitioning remain unknown. The effects of heat pretreatment on cold and heat tolerance in grapevine leaves of two cultivars ('Jingxiu', cold sensitive; 'Beta', cold tolerant) were evident in changes in the antioxidant system, lipid peroxidation, net photosynthesis rate and also in chlorophyll fluorescence according:Y(II)+Y(NPQ)+Y(NO)≤1, where Y(II) is the effective PSII quantum yield; Y(NPQ) is regulated energy dissipation as a protective mechanism; and Y(NO) is non-regulated energy dissipation as a damaging mechanism. Heat pretreatment enhanced heat tolerance in the two cultivars, which was associated with less energy partitioned in non-regulated energy dissipation, less lipid peroxidation and higher antioxidant enzyme (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and guaiacol peroxidase) activities compared with control plants under heat stress. Heat pretreatment also induced cold tolerance in 'Jingxiu' and 'Beta' leaves. This cross adaptation seemed to be attributable in part to less non-regulated energy dissipation in pretreated 'Jingxiu' and 'Beta' than the controls under cold stress. The evidence that lipid peroxidation was less and antioxidant enzyme activities were higher in pretreated plants under cold stress further corroborated the results from energy partitioning. © 2009 CSIRO.

70149088257	Photosynthetic responses to chromosome doubling in relation to leaf anatomy in Lonicera japonica subjected to water stress	Gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and contents of some metabolites in two Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.) cultivars, Damaohua (2n=2x) and Jiufengyihao (2n=4x), were compared with explore the function of chromosome doubling under water stress conditions. Water stress significantly decreased net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate of both cultivars. It also decreased electron transport rate, effective quantum yield of Photosystem II, photochemical quenching, and starch content, but increased non-photochemical quenching and contents of total soluble sugars, proline, and alondialdehyde. However, the tetraploid cultivar showed higher resistance to water stress than the diploid, as indicated by the fact that gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and metabolites were less affected for the tetraploid than the diploid. Moreover, the tetraploid recovered more quickly than the diploid after re-watering. Morphological and anatomical analysis further revealed that the tetraploid possessed less whole plant leaf area, higher leaf mass per unit area, thicker epidermis (both upper and lower) and palisade tissue, as well as denser pubescence. All of those specialised structures caused by chromosome doubling might lead to greater capacity in coping with drought stress. Our findings suggest that the effect of chromosome doubling on drought resistance in L. japonica could attribute to the improvement of structure and photosynthesis-related traits. © CSIRO 2009.

77649316006	Photosynthesis of young apple trees in response to low sink demand under different air temperatures	Gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic end products and related enzymes in source leaves in response to low sink demand after girdling to remove the root sink were assessed in young apple trees (Malus pumila) grown in two greenhouses with different air temperatures for 5 days. Compared with the non-girdled control in the low-temperature greenhouse (diurnal maximum air temperature <32 °C), low sink demand resulted in lower net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) but higher leaf temperature on Day 5, while in the high-temperature greenhouse (diurnal maximum air temperature >36 °C), Pn, gs and E declined from Day 3 onwards. Moreover, gas exchange responded more to low sink demand in the high-temperature greenhouse than in the low-temperature greenhouse. Decreased Pn at low sink demand was accompanied by lower intercellular CO2 concentrations in the low-temperature greenhouse. However, decreased maximal photochemical efficiency, potential activity, efficiency of excitation capture, actual efficiency and photochemical quenching, with increased minimal fluorescence and non-photochemical quenching of photosystem II (PSII), were observed in low sink demand leaves only in the high-temperature greenhouse. In addition, low sink demand increased leaf starch and soluble carbohydrate content in both greenhouses but did not result in lower activity of enzymes involved in metabolism. Thus, decreased Pn under low sink demand was independent of a direct effect of end-product feedback but rather depended on a high temperature threshold. The lower Pn was likely due to stomatal limitation in the low-temperature greenhouse, but mainly due to non-stomatal limitation in the high-temperature greenhouse.

78649313267	Hippocampal activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, protein kinase B, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in a chronic stress rat model of depression	Recent studies have shown that varied stress stimuli activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protein kinase B (Akt), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) signal transduction pathway, and also regulate various apoptotic cascades. JNK and p38 promote apoptosis, but Akt protects against apoptosis, in hippocampal neurons. However, changes in the transduction pathway in different regions of brain tissues in a chronic stress rat model of depression remain poorly understood. Results from this study showed that JNK phosphorylation levels were significantly greater in the stress group hippocampus compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference in JNK phosphorylation levels was detected in the rat cerebral cortex between stress and control groups, and no significant difference in Akt and p38 phosphorylation levels was detected in the rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex between stress and control groups (P > 0.05). These results suggested that the JNK signal pathway is activated by JNK phosphorylation and participates in pathophysiological changes in rat models of depression.

78349265012	Cloning and characterization of a cDNA coding a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase involved in chlorogenic acid biosynthesis in lonicera japonica	The flower buds of Lonicera japonica are widely used in Chinese medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. The reason why L. japonica has potent and significant effects is that it contains various active components, especially chlorogenic acid (CGA). In the present study, we isolated a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT) gene encoding a protein of 439 amino acids from L. japonica. The RTPCR results showed that tissue distribution of HQT was in accordance with the pattern of CGA content. The corresponding cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins. Recombinant HQT exhibited catalysis activity in esterification of quinic acid with caffeoyl-CoA to generate CGA. Purified proteins demonstrated similar kinetic properties as HQT isolated from other species. This work is of significance for further studies concerned with strengthening the efficacy of L. japonica by means of improved CGA content and exploring the biosynthesis of CGA in vitro. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

78649719820	The clinicopathological significance of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-/low</sup> and CD24<sup>+</sup> tumor cells in invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast	Breast cancer cells with a CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-/low</sup> phenotype have been suggested to have tumor-initiating properties. It is unclear whether their presence correlates with clinicopathological features of invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast, an unusual subtype of breast cancer with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. CD44 and CD24 expression was determined by double-staining immunohistochemistry in 103 cases of IMPC and in 94 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The prevalence of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-/low</sup> tumor cells was higher in IMPC than in invasive ductal carcinoma IDC (P=0.018). The CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-/low</sup> tumor cells were also detected in adjacent stroma surrounding the micropapillary structure in 53.4% (55/103) of IMPC, but only in 7.4% (7/94) of stroma of IDC. These tumor cells in stroma of IMPC were positive for vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin, and negative for E-cadherin. The CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-/low</sup> tumor cells in the micropapillary structure of IMPC were associated with those in stroma (P=0.000). Moreover, they were both associated with lymphovascular invasion and extranodal extension, respectively (P<0.05). The proportion of CD24<sup>+</sup> tumor cells was also higher in IMPC than in IDC (P=0.035), and the CD24<sup>+</sup> tumor cells were associated with lymph node metastasis in IMPC (P=0.010). The results suggest that the increased proportion of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-/low</sup> tumor cells and CD24<sup>+</sup> tumor cells and the epithelial mesenchymal transition may play an important role in aggressiveness and high metastatic risk of breast IMPC. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

79951727773	Promoting Effects of Ganoderma lucidum Polysaccharides on B16F10 Cells to Activate Lymphocytes	The immune system in patients with cancer often fails to control tumour growth because of deficient immunogenicity of tumour cells. Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (Gl-PS) are believed to have anti-tumour effects by boosting host immune function. Additionally, Gl-PS may have some direct effects on tumour cells in the activation of lymphocytes, thus enhancing the immunogenicity of tumour cells. We tested the effects of Gl-PS in lymphocyte activation by incubating Gl-PS with a tumour cell line deficient in antigen presentation. Our study showed that Gl-PS can promote B16F10 melanoma cells to induce lymphocyte proliferation, CD69 and FasL expression and IFN-γ production, indicating that Gl-PS can improve the nature of B16F10 cells to activate lymphocytes.

79955535664	Chromosome doubling can increase heat tolerance in Lonicera japonica as indicated by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging	Imaging fluorometry was applied to investigate the tolerance of Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.) of different ploidy levels to heat stress. Seedlings of L. japonica, the diploid cv. Damaohua and the tetraploid cv. Jiufengyihao, were exposed to heat stress of 42 °C for 6 h and a recovery for 10 h. Heat stress significantly decreased maximum photochemical efficiency, electron transport rate, effective quantum yield of photosystem 2, and photochemical quenching of both cultivars, but it decreased the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) only in the tetraploid. Heat stress increased the content of total soluble sugars, proline, and malondialdehyde in both cultivars while it increased NPQ only in the diploid. Our findings suggest that the tetraploid showed to be more resistance to heat stress than the diploid of L. japonica, which was indicated by different chlorophyll fluorescence imaging techniques and metabolic changes. Moreover, the degree of recovery in the tetraploid was higher than that of the diploid. The tetraploid also possessed thicker epidermis (both upper and lower) and palisade tissue as well as denser pubescence. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79954616095	Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides antagonize the suppression on lymphocytes induced by culture supernatants of B16F10 melanoma cells	Objectives Tumour cells produce factors such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that suppress the function of immune cells or induce apoptosis of immune cells. One of the most important goals of tumour immunotherapy is to antagonize this suppression on immune cells. Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (Gl-PS) may have this potential. The purpose of this study was to determine the antagonistic effects of Gl-PS on the suppression induced by B16F10 melanoma cell culture supernatant (B16F10-CS) on lymphocytes. Methods Gl-PS was used on lymphocytes incubated with B16F10-CS. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the levels of IL-10, TGF-β1 and VEGF in B16F10-CS. The MTT assay was used to determine the proliferation of lymphocytes. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot assay were used to determine perforin and granzyme B production in lymphocytes. Key findings There were elevated levels of IL-10, TGF-β1 and VEGF in B16F10-CS. The lymphocyte proliferation, and perforin and granzyme B production in lymphocytes after induction with phytohemagglutinin, as well as lymphocyte proliferation in the mixed lymphocyte reaction, were suppressed by B16F10-CS. This suppression was fully or partially antagonized by Gl-PS. Conclusions B16F10-CS suppressed lymphocyte proliferation and perforin and granzyme B production in lymphocytes after induction with phytohemagglutinin, as well as lymphocyte proliferation in the mixed lymphocyte reaction. This suppression may be associated with elevated levels of immunosuppressive IL-10, TGF-β1 and VEGF in B16F10-CS. Gl-PS had antagonistic effects on the immunosuppression induced by B16F10-CS, suggesting the potential for Gl-PS in cancer immunotherapy. © 2011 The Authors. JPP © 2011 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

79955776034	Effect of water deficit on biomass production and accumulation of secondary metabolites in roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis	Two-year-old seedlings of licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch) were exposed to three degrees of water deficit, namely weak (60-70%), moderate (40-50%), and strong (20-30%) relative water content in soil, whereas control plants were grown in soil with 80-90% water content. Moderate and strong water deficit decreased the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and biomass production. Water use efficiency and the root-to-shoot ratio increased significantly in response to water deficit, indicating a high tolerance to drought. Weak water deficit did not decrease root biomass production, but significantly increased the production of glycyrrhizic acid (by 89%) and liquiritin (by 125%) in the roots. Therefore, a weak water deficit can increase the yield of root medical compounds without negative effect on root growth. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

79959193633	Nipple involvement in breast cancer: Retrospective analysis of 2323 consecutive mastectomy specimens	Breast cancer surgical options now include nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM), but there has been much controversy regarding the oncologic safety of the preserved nipple. This study evaluates frequency and patterns of occult nipple involvement in a large contemporary cohort of patients, aiming to improve patient selection for NSM. A total of 2323 consecutive mastectomy specimens with grossly unremarkable nipples were evaluated by sagittal sections through the entire nipple and subareolar tissue. Sixteen different clinical and tumor parameters were examined to predict cancerous nipple involvement. Nipple involvement was noted in 331 of 2323 (14.2%) mastectomy specimens. Occult nipple involvement rate was 10.7% (248 cases). Occult nipple involvement usually occurs as ductal carcinoma in situ. In univariate analysis, patient age, tumor size, tumor-to-nipple distance, tumor central location, tumor type, lymph node status, lymphatic vascular invasion, histologic grade, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) amplification, and multicentric or multifocal tumor were associated with positive nipple involvement. By multivariate logistic regression analysis with the entire selection process, tumor size, tumor-to-nipple distance, central location, lymph node status, lymphatic vascular invasion, HER-2 amplification, and multicentric or multifocal tumor were shown to be associated with nipple involvement by carcinoma. Nearly 90% women undergoing mastectomy did not have occult nipple involvement. NSM may be a viable option in appropriate patient selection and setting. NAC preservation would be appropriate in HER-2 negative, axillary lymph node, and lymphatic vascular negative patients with small, solitary tumors located on the periphery of the breast. © The Author(s) 2011.

80052383506	Overexpression of glucose-regulated protein 94 after spinal cord injury in rats	Glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 94 is a member of the stress protein family, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Spinal cord injury (SCI) induced ER stress that results in apoptosis. However, the role of GRP94 in injury of the central nervous system remains unknown. In this study, we performed SCI in adult rats and investigated acutely the protein expression and cellular localization of GRP94 in the spinal cord. Western blot analysis revealed that GRP94 was low in normal spinal cord. It rose at 6 h after SCI, peaked at 1 day, remained for another 3 days, then declined to basal levels at 5 days after injury. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed that GRP94 immunoactivity was expressed at low levels in gray matter and white matter in normal condition and increased after SCI. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that GRP94 was co-expressed with NeuN (neuronal marker), and GFAP (astroglial marker). In addition, caspase-12, caspase-3 and phospho-c-Jun NH2-kinase (p-JNK) levels increased at 6 h, peaked at 1 day, and then gradually reduced to normal levels for 2 weeks after SCI by western blot analysis. Co-localization of GRP94/caspase-12 and GRP94/p-JNK was detected in neurons and glial cells. Taken together, these data suggest GRP94 involvement in the injury response of the adult spinal cord of the rats. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

80054962373	Abnormal expression of Nek2 and β-catenin in breast carcinoma: Clinicopathological correlations	Abnormal expression of Nek2 and β-catenin in breast carcinoma: clinicopathological correlations Aims: NIMA-related kinase 2 (Nek2) and β-catenin are important centrosome regulatory factors. The aim of this study was to detect the possible disparity in their expression among normal breast tissue, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), concomitant ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and pure DCIS, and to explore its correlation with clinicopathological factors. Methods and results: We used immunohistochemistry to detect protein expression of Nek2 and β-catenin in breast cancer tissues from 60 cases of pure DCIS, 348 cases of IDC and 137 cases of concomitant DCIS with that in normal breast tissues from the same 137 concomitant DCIS patients as controls. As compared with normal tissue, expression of Nek2 and β-catenin in the cytoplasm was significantly increased in IDC and DCIS (P<0.05), and variation in expression was also observed in different grades of IDC (P<0.01). Also, cytoplasmic expression of Nek2 and and of β-catenin were correlated with each other in IDC and DCIS (P<0.01). In addition, they were both related to Ki67 immunoreactivity (P<0.05). Furthermore, our study also revealed a correlation between their expression and some clinicopathological factors. We found that Nek2 cytoplasmic expression was associated with grade and tumour size (P<0.01) in IDC, whereas β-catenin cytomembrane expression showed significant variation with grades, TNM stages, lymphoid node status, oestrogen receptor status, and molecular subtype (P<0.05); a difference in expression was also observed between IDC and DCIS (P<0.05). Also, β-catenin cytoplasmic expression was associated with TNM stage (P<0.05). Expression of Nek2 at the mRNA level was detected in 50 pairs of breast cancer specimens and matched normal tissues by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the result showed increased expression in IDC. Conclusions: This study suggests that abnormal expression of Nek2 and β-catenin might be one of the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, especially of abnormal tumour proliferation. They may represent new potential targets for therapeutic intervention. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Limited.

The rates for LRP- and MRPpositive tumours among the NSCLC cases were 54% and 59%, respectively, and their combined positive rate was 45%. These rates were significantly higher than in normal lung tissue. The rates of LRP- and MRP-positive tumours were significantly higher among cases of adenocarcinoma than in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, and in highly differentiated tumours compared with tumours of low or moderate differentiation. There was a significant association between LRP- and MRP-positive tumours and a decrease in overall survival.

Methods Effects on epithelial cell proliferation, migration, morphology of differentiation and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) protein expression, as well as the cellular ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA and c-Myc mRNA expression, were assessed, respectively, by MTT assay, wound model in vitro, observation under a microscope after hematoxylin and eosin staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. Key findings It was shown that Gl-PS stimulated IEC-6 cell proliferation and migration significantly in a dose-dependent manner; 10 μg/ml Gl-PS improved the morphology of differentiation in IEC-6 cells. Inefficacy in expression of TGF-β in IEC-6 cells indicated a possible TGF-β independent action of Gl-PS. However, Gl-PS increased ODC mRNA and c-Myc mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating, at least partially possible involvement of ODC and c-Myc gene expression in improvement of intestinal wound healing. Conclusions These results suggest the potential usefulness of Gl-PS to cure intestinal disorders characterized by injury and ineffective repair of the intestinal mucosa. © 2011 The Authors.

82655184179	Increased expression of CD146 and microvessel density (MVD) in invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast: Comparative study with invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified	Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is a rare variant of ductal carcinoma of the breast, and is characterized by a high metastatic potential and an aggressive clinical course. Studies of CD146 expression and function in breast cancer remain scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CD146 and microvessel density (MVD) in breast IMPC. CD146 mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry for CD146 and MVD measured by CD31 were assessed in 82 cases of IMPC and 137 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS). The mRNA level of CD146 in cancer specimens was higher in IMPC than in IDC-NOS. CD146 expression in tumor cells was up-regulated in IMPC as compared with that in IDC-NOS, and was positively correlated with histological grade, ER, PR status, and P53 expression in IMPC and IDC-NOS. CD146 expression in vascular endothelial cells was significantly higher than that in IDC, and was positively correlated with tumor progression in IMPC and IDC-NOS. MVD in IMPC was significantly higher than that in IDC. CD146 expression in tumor cells was positively correlated with that in vascular endothelial cells of IMPC and IDC-NOS. The association of CD146 expression with MVD and its correlation with progression in breast carcinoma indicated that CD146 is a potentially useful prognostic marker for breast cancer. CD146 could be a new drug target in the treatment of breast cancer. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

83555160945	Sinomenine reduces invasion and migration ability in fibroblast-like synoviocytes cells co-cultured with activated human monocytic THP-1 cells by inhibiting the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, CD147	CD147 expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and synoviocytes cells can stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) associated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the effects of Sinomenine (SIN) on invasion and migration ability and gene expression of CD147, MMP-2, MMP-9 of fibroblast-like synoviocytes cells (FLS) co-cultured with activated human monocytic THP-1 cells (A-THP-1) in vitro. SIN is a pure alkaloid extracted from the Chinese medical plant Sinomenium acutum. FLS cells were co-cultured with THP-1 cells which were induced to differentiate into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Cells were treated with different concentrations of SIN. Invasion and migration ability of cells was tested by transwell assays. Western blot analysis and zymographic analysis were adopted to detect the expression of CD147 and MMPs, respectively. RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of mRNA of CD147, MMP-2, and MMP-9. The invasion and migration ability of the co-cultured cells was significantly inhibited by SIN in a concentration-dependent fashion, and at the same time, the levels of CD147, MMP-2, MMP-9 were markedly down-regulated. This inhibitory effect was most notable at concentrations of 0.25 and 1.00 mM (P < 0.01). Our results point to a possible mechanism of SIN on treatment of RA is the inhibitory effect of SIN on cell invasion and migration ability, which strongly correlates with repressing the expression of CD147, MMP-2, and MMP-9. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

82955194985	Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides reduce methotrexate-induced small intestinal damage in mice via induction of epithelial cell proliferation and migration	Aim: To study the effects of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (Gl-PS) on methotrexate (MTX)-induced small intestinal damage in mice and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: BALB/c mice were used for in vivo study. The mice were administered with Gl-PS (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg, ig) for 10 d, and injected with MTX (50 mg/kg, ip) on d 7 and 8 to induce intestinal damage, and then sacrificed on d 11 for morphological study and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) measurements. Before sacrificing, blood samples were collected to analyze immunoglobulin A (IgA). Rat intestinal IEC-6 cells were used for in vitro study. Cell proliferation and migration were assessed using MTT method and an in vitro wounding model, respectively. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) protein expression was determined using ELISA assay. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and c-Myc mRNA expression profiles were determined using RT-PCR. Results: MTX treatment caused severe mucosal damage, significantly increased small intestine MDA levels, and decreased SOD and serum IgA levels in BALB/c mice. Gl-PS (100 and 200 mg/kg) markedly reversed the MTX effects. In IEC-6 cells, Gl-PS (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/mL) significantly stimulated the cell proliferation. Furthermore, Gl-PS (10 μg/mL) significantly stimulated the cell migration. In addition, Gl-PS (10 and 20 μg/mL) significantly increased the expression of ODC and c-Myc mRNAs. However, Gl-PS (up to 20 μg/mL) had no effect on the expression of TGFβ protein. Conclusion: The results suggest that Gl-PS protects small intestine against MTX-induced injury via induction of epithelial cell proliferation and migration. © 2011 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.

84855216546	Inhibition of colon tumor growth by IL-15 immunogene therapy	Interleukin-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has potential for cancer immunegene therapy. We previously reported the construction and characterization of IL-15 overexpression vectors pHi2-IL15-CMV-tat (L1) and pHi2-spIL15-CMV-tat (L3), as well as carcinoembryonic antigen promoter-amplified IL-15 expression plasmid vectors pHi2-IL15-CEA-tat (L2) and pHi2-spIL15-CEA-tat (L4). In the current study, we evaluated the expression and therapeutic efficacy of these vectors using a mouse colon carcinoma model. Plasmid vectors were transfected into SW480 and MCF-7 cells, and IL-15 overexpression was confirmed. IL-15 expressed by transfected tumor cells stimulated spleen cell proliferation in vitro. Intraperitoneal injection of plasmid pHi2-spIL15-CMV-tat (L3) into mice resulted in transgene expression by peritoneal mesothelial cells, inhibited CT-26 tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, the in vivo transfection of plasmid pHi2-spIL15-CMV-tat (L3) via electroporation slowed the tumor formation of subcutaneously inoculated CT-26 cells. These data suggest that IL-15 overexpression achieves therapeutic effects in a mouse cancer model and that these gene transfer approaches should be further evaluated for use in the treatment of human cancers.

84859121913	Epigenetic Silencing of miR-203 Upregulates SNAI2 and Contributes to the Invasiveness of Malignant Breast Cancer Cells	It has become increasingly clear that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Recently, miR-203 was reported as a suppressor microRNA often silenced in different malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, oral cancer, and hematopoietic malignancy, but little is known about its potential role in breast carcinogenesis. In this study, we found that in breast cancer, miR-203 was upregulated in primary tumors and some nonmetastatic cell lines but was significantly downregulated in metastatic cell lines including BT549, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-231, as measured by regular and real-time PCR. Downregulation of miR-203 in metastatic breast cancer cells appeared to be caused by hypermethylation of its promoter. Functionally, ectopic expression of miR-203 in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibited cell invasion and migration in vitro. Bioinformatic analysis predicted the snail homolog 2 (SNAI2 or SLUG), a transcription factor that promotes cell invasion and tumor metastasis, as a target of miR-203, and the prediction was validated by expression analysis and luciferase reporter assay of the 3′ untranslated region of SNAI2 that contains the miR-203 target sequences. These results suggest that in malignant breast cancer cells, miR-203 is epigenetically silenced, and the silencing promotes tumor cell growth and invasion at least in part by upregulating the SNAI2 transcription factor. © The Author(s) 2011.

84859569810	Nek2A contributes to tumorigenic growth and possibly functions as potential therapeutic target for human breast cancer	Nek2A (NIMA-related kinases 2A) has been known as an important centrosome regulatory factor. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of Nek2A and the role it played in different stages of breast cancer. We detected the expression of Nek2A in both mRNA and protein levels in MCF10 cell lines including MCF-10A, MCF-10DCIS.com, MCF-10CA1a and in human breast samples which contained normal breast tissue (NBT), breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Our study revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of Nek2A were significantly up-regulated in MCF-10DCIS.com and MCF-10CA1a cell lines as well as in human primary breast cancer tissue (DCIS and IDC). Our study also presented a correlation between Nek2A mRNA expression and some clinic pathological factors. We found that Nek2A mRNA expression was associated with molecular subtypes, ER, PR and Ki-67 immunoreactivity (P < 0.05) in DCIS and associated with histological grade, lymph node metastasis, molecular subtypes, c-erbB-2, and Ki-67 expression (P < 0.05) in IDC. In addition, we observed that ectopic expression of Nek2A in "normal" immortalized MCF-10A breast epithelial cell resulted in increased Nek2A which lead to abnormal centrosomes. Furthermore, knockdown of Nek2A in MCF-10DCIS.com could remarkably inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in MCF-10DCIS.com cell line. These data suggested that Nek2A might bear a close relationship with development and progression of breast carcinoma, and highlighted its role as a novel potential biomarker for diagnosis and a possible therapeutic target for human breast cancer especially for DCIS. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84859649503	Il-15 gene therapy inhibited experimental liver metastases of colon cancer	Liver metastases are common for colon cancer and associate with poor prognosis. Interleukin-15 is considered to be one of the most promising cytokine for cancer gene therapy based on its activity on both innate and adaptive immunity. This study investigated the effect of IL-15 immune gene therapy on metastatic liver disease of colon cancer in murine model. IL-15 overexpression plasmid vector was transfected into CT-26 cells in vitro by lipofection and into mice in vivo by intravenous injection. IL-15 expression was detected by ELISA. The impact of IL-15 on T cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Murine model of CT-26 colon cancer liver metastases were established and the effect of IL-15 gene therapy on liver metastasis of colon cancer were determined. Results showed that IL-15 was detected in the supernatant of IL-15-overexpression plasmid transfected mouse CT-26 cells. Transgene expression was observed in the liver tissue after intravenous injection of IL-15-overexpression plasmid. IL-15 expression in vivo increased the proportion of CD3+CD8+ cells in peripheral blood of mice. Decreased liver metastases indicated by liver weight were observed in IL-15 gene therapy group. The survival time of mice in IL-15 gene therapy group is also significantly prolonged. In conclusion, IL-15 gene therapy inhibits experimental colon cancer liver metastases, prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice. IL-15 gene therapy provides a new approach for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases and is worth further evaluation.

84860159426	NMDA receptor hypofunction induces dysfunctions of energy metabolism and semaphorin signaling in rats: A synaptic proteome study	There is considerable evidence to suggest that aberrations of synapse connectivity contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate transmission is especially important. Administration of MK-801 ([+]-5-methyl-10, 11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a, d]-cycloheptene-5, 10-iminehydrogenmaleate) induces hypofunction of NMDA receptors in rats, which are widely used as a model for schizophrenia. We investigated synaptosomal proteome expression profiling of the cerebral cortex of MK-801-treated Sprague-Dawley rats using the 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis method, and 49 differentially expression proteins were successfully identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight/Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry. We carried out a literature search for further confirmation of subsynaptic locations and to explore the relevance to the diseases of differentially expressed proteins. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was used to further examine the underlying relationship between the changed proteins. The network encompassing "cell morphology, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, nervous system development and function" was found to be significantly altered in the MK-801-treated rats. "Energy metabolism" and "semaphorin signaling in neurons" are the most significant IPA canonical pathways to be affected by MK-801 treatment. Using western blots, we confirmed the differential expression of Camk2a, Crmp2, Crmp5, Dnm1, and Ndufs3 in both synaptosome proteins and total proteins in the cerebral cortex of the rats. Our study identified the change and/or response of the central nervous transmission system under the stress of NMDA hypofunction, underlining the importance of the synaptic function in schizophrenia. © 2010 The Author.

84860252660	Xanthatin induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis via disrupting NF-κB pathway in A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cells	Xanthatin, a natural sesquiterpene lactone, has significant antitumor activity against a variety of cancer cells, yet little is known about its anticancer mechanism. In this study, we demonstrated that xanthatin had obvious dose-/time-dependent cytotoxicity against the human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549. Flow cytometry analysis showed xanthatin induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Xanthatin also had pro-apoptotic effects on A549 cells as evidenced by Hoechst 33258 staining and annexin V-FITC staining. Mechanistic data revealed that xanthatin downregulated Chk1, Chk2, and phosphorylation of CDC2, which contributed to the cell cycle arrest. Xathatin also increased total p53 protein levels, decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio and expression of the downstream factors procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, which triggered the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, xanthatin blocked phosphorylation of NF-κB (p65) and IκBα, which might also contribute to its pro-apoptotic effects on A549 cells. Xanthatin also inhibited TNFα induced NF-κB (p65) translocation. We conclude that xanthatin displays significant antitumor effects through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in A549 cells. These effects were associated with intrinsic apoptosis pathway and disrupted NF-κB signaling. These results suggested that xanthatin may have therapeutic potential against NSCLC. © 2012 by the authors.

84860611228	Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 plays a tumor suppressor role in human breast cancer	Introduction: The chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) has recently been identified as a tumor suppressor in a mouse model. The CHD5 locus at 1p36 is deleted, and its mutation has been detected in breast cancer. We, therefore, evaluated whether CHD5 plays a role in human breast cancer.Methods: We screened mutations in 55 tumors, determined promoter methylation in 39 tumors, measured RNA expression in 90 tumors, analyzed protein expression in 289 tumors, and correlated expression changes with clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer. Functional effects of CHD5 on cell proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis were also tested.Results: Although only one mutation was detected, CHD5 mRNA expression was significantly reduced, accompanied by frequent genomic deletion and promoter methylation, in breast cancer. The extent of methylation was significantly associated with reduced mRNA expression, and demethylating treatment restored CHD5 expression. Lower CHD5 mRNA levels correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.026). CHD5 protein expression was also reduced in breast cancer, and lack of CHD5 expression significantly correlated with higher tumor stage, ER/PR-negativity, HER2 positivity, distant metastasis and worse patient survival (P ≤ 0.01). Functionally, ectopic expression of CHD5 in breast cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Consistent with the inhibition of invasion, CHD5 down-regulated mesenchymal markers vimentin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 in breast cancer cells.Conclusion: Down-regulation of CHD5, mediated at least in part by promoter methylation, contributes to the development and progression of human breast cancer. © 2012 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84861130194	Ginkgolide B inhibits renal cyst development in in vitro and in vivo cyst models	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disease characterized by massive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney. However, there is no effective therapy yet for this disease. To examine whether ginkgolide B, a natural compound, inhibits cyst development, a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cyst model, an embryonic kidney cyst model, and a PKD mouse model were used. Interestingly, ginkgolide B significantly inhibited MDCK cyst formation dose dependently, with up to 69% reduction by 2μM ginkgolide B. Ginkgolide B also significantly inhibited cyst enlargement in the MDCK cyst model, embryonic kidney cyst model, and PKD mouse model. To determine the underlying mechanisms, the effect of ginkgolide B on MDCK cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, chloride transporter CFTR activity, and intracellular signaling pathways were also studied. Ginkgolide B did not affect cell viability, proliferation, and expression and activity of the chloride transporter CFTR that mediates cyst fluid secretion. Ginkgolide B induced cyst cell differentiation and altered the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ginkgolide B inhibits renal cyst formation and enlargement, suggesting that ginkgolide B might be developed into a novel candidate drug for ADPKD. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.

84862517944	Xanthatin induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma MKN-45 cells	Xanthatin, a natural bioactive compound of sesquiterpene lactones, was isolated and purified from air-dried aerial part of Xanthium sibiricum Patrin ex Widder. In the present study, we demonstrated the significant antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of xanthatin on human gastric carcinoma MKN-45 cells. MTS assay showed that xanthatin produced obvious cytotoxicity in MKN-45 cells with ICvalues of 18.6, 9.3, and 3.9 M for 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. Results of flow cytometry analysis indicated that the antiproliferative activity induced by xanthatin might be executed via G2/M cell cycle arrest and proapoptosis in MKN-45 cells. Western blot analysis elucidated that: a) xanthatin downregulated expression of Chk1 and Chk2 and phosphorylation of CDC2, which are known as key G2/M transition regulators; b) xanthatin increased p53 activation, decreased the bcl-2/bax ratio and the levels of downstream procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, which are key regulators in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway; c) xanthatin blocked phosphorylation of NF-κB (p65 subunit) and of IκBα, which might contribute to its proapoptotic effects on MKN-45 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that xanthatin may have therapeutic potential against human gastric carcinoma. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

84862069266	Novel materials which possess the ability to target liver cells	Introduction: Hepatic-targeted drug delivery systems are designed to treat diseases of the liver. However, since there are several different types of liver diseases that are caused by different cells, it is important to select the proper materials to target these different cells. Areas covered: This review addresses novel materials that possess the ability to target liver cells via receptorligand processes and offers an insight into the aspects of formulation design. It also discusses several approaches used to enhance the targeting efficiency of drug delivery systems to receptors in the liver cells. In addition, the delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy of these materials in the treatment of acute or chronic liver diseases is highlighted. Expert opinion: Further research into the use of clinical materials and the design of smart materials for multi-drug delivery to different organelles is important for future studies on these new materials. It is hoped that these targeted therapeutics will benefit patients with liver disorders in the near future. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

84862815927	Stronger cytotoxicity in CTLs with granzyme B and porforin was induced by Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides acting on B16F10 cells	Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) exert cytotoxicity against tumor cells with granzyme B and porforin (two important components for cytotoxicity). One main reason for the limitation of clinical success in tumor immunotherapy is tumor cell inefficacy in inducing sufficient immune responses, such as efficient CTLs, and subsequently sufficient granzyme B and porforin activity because of weak immunogenicity of the tumor cells. It is therefore important to boost tumor cells to induce efficient CTLs and sufficient granzyme B and porforin. We suggest that Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (Gl-PS), with multiple bioactivities have this potential. We have shown that after incubation with Gl-PS, B16F10 melanoma cells, which are deficient in antigen presentation, promoted cytotoxicity of CTLs against B16F10 cells, induced more granzyme B and porforin in CTLs, decreased the in vivo incidence of tumorigenesis 15 days after inoculation and prolonged the latency of tumorigenesis 21 days after inoculation, demonstrating that the effects of Gl-PS on B16F10 cells induced stronger immune responses against tumor cells. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84862259255	Expression of the recepteur d'originenantais receptor tyrosine kinase in non-small cell lung cancer and its clinical significance	Background Recepteur d'originenantais (RON) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that belongs to the MET proto-oncogene family. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of RON receptor tyrosine kinase in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its relationship with clinical pathology of NSCLC and prognosis. Methods RON protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 96 NSCLC specimens was evaluated and compared with the clinical pathology and prognosis, and 20 paraneoplastic tissues were included as controls. RON mRNA and protein expression in 25 fresh tissue samples of lung cancer and 10 normal lung tissues were also analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Results The rate of positive RON expression differed significantly between NSCLC tissues (55.2%, 53/96) and paraneoplastic tissues (5%, 1/20) (P <0.001). RON protein expression was not found to be associated with gender or age. However, RON expression positively correlated with clinical TNM stage (P=0.004), histological types (P=0.001), lymph node metastasis (P=0.012) and differentiation (P=0.035). RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis also confirmed that the expression of RON mRNA and protein was significantly increased in the NSCLC tissues versus normal tissues. In addition, RON expression was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC (P=0.045). Conclusions The expression of RON protein and mRNA is significant in human NSCLC and low in para-neoplastic and normal tissues. Elevated RON expression may contribute to the occurrence, progression and metastasis of NSCLC, inferring that it could be useful as a new prognostic indicator for patients with NSCLC.

84863012785	CD146, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducer, is associated with triple-negative breast cancer	The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in breast cancer metastasis, especially in the most aggressive and lethal subtype, "triple-negative breast cancer" (TNBC). Here, we report that CD146 is a unique activator of EMTs and significantly correlates with TNBC. In epithelial breast cancer cells, over-expression of CD146 down-regulated epithelial markers and up-regulated mesenchymal markers, significantly promoted cell migration and invasion, and induced cancer stem cell-like properties. We further found that RhoA pathways positively regulated CD146-induced EMTs via the key EMT transcriptional factor Slug. An orthotopic breast tumor model demonstrated that CD146-over-expressing breast tumors showed a poorly differentiated phenotype and displayed increased tumor invasion and metastasis. We confirmed these findings by conducting an immunohistochemical analysis of 505 human primary breast tumor tissues and found that CD146 expression was significantly associated with high tumor stage, poor prognosis, and TNBC. CD146 was expressed at abnormally high levels (68.9%), and was strongly associated with E-cadherin down-regulation in TNBC samples. Taken together, these findings provide unique evidence that CD146 promotes breast cancer progression by induction of EMTs via the activation of RhoA and up-regulation of Slug. Thus, CD146 could be a therapeutic target for breast cancer, especially for TNBC.

84863108076	Effect of SOX10 gene polymorphism on early onset schizophrenia in Chinese Han population	Schizophrenia is one of highly heritable psychiatric disorders. Patients with early onset schizophrenia tend to have a greater genetic loading and may be an attractive subpopulation for genetics studies. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs139887 in sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10), a candidate gene for schizophrenia, was suggested to be associated with schizophrenia although inconsistent results had been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between SOX10 rs139887 polymorphism and schizophrenia using an early onset sample in the Chinese Han population. A total of 321 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 400 healthy controls were recruited for association study. In addition, two populations involved in three studies were selected for meta-analysis to determine the effect of rs139887 on schizophrenia. Our association study results showed that the allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different between schizophrenic patients and controls (P= 0.013 and P= 0.034, respectively). Interestingly, a significant association in allele and genotype frequencies were found in male patients (P= 0.017 and P= 0.045, respectively), but not female patients. Moreover, the C/C genotype had a significant association with an earlier age of onset in male schizophrenic patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P= 0.029), but not in female patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P= 0.876). The meta-analysis result showed the same C allele was significantly associated with schizophrenia (P= 0.007). In conclusion, the SOX10 rs139887 polymorphism was related to the development of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner, and may be a significant genetic marker for managing subgroups and etiological clues in schizophrenia. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84863424818	Enhanced MHC class i and costimulatory molecules on B16F10 cells by Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides	Purpose: It is obvious that malignant cells evade from immune system in patients with manifest malignancy. Deficient major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and costimulatory molecules on malignant cells partially consist of evasion strategy since antigen bond MHC and costimulatory molecules provide two signals necessary for T cell activation. Therefore, enhancement of MHC-I and costimulatory molecules may favor restraint of the evasion.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of rs17782313 with obesity and BMI in the Chinese Han population. We also sought to extend previous studies by determining whether this SNP is associated with plasma lipid levels in the Chinese Han population. Rs17782313 was genotyped in two independent Chinese Han cohorts (Cohort1: n = 2533; Cohort2: n = 2105). In our study, rs17782313 did not show significant association with either obesity or BMI in the Chinese Han population, but showed evidence for association with LDL-C (P ∼ 0.003) and TC (P ∼ 0.001). Our findings indicate that the variant rs17782313 near MC4R is likely to have an impact on plasma lipid levels of LDL-C and TC in the Chinese Han population. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

However, the localization and clinical significance of 14-3-3ε in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been elucidated. Methods We investigated 14-3-3ε expression and its prognostic significance in CRC. CRC surgical samples were taken from 137 clinicopathologically characterized CRC cases. 14-3-3ε expression was tested by immunohistochemical assay. Separate Western blot of nuclear and cytosol preparations confirmed nuclear localization of 14-3-3ε protein. Results Nuclear expression of 14-3-3ε was observed in 76.9% of normal colorectal tissue and 78.8% of all CRC samples. Statistical analysis showed that there was significant difference of nuclear 14-3-3ε expression in patients categorized according to lymph node metastasis. A trend was identified between decreasing nuclear 14-3-3ε expression in CRC and worsening clinical prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that loss of nuclear 14-3-3ε expression was an independent prognostic indicator for patient's survival. Conclusions The current data provide evidence that 14-3-3ε is not exclusively a cytosolic protein, but is also detectable within the nucleus. Our results suggest that nuclear 14-3-3ε as a suppressor may serve as important biomarker of tumor metastasis. Loss of nuclear 14-3-3ε is closely associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84865957722	Promotion of myelopoiesis in myelosuppressed mice by Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides	Our previous studies demonstrated that Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (Gl-PS) exhibit potent immunomodulating effects. Immunomodulation plays an important role in hematopoiesis. To investigate the possible mechanism by which Gl-PS promote myelopoiesis during myelosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once daily with 2.5 mg/kg of Gl-PS for 10 days and were treated i.p. once daily with cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) on days 2 through 4. In the present study in vivo and in vitro, we find that Gl-PS selectively bind to bone marrow stromal cells, stimulate the secretion of hematopoietic growth factors, and enhance the clonogenic activities of hematopoietic and stromal cells to promote hematopoiesis in myelosuppressed mice. © 2012 Zhu, Liu, Li and Lin.

84865507295	Experience of simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting and lung lobectomy	Aim. To summarize the experience of surgical indications and treatment of coronary heart disease patients with lung disease who need coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and lung (lobe) resection at the same time. Methods. In the period 2008 to 2010, 3 patients with lung tumor accepted non-cardiac arrest simultaneous CABG and lung (lobe) resection. Lung cancer TNM stage was IB in 1 case, HA in 1, and IIB in 1. Coronary angiography showed 2 patients had disease of all 3 coronary arteries; the other had left main coronary artery and anterior descending artery disease. Internal mammary artery and left anterior descending artery anastomosis and saphenous vein bypass graft surgery were performed. Meanwhile, all 3 cases underwent lobectomy plus lymph node dissection. We analyzed indicators for preoperative evaluation of cardiopulmonary function and the basis of surgical indications. Results. All 3 patients underwent surgery smoothly, the perioperative period was uneventful, cardiopulmonary function recovered well, and all 3 patients were cured. Pathological diagnosis of pulmonary disease were adenocarcinoma in 1 patient and squamous cell carcinoma in 2; the TNM stage was IB in 1 case, HA in 1, and HB in 1. Conclusion. Non-cardiac arrest simultaneous CABG and lung (lobe) resection surgery should be based strictly on surgical indications, and sound perioperative management principles. Simultaneous surgical treatment is safe and feasible.

84865810937	Development of brucine-loaded microsphere/thermally responsive hydrogel combination system for intra-articular administration	Intra-articular drug delivery system could directly deliver a drug to an affected joint and offer the possibility of reaching high drug concentrations at the site of action with limited systemic toxicity. However, depending on their chemical structure, some active compounds were rapidly cleared from the joint, thus requiring numerous injections, which could cause infection or joint disability. To control the release behavior for prolonged time periods, a novel biologically based drug delivery vehicle was designed for intra-articular using microsphere/thermally responsive hydrogel combination system in this paper. And brucine was the test drug. The system was constructed by dispersing the brucine microspheres which was prepared by using a spray-drying method in a thermally responsive biopolymer hydrogel contained with chitosan-glycerol-borax. The microspheres were spherical as evidenced by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs. And the entrapment rate was 98.60% w/w with an average size range of 0.9-4.5 μm. Fourier transforms infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the absence of drug-polymer interaction and amorphous nature of an entrapped drug. From the in vitro drug release study we could see that there was a burst release of microsphere, which was obviously retarded when dispersed in hydrogel. And the studies of biocompatibility with synovium showed that no apparent thickening or hyperplasia of the synovium, a small quality of phlogocyte imbibitions was observed. The results of FX imaging in rats showed that by intra-articular injection the BMH could stay in articular for over 7 days were consistent with our in vitro release. And the results of pharmacodynamics revealed the BMH could benefit OA joint by suppressing the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, protect the damaged joint from degradation. The novel microsphere/thermoresponsive hydrogel combination system could be a promising treatment option for OA and RA. In conclusion, the system appears to be generally biocompatible with synovium and could control the drug release for several days; hence it might be suitable for the development of treatment strategies for rheumatic diseases. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84866510665	Association of the CR1 polymorphism with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han populations: A meta-analysis	It is well known that genetic variants play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 2009, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6656401, in complement receptor 1 (CR1) is significantly associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasian population. Subsequently, other researchers have attempted to validate this finding in Chinese Han populations. However, these findings in Chinese Han populations have produced both negative and positive results. To derive a more precise estimation for the relationship, we performed the present meta-analysis by analyzing three published association studies involving CR1 SNP rs6656401 through the use of the RevMan (v.5.1) program. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for allele contrasts (A vs. G) and a dominant model [(AA. +. AG) vs. GG] in three studies that included 1019 cases and 1080 controls, respectively. The statistical results showed a significant difference between patients and controls for the A allele of CR1 SNP rs6656401 (P= 0.005). In addition, carriers of the A allele (AA. +. AG) of rs6656401 had a 1.69-fold increased risk for LOAD compared with non-carriers (GG) (P= 0.01). In conclusion, despite there are some limitations, this meta-analysis indicates that the A allele of the CR1 SNP rs6656401 is significantly associated with LOAD susceptibility in Chinese Han populations. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84867997006	Clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis for molecular subtypes in low-grade breast carcinoma: Comparison with grade one invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified	The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis value for molecular subtypes of low-grade breast carcinoma (LGBC) compared with grade one invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified (G1-IDC-NOS). A retrospective review of 688 LGBC and 1 037 G1-IDC-NOS patients was classified into four different molecular subtypes based on the IHC-based definitions for ER, PR, and c-erbB-2. In LGBC, lymph node metastasis, the percentage of III/IV TNM stages, the expression of Ki-67 and p53 in luminal A subtype were lower than in other subtypes (P < 0.01). In addition, the variations of Ki-67 and p53 expression were observed in different subtypes of G1-IDC-NOS (P < 0.01). Compared with G1-IDC-NOS, LGBC has higher proportion in the ER positive, PR positive, HER-2 negative, luminal A subtype, Ki-67 negative, and lymph nodes negative group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the overall survival of luminal A and luminal B is higher than triple-negative and HER-2/neu subtype both in LGBC and G1-IDC-NOS in 262 LGBC and 330 G1-IDC-NOS patients with proper follow-up. The classification of molecular subtype together with clinicopathologic factors can significantly improve the traditional prognosticators in predicting outcome for LGBC and G1-IDC-NOS. And it may contribute to guide the treatment for LGBC and G1-IDC-NOS in the future. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84867635450	Overexpression of ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK) accelerates tumor growth by inhibiting apoptosis of breast cancer cells and is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients	Background: Ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK), a mitochondrial isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK), is a central controller of cellular energy homeostasis. Overexpression of uMtCK has been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis for several tumors. The aim of this study was to assess its association with breast cancer (BCa) and to further investigate its underlying mechanisms. Method: We first detected uMtCK expression by immunohistochemistry in human BCa tissues and assessed the association with the prognosis of patients. We then evaluated uMtCK expression in crowded and normal condition cultures of several human BCa cell lines. After two stable clones of the MDA-MB-231 cell line with high expression of uMtCK were established, cell growth, apoptosis and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway protein expression were measured in these clones. Finally, tumorigenicity of the above cells was assessed using nude mice to explore the relationship between uMtCK expression and tumor progression. Results: uMtCK expression was detected in 85.5% (47 of 55) of the invasive ductal carcinomas of breast tissue, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS). Expression in BCa tissue was significantly associated with reduced progression-free survival (PFS; P= 0.019) and overall survival (OS; P= 0.022) of the patients. Up-regulation of uMtCK expression was identified in crowded BCa cells in culture, and the number of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased in uMtCK transfected MDA-MB-231 cell clones (P< 0.01). Stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and down regulation of cytochrome c (cyt c) and activated caspase 9, two components of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway proteins, were also identified in the same clones when cells were crowded in culture. In vivo studies revealed that the transfected tumor cells with uMtCK overexpression induced faster tumor growth in nude mice, along with accelerated animal body weight loss and a significantly lower tumor apoptotic index (AI) (P< 0.001). Conclusion: The results indicated that uMtCK expression is associated with a poor prognosis in BCa and might serve as a tumor marker. In vivo and In vitro evidence suggests that uMtCK overexpression promotes tumor growth by inhibiting apoptosis of tumor cells through stabilizing ΔΨm and down regulating mitochondrial apoptotic pathway proteins. Exploration of therapeutic agents targeting the expression of uMtCK may have practical value for BCa patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84869120350	Research on the fingerprint of Xanthium sibiricum Patr. harvested at different time	Objective: To establish a stable and reproducible quality control method for Xanthium sibiricum Patr. by studying its fingerprint at different harvest time. Methods: HPLC technology was used to establish the fingerprint of Xanthium sibiricum Patr. collected from different areas at different harvest time. The common pattern was used as the reference. The Traditional Chinese medicine fingerprint similarity calculation software was used to calculate the similarity factors. Results: By comparing the HPLC chromatograms of 14 batches of Xanthium sibiricum Patr. and 2 batches of Xanthium fruits, the reference fingerprint was established. The similarities between the samples of batch 1, 15 and 16 with other batches were not high, while the similarities among other batches were high. However, the contents of the main component were different, which was related with the harvest periods. Conclusion: The HPLC fingerprint of Xanthium sibiricum Patr. has been established in this study, and this has provided the base to establish the quality standards of Xanthium sibiricum Patr.

84870704398	Association study of APC polymorphisms with colorectal cancer in Han Chinese	Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy with worldwide prevalence. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a predisposition syndrome of CRC, is caused by germ line mutations in the APC gene. Mutations in APC are thought to be an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis. We hypothesized that common variants in APC might be associated with CRC. Design and methods: A case-control study genotyping ten SNPs was conducted in 312 CRC patients and 270 normal controls in the Chinese Han population. Results: The genotype frequency of rs2019720 showed a significant difference between cases and controls (p = 0.046, after Bonferroni correction). For the three pairs of SNPs in strong LD, we carried out haplotype analyses but no significant association was detected. Conclusion: Our results suggest that APC polymorphisms might be associated with CRC in the Chinese Han population. © 2012 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

84871588160	Cloning and Characterization of the Human USP22 Gene Promoter	Ubiquitin-specific processing enzyme 22 (USP22) plays a direct role in regulating cell cycle, and its overexpression has been reported to be involved in tumor progression. However, little is known about the regulation of USP22 transcription. In this study, we cloned and characterized the human USP22 promoter. Using 5′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) analysis, the transcriptional initiation site was identified. Promoter deletion analysis showed that the sequence between -210 and -7 contains the basal promoter for USP22 in human fibroblast and tumor cells. Surprisingly, mutations in a putative Sp1 binding site immediately upstream of the USP22 transcriptional start site (-13 to -7) resulted in a significant induction of promoter activity. Further study revealed that Sp1 binds to this site in human normal fibroblast cells, and treatment with the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A led to a marked increase in USP22 transcript levels. Forced expression of exogenous Sp1 repressed the USP22 promoter activity in HeLa cells. In contrast, knockdown of Sp1 enhanced USP22 promoter activity and mRNA levels. These data suggest that Sp1 is a crucial regulator of USP22 transcription. © 2012 Xiong et al.

USP7 is a very important protein with an important role in regulating the p53 pathway, which is critical for genomic stability and tumor suppression. We here genotyped eight SNPs within the USP7 gene and conducted a case-control study in 312 CRC patients and 270 healthy subjects in the Chinese Han population. No significant associations were found for any single SNP and CRC risk. Our data eliminate USP7 as a potential candidate gene towards for CRC in the Han Chinese population.

84873713433	LIM and SH3 protein 1, a promoter of cell proliferation and migration, is a novel independent prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma	LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP-1) plays a significant role in the formation of several malignant tumours. However, the biological and clinical significances of LASP-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we analysed LASP-1 expression in 144 clinicopathologically characterised HCC cases. Using gene and transfection and RNA interference, we investigated the effects of LASP-1 overexpression and depletion on tumour cellular behaviour in vitro. LASP-1 expression was detected in not only cytoplasm and but also nucleus of HCC and liver cells. The positive rates of both cytosolic and nuclear LASP-1 expression in HCC were higher than adjacent non-tumourous tissues. Statistical analysis showed that heterogeneous LASP-1 expression is associated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of HCC patients. A significant trend was identified between cytosolic LASP-1 overexpression in HCC and worsening clinical prognosis. Multivariate survival analysis showed that cytosolic LASP-1 expression was recognised as an independent prognostic factor of patient's survival. In vitro study showed LASP-1 promoted cell proliferation and migration, and resulted in aggressive phenotypes of cancer cells. LASP-1 is a valuable marker of HCC progression. High cytosolic LASP-1 expression is associated with poor overall survival in HCC patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84874252008	Missense mutations of the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 gene cosegregate with mild paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia and infantile convulsions in a Chinese pedigree	Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is an autosomal dominant dystonia induced by sudden voluntary movements. Recently, proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) gene mutations, especially frameshift mutations, were described for PKD. In our study, we have collected a three-generation paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia-infantile convulsions pedigree in Tianjin, North China. The symptoms of six patients varied; age of onset decreased in each generation. Mutations in the PRRT2 gene in nine PKD family members were screened by PCR sequencing of genomic DNA samples. Missense mutations of the PRRT2 gene were found in all four PKD patients and two children with infantile convulsions. All six individuals carried heterozygous codon 138 (Pro/Ala) and codon 306 (Ala/Asp) mutations. Missense mutations of the PRRT2 gene other than truncate and frameshift mutations were account for PKD and/or infantile convulsions. Age of onset and symptoms were not necessarily associated with PRRT2 mutations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84874284862	MTOR Inhibition Ameliorates Cognitive and Affective Deficits Caused by Disc1 Knockdown in Adult-Born Dentate Granule Neurons	Abnormalities during brain development are thought to cause psychiatric illness and other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, developmental processes such as neurogenesis continue in restricted brain regions of adults, and disruptions of these processes could contribute to the phenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders. As previously reported, we show that . Disc1 knockdown specifically in adult-born dentate gyrus (DG) neurons results in increased mTOR signaling, hyperexcitability, and neuronal structure deficits. . Disc1 knockdown also resulted in pronounced cognitive and affective deficits, which could be reversed when the affected DG neurons were inactivated. Importantly, reversing increases in mTOR signaling with an FDA-approved inhibitor both prevented and treated these behavioral deficits, even when associated structural deficits were not reversed. Our findings suggest that a component of the affective and cognitive phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders may be caused by disruptions in adult-born neurons. Consequently, treatments directed at this cell population may have a significant impact on these phenotypes

84874313052	Protection of Chaishao Hewei Granule on autoimmune gastritis in rats	Objective: To investigate the protection and mechanism of Chaishao Hewei Granule (CHG) on autoimmune gastritis in rats. Methods: The model of autoimmune gastritis of rats was established by Freund's complete adjuvant. The rats were randomly divided into control, model, Sanjiu Weitai Granule (positive control), low-, mid-, and high-dose (0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 g/kg) CHG groups. After the day 28 of modeling, the rats were ig administered for continuous 28 d. The body weight of rats was measured at different time points of modeling. After the last administration, the contents of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in serum and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and maleic dialdehyde (MDA) in gastric homogenate were determined, and the changes of gastric histopathology were observed. Results: Compared with the model group, the low-, mid-, and high-dose CHG could decrease the contents of NO in rats by 20.53%, 63.95%, and 69.85%, respectively, increase the activities of GSH-Px in gastric homogenate by 16.11%, 16.11%, and 30.33%, respectively, and decrease the levels of MDA in gastric homogenate by 5.37%, 25.4%, and 34.69% obviously. CHG could make the level of IL-2 increase, more obviously in the high-dose CHG group, but there was no significant difference compared with the model group. Gastric mucosal histopathology showed desmoplasia and lymphoid nodules in mucosal lamina propria of rats in the model group; The muscularis mucosa was thicken, the smooth muscle fibers were disordered, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was severe. In CHG treatment groups in various doses, there were varying degrees of restoration and mitigation in inflammatory infiltration. Conclusion: CHG has protective action on gastric mucosal damage and the mechanism may be related to increasing the activity of anti-oxidase, scavenging free radicles, and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation.

84875300594	Syndecan Binding Protein (SDCBP) Is Overexpressed in Estrogen Receptor Negative Breast Cancers, and Is a Potential Promoter for Tumor Proliferation	Background: Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP), an adapter protein containing PDZ domains, contributes to the tumorigenicity and metastasis of many malignant tumors, such as malignant melanoma. Our study aimed in revealing the expression profile of SDCBP in breast cancer (BCa) and its role in tumor cell proliferation, and then exploring its value in the targeted treatment of BCa. Methodology/Principal Findings: We first evaluated the SDCBP expression by immunohistochemistry in normal breast and BCa tissues. Then we explored the expression profile of SDCBP in different BCa cell lines. By constructing SDCBP-silenced BCa cell clones, we further assessed the effects of SDCBP suppression on tumor cells in vitro by cell culture and in vivo by tumorigenicity. SDCBP expression was detected in 80.6% (n = 160) of BCa tissues, in contrast to its expression in 13% (n = 23) of normal breast tissues (P<0.001). Among the tumors, the level of its expression was positively correlated with histological grade and tumor staging while negatively correlated with the estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Higher expression of SDCBP was also noted in ER-negative BCa cell lines. It was also identified that SDCBP expression was down-regulated in a dose-dependent mode by 17-β estradiol in estrogen-responsive MCF-7. Furthermore, SDCBP silence inhibited ER-negative tumor cell growth in vivo and in vitro. Cell cycle studies showed that SDCBP silence increased G1 cell population and resulted in related cell-cycle-regulator changes: up-regulation of p21 and p27 while down-regulation of cyclin E. Conclusion/Significance: Our results suggested that SDCBP played an important role in tumor growth of ER-negative BCas. In these tumors where the estrogen signaling pathway is not available, SDCBP probably contribute to tumor growth through an alternative signaling pathway by promoting tumor cells passing the G1/S checkpoint into the cell cycle. Suppression of SDCBP expression may have its potential to become a targeted therapy for ER-negative BCas. © 2013 Qian et al.

84875853922	Authentication of official Da-huang by sequencing and multiplex allele-specific PCR of a short maturase K gene	Rhubarb (official Da-huang) is an important medicinal herb in Asia. Many adulterants of official Da-huang have been discovered in Chinese markets in recent years, which has resulted in adverse effects in medicinal treatment. Here, novel molecular markers based on a short maturase K (matK) gene were developed for authenticating official Da-huang. This study showed that all the species from official Da-huang were clustered together in one clade in the polygenetic trees based on short matK. Two highly conserved single nucleotide polymorphisms of short matK were mined in the species from official Da-huang. Based on these polymophisms, four improved specific primers of official Da-huang were successfully developed that generated reproducible specific bands. These results suggest that the short matK sequence can be considered as a favorable candidate for distinguishing official Da-huang from its adulterants. The established multiplex allele-specific PCR was determined to be simple and accurate and may serve as a preferable tool for authentication of official Da-huang. In addition, we suggest that short-sized specific bands be developed to authenticate materials used in traditional Chinese medicine. © 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.

Primary tumors may arise from any ectopic breast tissue. Accessory breast cancer occurring concurrently with primary invasive breast cancer is extremely rare. Two such cases were reported in this article. One was a 43-year-old Chinese female who exhibited bilateral breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified, IDC-NOS) and an accessory breast carcinoma (IDC-NOS) incidentally identified in her left axilla. The ectopic breast tissue in her right axilla presented with adenosis. The patient was surgically treated, followed by postoperative docetaxel epirubicin (TE) chemotherapy. The second case was a 53-year-old Chinese female with bilateral breast cancer (apocrine carcinoma) accompanied by an accessory breast carcinoma (IDC-NOS) in her right axilla that was also incidentally identified. The patient was surgically treated after three doses of cyclophosphamide epirubicin docetaxel (CET) neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy of the same regimen. © 2012 by Cancer Biology & Medicine.

84876144000	Expression and significance of Ll-CAM in invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast	Objective: The study aims to investigate the expression of Ll cell adhesion molecules (Ll-CAM) in invasion micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) and to analyze its clinical significance. Methods: Ll-CAM expression was analyzed in 97 IMPC cases and 95 invasive ductal carcinoma - not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS) cases via immunohistochemistry. The correlation of Ll-CAM expression with clinicopathologic characteristics, which include the prognosis IMPC patients, was determined. Results: The rate of Ll-CAM expression in IMPC (50.5%) is significantly higher than that of IDC-NOS (18.9%). Ll-CAM expression is also associated with histological grade, vessel invasion, lymph node metastasis, Ll-CAM vessels, and protein p53 expression (P,<0.05), whereas it is negatively associated with ER and PR (P<0.05). Ll-CAM was predominantly expressed in the cell-cell interface of the cell clusters of IMPC and in the stroma vascular endothelial cells. Univariate analysis results indicate that expression of Ll is a risk factor that can predict the survival of IMPC patients (P< 0.05). Multivariate analyses results from a Cox's proportional hazards model show that a high expression of Ll-CAM is an independent risk factor for the death of IMPC patients. Conclusion: This study suggests that Ll-CAM expression may have an important function in collective cell growth and is significantly associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Ll-CAM can be considered as biomarkers of prognosis and as a new target for IMPC therapy.

84878530833	Upregulation of myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL) after traumatic spinal cord injury in rats	Myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL) was identified as a tetraspan proteolipid that is highly expressed by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells as a component of compact myelin. It has also been reported to be a tumour suppressor and induces apoptosis through the Fas pathway. However, its expression and function in spinal cord injury are still unclear, especially in gray matter. In this study, we performed a spinal cord contusion injury (SCI) model in adult rats and detected the dynamic changes of MAL expression in spinal cord. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that MAL was present in gray and white matter of normal spinal cord. It gradually increased, got a peak at 1 day, and then declined to basal levels after spinal cord injury. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that MAL immunoreactivity was found in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, MAL expression was increased predominantly in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes. We also examined the expression profiles of active caspase-3, whose changes were correlated with the expression profiles of MAL. Moreover, co-localization of MAL with active caspase-3 was detected. In conclusion, this is the first description of MAL expression changes in gray matter after spinal cord injury. Our results prompted that MAL might participate in CNS pathophysiology after SCI. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The age of onset is an important phenotype of schizophrenia and may be under considerable genetic control. Our previous study showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs139887 in sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) gene was associated with the age of onset in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of another SNP rs139883 in the exon 4 of SOX10 on schizophrenia using an early-onset samples in the Han Chinese population. A total of 309 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 390 healthy controls were recruited for association study. No significant differences of allele or genotype frequencies were identified between the schizophrenic patients and controls. However, the C allele was significantly associated with an earlier age of onset in total patients and male patients (Kaplan-Meier log rank test P = 0.026; Kaplan-Meier log rank test P = 0.047, respectively), but not in females. In conclusion, the SOX10 rs139883 polymorphism influenced the age of onset of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner and this may represent a vital genetic clue for the etiology of schizophrenia. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84878778595	GTP Cyclohydrolase I and Tyrosine Hydroxylase Gene Mutations in Familial and Sporadic Dopa-Responsive Dystonia Patients	Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is a rare inherited dystonia that responds very well to levodopa treatment. Genetic mutations of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) are disease-causing mutations in DRD. To evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlations and diagnostic values of GCH1 and TH mutation screening in DRD patients, we carried out a combined study of familial and sporadic cases in Chinese Han subjects. We collected 23 subjects, 8 patients with DRD, 5 unaffected family members, and 10 sporadic cases. We used PCR to sequence all exons and splicing sites of the GCH1 and TH genes. Three novel heterozygous GCH1 mutations (Tyr75Cys, Ala98Val, and Ile135Thr) were identified in three DRD pedigrees. We failed to identify any GCH1 or TH mutation in two affected sisters. Three symptom-free male GCH1 mutation carriers were found in two DRD pedigrees. For those DRD siblings that shared the same GCH1 mutation, symptoms and age of onset varied. In 10 sporadic cases, only two heterozygous TH mutations (Ser19Cys and Gly397Arg) were found in two subjects with unknown pathogenicity. No GCH1 and TH mutation was found in 40 unrelated normal Han Chinese controls. GCH1 mutation is the main etiology of familial DRD. Three novel GCH1 mutations were identified in this study. Genetic heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance were quite common in DRD patients, especially in sporadic cases. Genetic screening may help establish the diagnosis of DRD; however, a negative GCH1 and TH mutation test would not exclude the diagnosis. © 2013 Cai et al.

84879466912	Intracardiac leiomyomatosis: A comprehensive analysis of 194 cases	Intracardiac leiomyomatosis is rare but has been increasingly reported in recent years. Owing to its rarity, intracardiac leiomyomatosis has been reported only as isolated case reports and case series. This disorder is thought to be underestimated and easily overlooked in the clinic, while it is dangerous owing to the risk of sudden death caused by total outflow tract obstruction. We performed an electronic literature search for intracardiac leiomyomatosis and identified 194 cases that were reported in English from 1974 (the first reported case) to September 2012. Our aim is to provide a detailed and comprehensive review of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, histopathological characterization, treatment and prognosis of this disorder. According to our analysis, intracardiac leiomyomatosis is most common in the fifth decade, and the mean age of detection is ∼50 years. Most patients had undergone previous hysterectomy/myomectomy or had a coexisting uterine leiomyoma when admitted. The most common clinical presentations were dyspnoea, syncope, oedema of the lower extremities and palpitation. Transoesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are helpful in the preoperative diagnosis and to guide the surgical management. Complete removal guarantees an excellent outcome, with no recurrence or postoperative death, while incomplete removal leads to recurrence in one-third of patients. Anti-oestrogen therapy is not imperative after incomplete removal owing to its inability to prevent recurrence. © 2013 The Author.

84882288816	MCM7 expression is altered in rat after spinal cord injury	Minichromosome maintenance protein 7 (MCM7), a member of the minichromosome maintenance protein family, is essential for eukaryotic DNA replication initiation and the early stage of the elongation process. MCM7 participates in the cell cycle control of genome duplication. While it is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, the biological function of MCM7 in the central nervous system is still with limited acquaintance. In the present study, we performed a spinal cord injury (SCI) model in adult rats. Western blotting indicated a marked alteration of MCM7 after SCI. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a wide distribution of MCM7 in the spinal cord. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that MCM7 immunoreactivity was increased predominantly in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia after SCI. We also examined the expression profiles of active caspase-3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and Ki67, whose changes were correlated with the expression profiles of MCM7. Moreover, colocalization of MCM7/active caspase-3 was detected in neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and colocalization of MCM7/PCNA was detected in NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and CD11b, respectively. Our results suggest that MCM7 might be implicated in the apoptosis of neuron and proliferation of astrocytes and microglia after SCI. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84881500331	Knockdown a Water Channel Protein, Aquaporin-4, Induced Glioblastoma Cell Apoptosis	Glioblastomas are the most aggressive forms of primary brain tumors due to their tendency to invade surrounding healthy brain tissues, rendering them largely incurable. The water channel protein, Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a key molecule for maintaining water and ion homeostasis in the central nervous system and has recently been reported with cell survival except for its well-known function in brain edema. An increased AQP4 expression has been demonstrated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), suggesting it is also involved in malignant brain tumors. In this study, we show that siRNA-mediated down regulation of AQP4 induced glioblastoma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We further show that several apoptotic key proteins, Cytochrome C, Bcl-2 and Bad are involved in AQP4 signaling pathways. Our results indicate that AQP4 may serve as an anti-apoptosis target for therapy of glioblastoma. © 2013 Ding et al.

84882663632	Accurate Quantification of microRNA via Single Strand Displacement Reaction on DNA Origami Motif	DNA origami is an emerging technology that assembles hundreds of staple strands and one single-strand DNA into certain nanopattern. It has been widely used in various fields including detection of biological molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in post-transcriptional gene repression as well as many other biological processes such as cell growth and differentiation. Alterations of miRNAs' expression contribute to many human diseases. However, it is still a challenge to quantitatively detect miRNAs by origami technology. In this study, we developed a novel approach based on streptavidin and quantum dots binding complex (STV-QDs) labeled single strand displacement reaction on DNA origami to quantitatively detect the concentration of miRNAs. We illustrated a linear relationship between the concentration of an exemplary miRNA as miRNA-133 and the STV-QDs hybridization efficiency; the results demonstrated that it is an accurate nano-scale miRNA quantifier motif. In addition, both symmetrical rectangular motif and asymmetrical China-map motif were tested. With significant linearity in both motifs, our experiments suggested that DNA Origami motif with arbitrary shape can be utilized in this method. Since this DNA origami-based method we developed owns the unique advantages of simple, time-and-material-saving, potentially multi-targets testing in one motif and relatively accurate for certain impurity samples as counted directly by atomic force microscopy rather than fluorescence signal detection, it may be widely used in quantification of miRNAs. © 2013 Zhu et al.

The mechanism of CMM processing is the key point of CMM research, which is also the key node of CMM modernization. Most mechanisms of CMM processing are unclear until now, which request the systematical and deep research. Raw and processed Rehmanniae Radix have the different pharmacological effects in clinical application, because there are lots of chemical reactions occurred during the steaming process. In the recent years, scientists all over the world have done lots of research on the changes and mechanisms of Rehmanniae Radix by steaming process under high temperature, and series of research achievements were obtained with the application of many new methods and technologies. These achievements provide not only many new ideas and methods for the mechanism exploration of CMM processing, but also the demonstration for researching and clarifying the mechanisms of CMM processing.

84885698295	Hyaluronic acid-coated bovine serum albumin nanoparticles loaded with brucine as selective nanovectors for intra-articular injection	Objective: To evaluate the potential of hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (BSANPs) as a novel chondrocyte-targeting drug-delivery nanomedicine. Methods: The HA-BSANPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. Fluorescence imaging was used to visualize the distribution of nanoparticles after intra-articular injection. The chondrocyte-targeting efficiency and cellular uptake mechanism of HA-BSANPs were investigated using endocytic inhibitors. Results: HA-BSANPs were successfully prepared with HA coating the surface and amorphous drug in the core. Compared with BSANPs, HA-BSANPs exhibited improved uptake by chondrocytes through a receptor-mediated active uptake mechanism. The endocytosis process of BSANPs and HA-BSANPs involved clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. No apparent thickening or hyperplasia of the synovium was observed in either BSANPs or HA-BSANPs. The HA-BSANPs could reside in the articular cavity of rats for more than 14 days, which was significantly longer than BSANPs. Conclusion: HA-BSANPs are a promising carrier for articular-related diseases due to elongated articular residence and improved chondrocytic accumulation. © 2013 Chen et al.

84887106609	Association study on the DLG4 gene and schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population	BACKGROUND: Abnormal expressions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and its interacting postsynaptic density (PSD) molecules have been hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Few studies have carried out association studies with DLG4 gene (coding PSD-95 protein) and sought to validate the results with Asian schizophrenia patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To further investigate the significance of DLG4 in Asian schizophrenic patients, we examined seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene in 1504 unrelated Chinese mainland individuals (893 patients and 611 controls). RESULTS: No association was found between these seven SNPs and schizophrenia within our sample. No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between schizophrenic paranoid patients and controls were found. CONCLUSION: Although no allelic or genotypic variances of this gene were observed, the possibility that SNPs within DLG4 represent a positive schizophrenia risk gene cannot be excluded. Our research provided a reference for further research into this gene in other populations. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84887109570	Loss of RhoGDI is a novel independent prognostic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma	RhoGDI (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor alpha or RhoGDIa) has been identified as a regulator of Rho GTPases, which are essential for tumor progression, but its role in cancer remains controversial and little is known in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed RhoGDI expression in 147 clinicopathologically characterized HCC cases. RhoGDI expression was detected in cytoplasm of HCC tissues. Statistical analysis showed that there was no relationship between RhoGDI expression and clinicopathological features. Importantly, a significant trend was identified between loss of RhoGDI expression in HCC and worsening clinical prognosis. Multivariate survival analysis showed that negative RhoGDI expression was recognized as an independent prognostic factor of patient's survival. Our results suggest that RhoGDI protein is a valuable marker of prognosis for patients with HCC.

84888098133	A novel splicing site mutation of the GPR143 gene in a Chinese X-linked ocular albinism pedigree	Ocular albinism is an X-linked inherited disease characterized by hypopigmentation of the iris and nystagmus. To identify a new disease-causing mutation of ocular albinism, we collected a Han Chinese pedigree with 7 male congenital nystagmus patients over 3 generations. Slit-lamp photography and optical coherence tomography were performed for the proband. Genomic DNA was extracted from a whole blood sample from the proband using the high-salt method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing was carried out for GPR143 and FRMD7 genes. The three-dimensional structures of the wild-type and mutant GPR143 proteins were determined using SWISS-MODEL. The transmission of the disease in the pedigree clearly followed an X-linked pattern. The proband had significant iris and fundus hypopigmentation. Optical coherence tomography showed severe foveal hypoplasias in both eyes of the proband. A novel splicing site (G/C) mutation was found on the boundary of the 6th intron and the 7th exon of the GPR143 gene, resulting in a 9-amino-acid deletion (codons 257-265) in the 6th transmembrane domain of the GPR143 protein. In conclusion, a novel splicing site mutation of the GPR143 gene was found in a Han Chinese congenital ocular albinism pedigree. © FUNPEC-RP.

84890015119	A simple Spatial Working Memory and Attention Test on Paired Symbols shows developmental deficits in schizophrenia patients	People with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia often display deficits in spatial working memory and attention. Evaluating working memory and attention in schizophrenia patients is usually based on traditional tasks and the interviewer's judgment. We developed a simple Spatial Working Memory and Attention Test on Paired Symbols (SWAPS). It takes only several minutes to complete, comprising 101 trials for each subject. In this study, we tested 72 schizophrenia patients and 188 healthy volunteers in China. In a healthy control group with ages ranging from 12 to 60, the efficiency score (accuracy divided by reaction time) reached a peak in the 20-27 age range and then declined with increasing age. Importantly, schizophrenia patients failed to display this developmental trend in the same age range and adults had significant deficits compared to the control group. Our data suggests that this simple Spatial Working Memory and Attention Test on Paired Symbols can be a useful tool for studies of spatial working memory and attention in neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2013 Wei Song et al.

84892462247	FBW7 upregulation enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells	Lung cancer is extremely harmful to human health and has one of the highest worldwide incidences of all malignant tumors. Approximately 80% of lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Cisplatin-based multidrug chemotherapy regimen is standard for such lesions, but drug resistance is an increasing problem. F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBW7) is a member of the F-box protein family that regulates cell cycle progression, and cell growth and differentiation. FBW7 also functions as a tumor suppressor. Methods: We used cell viability assays, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence combined with siRNA interference or plasmid transfection to investigate the underlying mechanism of cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells. Results: We found that FBW7 upregulation significantly increased cisplatin chemosensitivity and that cells expressing low levels of FBW7, such as NCI-H1299 cells, have a mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing or plasmid-mediated upregulation of FBW7 resulted in altered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) patterns in NSCLC cells. These data support a role for FBW7 in regulating the EMT in NSCLC cells. Conclusion: FBW7 is a potential drug target for combating drug resistance and regulating the EMT in NSCLC cells.

84892610332	Insulin protects apoptotic cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury through the sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate axis	Objective: Experimental and clinical studies have shown that administration of insulin during reperfusion is cardioprotective, but the mechanisms underlying this effect are still unknown. In this study, the ability of insulin to protect apoptotic cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury using the sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate axis was investigated. Methods and Results: Rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation. [c-32P] ATP was used to assess sphingosine kinase activity. Insulin was found to increase sphingosine kinase activity. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis showed changes in the subcellular location of sphingosine kinase 1 from cytosol to the membrane in cardiomyocytes. Insulin caused cardiomyocytes to accumulate of S1P in a dose-dependent manner. FRET efficiency showed that insulin also transactivates the S1P1 receptor. TUNEL staining showed that administration of insulin during reoxygenation could to reduce the rate of reoxygenation-induced apoptosis, which is a requirement for SphK 1 activity. It also reduced the rate of activation of the S1P receptor and inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death in cardiomyocytes. Conclusion: The sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine 1-phosphate/S1P receptor axis is one pathway through which insulin protects rat cardiomyocytes from apoptosis induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. 2013 Yu et al.

84892820960	Overexpression of RhoGDI, a novel predictor of distant metastasis, promotes cell proliferation and migration in hepatocellular carcinoma	RhoGDI (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor alpha, or RhoGDIα) was identified as a regulator of Rho GTPases, but its role in cancer remains controversial. In this study, increased expression of RhoGDI was detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and tissues with highly metastatic potential. RhoGDI overexpression correlated with postoperative distant metastasis. Enforced expression of RhoGDI in HCC cells significantly enhanced cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, knockdown of RhoGDI caused an inhibition of the aggressive phenotypes of HCC cells. Furthermore, RhoGDI up-regulated Rho, but not Rac, and enhanced PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway activity. Our findings suggest that RhoGDI overexpression is a predictor of distant metastasis and plays an important role in the progression of HCC.

84893680724	Protection against lung cancer patient plasma-induced lymphocyte suppression by ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides	Background/Aims: This study was conducted to determine the potential of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (Gl-PS) in protection against lung cancer patient plasma-induced suppression of lymphocytes. Lung cancer is a major cause of disease and loss of life in the United States and worldwide. Cancer cells release immunosuppressive mediators, such as PGE2, TGF-β, IL-10, and VEGF, to inhibit the immune response to escape from immune surveillance. Gl-PS has been shown to counteract this immune inhibition in an animal cell culture model, and thus to facilitate tumor control. The present study explored whether or not such an effect could also be demonstrated in human lung cancer patients. Methods: Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, MTT, immunocytochemistry, and western blot analysis were used to assess lymphocyte activation with PHA. Results: The plasma of lung cancer patients suppressed proliferation, CD69 expression, and perforin and granzyme B production in lymphocytes upon activation by PHA, effects that were partially of fully reversed by Gl-PS. Conclusion: Lung cancer patient plasma-induced suppression of lymphocyte activation by phytohemagglutinin may be antagonized fully or partially by Gl-PS, an observation suggesting the potential of Gl-PS in cancer therapy.

84894107556	Recurrent deletions of ULK4 in schizophrenia: A gene crucial for neuritogenesis and neuronal motility	Although many pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) are associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, few of them have been functionally characterised. Here we report multiple schizophrenia cases with CNVabnormalities specific to unc-51-like kinase 4 (ULK4), a serine/threonine kinase gene. Deletions spanning exons 21-34 of ULK4 were present in 4 out of 3391 schizophrenia patients from the International Schizophrenia Consortium, but absent in 3181 controls. Deletions removing exons 33 and 34 of the large splice variant of ULK4 also were enriched in Icelandic schizophrenia and bipolar patients compared with 98,022 controls (P50.0007 for schizophrenia plus bipolar disorder). Combining the two cohorts gives a P-value less than 0.0001 for schizophrenia, or for schizophrenia plus bipolar disorder. The expression of ULK4 is neuron-specific and developmentally regulated. ULK4 modulates multiple signalling pathways that include ERK, p38, PKC and JNK, which are involved in stress responses and implicated in schizophrenia. Knockdown of ULK4 disrupts the composition of microtubules and compromises neuritogenesis and cell motility. Targeted Ulk4 deletion causes corpus callosum agenesis in mice. Our findings indicate that ULK4 is a rare susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. © 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

84896547730	Preparation and characterization of galactosylated glycol chitosan micelles and its potential use for hepatoma-targeting delivery of doxorubicin	This study aimed to develop novel galactosylated cholesterol modified-glycol chitosan (Gal-CHGC) micelles for targeting delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) in live cancer cells. Three kinds of Gal-CHGC conjugates were synthesized and characterized. The mean particle size and critical aggregation concentration of these polymeric micelles increased with the increase of galactose substitution degree. The DOX-loaded micelles were prepared by an o/w method. The mean diameters of DOX-loaded galactosylated micelles were in the range of 387-497 nm. DOX released from drug-loaded micelles displayed a biphasic way. Cellular uptake studies demonstrated that DOX-loaded galactosylated micelles could enhance the uptake of DOX into HepG2 cells. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded galactosylated micelles against HepG2 cells significantly improved in contrast with free DOX and DOX-loaded micelles without galactosylation. These results suggested that Gal-CHGC micelles could be a potential carrier for hepatoma-targeting drug delivery. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84896552863	Spatiotemporal Profile and Essential Role of RBM3 Expression after Spinal Cord Injury in Adult Rats	Hypoxia and other adverse conditions are usually encountered by rapidly growing cells. The RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) is induced by low temperature and hypoxia. However, its expression and function in spinal cord injury are still unclear. To investigate the certain expression and biological function in the central nervous system, we performed an acute spinal cord contusion injury (SCI) model in adult rats. Western blot analysis indicated a striking expression upregulation of RBM3 after spinal cord injury (SCI). Double immunofluorescence staining prompted that RBM3 immunoreactivity was found in astrocytes and neurons. Interestingly, RBM3 expression was increased predominantly in astrocytes. Furthermore, colocalization of RBM3 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected in astrocytes. To further understand whether RBM3 plays a role in astrocyte proliferation, we applied lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce astrocyte proliferation in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated that RBM3 expression was positively correlated with PCNA expression following LPS stimulation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the expression of RBM3 was also changed following the stimulation of astrocytes with LPS, which was parallel with the data in vivo. Additionally, knocking RBM3 down with small interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that RBM3 might play a significant role in the proliferation of astrocytes treated by hypoxia in vitro. These results suggest that RBM3 may be involved in the proliferation of astrocytes after SCI. To summarize, we firstly uncover the temporal and spatial expression changes of RBM3 in spinal cord injury. Our data suggest that RBM3 might be implicated in central nervous system pathophysiology after SCI. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84896715158	Concerted suppression of STAT3 and GSK3β is involved in growth inhibition of non-small cell lung cancer by xanthatin	Xanthatin, a sesquiterpene lactone purified from Xanthium strumarium L., possesses prominent anticancer activity. We found that disruption of GSK3β activity was essential for xanthatin to exert its anticancer properties in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), concurrent with preferable suppression of constitutive activation of STAT3. Interestingly, inactivation of the two signals are two mutually exclusive events in xanthatin-induced cell death. Moreover, we surprisingly found that exposure of xanthatin failed to trigger the presumable side effect of canonical Wnt/β-Catenin followed by GSK3β inactivation. We further observed that the downregulation of STAT3 was required for xanthatin to fine-tune the risk. Thus, the discovery of xanthatin, which has ability to simultaneously orchestrate two independent signaling cascades, may have important implications for screening promising drugs in cancer therapies. © 2013 Tao et al.

84896321396	Prediction of early response to chemotherapy in lung cancer by using diffusion-weighted MR imaging	Purpose. To determine whether change of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value could predict early response to chemotherapy in lung cancer. Materials and Methods. Twenty-five patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer underwent chest MR imaging including DWI before and at the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy. The tumor's mean ADC value and diameters on MR images were calculated and compared. The grouping reference was based on serial CT scans according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Logistic regression was applied to assess treatment response prediction ability of ADC value and diameters. Results. The change of ADC value in partial response group was higher than that in stable disease group (P = 0.004). ROC curve showed that ADC value could predict treatment response with 100% sensitivity, 64.71% specificity, 57.14% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value, and 82.7% accuracy. The area under the curve for combination of ADC value and longest diameter change was higher than any parameter alone (P ≤ 0.01). Conclusions. The change of ADC value may be a sensitive indicator to predict early response to chemotherapy in lung cancer. Prediction ability could be improved by combining the change of ADC value and longest diameter. © 2014 Jing Yu et al.

84897468655	Osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation stimulating activities of the main components of Fructus Psoraleae corylifoliae	Osteoporosis is a disease of bones that leads to an increased risk of fracture. Fructus of Psoralea corylifolia L. (scurfpea fruit) is commonly utilized for treating bone fractures and joint diseases for thousands of years in China. This study was aimed to screen active principles, which might have the potency to stimulate osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation from scurfpea fruit. A HPLC method was established to analyze the main components in scurfpea fruit. Totally 11 compounds have been identified by comparing their retention time with correspondent standard substances. The MTT and ALP methods were utilized for the assay of osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation activity. Icariin, a prenylated flavonoid glycoside was treated as the positive control. Bavachin and isobavachin significantly stimulated cell proliferation, while bakuchiol exhibited stronger effect to enhance osteoblasts differentiation. All these compounds were found with a characterized structure that in each of their molecule backbones, a prenylated side chain was attached. These results lead to a hypothesis that prenyl group might be crucial to exhibit the activity. The structure-effect relationship of these compounds with prenyl group in mouse primary calvarial osteoblasts needs to be explored in further research. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

84898056842	The α-gliadin genes from Brachypodium distachyon L. Provide evidence for a significant gap in the current genome assembly	Brachypodium distachyon, is a new model plant for most cereal crops while gliadin is a class of wheat storage proteins related with wheat quality attributes. In the published B. distachyon genome sequence databases, no gliadin gene is found. In the current study, a number of gliadin genes in B. distachyon were isolated, which is contradictory to the results of genome sequencing projects. In our study, the B. distachyon seeds were found to have no gliadin protein expression by gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and Western blotting analysis. However, Southern blotting revealed a presence of more than ten copies of α-gliadin coding genes in B. distachyon. By means of AS-PCR amplification, four novel full-ORF α-gliadin genes, and 26 pseudogenes with at least one stop codon as well as their promoter regions were cloned and sequenced from different Brachypodium accessions. Sequence analysis revealed a few of single-nucleotide polymorphisms among these genes. Most pseudogenes were resulted from a C to T change, leading to the generation of TAG or TAA in-frame stop codon. To compare both the full-ORFs and the pseudogenes among Triticum and Triticum-related species, their structural characteristics were analyzed. Based on the four T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes and two ployglutamine domains, Aegilops, Triticum, and Brachypodium species were found to be more closely related. The phylogenetic analysis further revealed that B. distachyon was more closely related to Aegilops tauschii, Aegilops umbellulata, and the A or D genome of Triticum aestivum.

84898544416	Tear-drop fracture of the axis in a child with an 8-year follow-up: A case report	We reported a 12-year-old boy with neck pain and dysphagia 6 days after his neck being tied by another boy's arms from the back. The boy was found to have a tear-drop fracture of the axis in both radiograph and MRI, which was a rare case in children. He was placed in a cervical traction with Glisson belt and received transfusion for 2 weeks until his neck pain and dysphagia were released. Thereafter, an operation of anterior fusion and fixation was chosen to ensure further stability of the cervical spine and replacement of the fracture fragment. An 8-year follow-up examination showed a satisfactory range of motion of the cervical spine, fusion at C2-3 intervertebral space, and normal signal of C3-4 intervertebral disk. We conclude that tear-drop fractures of the axis in children may be caused by extension injury without a high-energy trauma, and operation of anterior fusion and fixation can be the treatment of choice. © Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

84903749667	Genotypic diversity of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of Chinese dwarf cherry (Cerasus humilis (Bge.) Sok.) in China	Nutritional properties, phenolic compound contents, and antioxidant activity of Chinese dwarf cherry (Cerasus humilis (Bge.) Sok.) were investigated in 13 genotypes from Changping District of Beijing (CPBJ). In addition, four common genotypes grown in Shangyi County of Hebei Province (SYHB) were also studied to illustrate the plasticity of a given genotype in response to growth locations. A large genotypic diversity was observed in most of the assessed quality parameters and these quality parameters were also significantly affected by growth locations. Ascorbic acid value varied from 16.3 to 83.2mg 100g

84905221050	No association of SLC6A3 and SLC6A4 gene polymorphisms with schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population	The SLC6A3 and SLC6A4 genes are members of a class of neurotransmitter transporters for the release, re-uptake and recycling of neurotransmitters in synapses. SLC6A3 and SLC6A4 encode a dopamine transporter and serotonin transporter, respectively. Abnormal expression and genetic polymorphism of SLC6A3 and SLC6A4 genes may increase the risk of developing mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and aggressive behavior in Alzheimer disease, etc. Nevertheless, association between SLC6A3, SLC6A4 genes polymorphism and schizophrenia patients have not been well studied in Han Chinese people. In this study, we examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC6A3, SLC6A4 were associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese people (893 schizophrenia patients and 611 healthy controls). No significant difference in allelic or genotypic frequency was found between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. No positive linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected either. No haplotypic distributions were positive. Accordingly, our study suggests that the 10 SNPs within both genes we examined do not play a major role in schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84908666989	Mineral element composition of 27 chinese dwarf cherry (Cerasus humilis (Bge.) Sok.) genotypes collected in China	Concentrations of ten mineral elements (P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb, and Sr) were determined in 27 genotypes of Chinese dwarf cherry using total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The results indicated that Chinese dwarf cherry was a rich source of mineral elements, especially Ca, Fe, and Zn, with the highest concentrations being 524, 24.2, and 4.86 mg kg 1 FW in genotypes C-12-5-7, A-9-1-3, and E-20-2-2, respectively. Among the 27 Chinese dwarf cherry genotypes examined, the coefficients of variation were > 30% for Rb, Fe, Ca, Sr, Zn, Mn concentrations, and 25 - 30% for P, S, K, and Cu concentrations. Principal components analysis was applied to the data matrix to evaluate the analytical results. Three principal components (PC1 - PC3) accounted for 75.6% of the total variance. The 27 Chinese dwarf cherry genotypes studied have potential benefits for human nutrition and healthcare research, as well as for genetic biodiversity research.
