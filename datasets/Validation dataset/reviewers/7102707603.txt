8844244649	Mass balance of a circulating fluidized bed and physical phenomena encountered in the Latter's operation	Mass balance in a fluidized bed constitutes the core and basis of the combustion process in a circulating fluidized bed and is of utmost importance to the operation of the fluidized bed. A mass balance model is presented for a circulating fluidized bed in its steady state along with a discussion of various factors liable to influence the mass balance. The mass balance model was used to calculate the circulating mass flow rate, residue mass flow rate and fly ash flow rate (including its particle distribution) of a 75 t/h circulating fluidized bed boiler. An analysis was conducted of the intrinsic causes of the physical phenomena and problems encountered in the operation of the fluidized bed boiler under the influence of the mass balance. Such phenomena include bed quality and the characteristics of the separator used for the circulating bed, etc. Some existing problems currently attracting the attention of a circle of theoretical and industrial workers are quantitatively explained.

1642587251	Unburned carbon loss in fly ash of CFB boilers burning hard coal	The unburned carbon loss in fly ash of circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers, most of which are burning active fuels such as lignite or peat, is very low. Most CFB boilers in China burn hard coal such as anthracite and coal waste, so the carbon content in the fly ash from these boilers is higher than expected. The source of unburned carbon in the fly ash was studied by a series of field tests and laboratory investigations. The char behavior during combustion, including fragmentation and deactivation, which is related to the parent coal, has an important impact on the carbon burnout. The research shows that the char deactivation occurs during char burnout in fluidized bed combustion, especially for large particles of low rank coal. The uneven mixing of solid and air in the core region of the furnace also causes poor burnout of carbon in the fly ash. An index describing the volatile content (as dry ash free basis) over the heating value was proposed to present the coal rank. The coal combustion efficiency was shown to be strongly related with this coal index. Several changes in the CFB boiler design are suggested to reduce the unburned carbon loss in the fly ash.

17244368377	Investigation of carbon content in fly ash for a BP neural network-based pulverized coal-fired boiler	Carbon content in fly ash is a major index, which reflects the combustion efficiency of a pulverized coal-fired utility boiler. On the basis of a BP (inverse propagation of error) neural network method set up was a 11-23-1 type BP neural network model. In accordance with the specific features of a four-corner tangentially fired pulverized- coal utility boiler 11 parameters which can influence combustion have been selected to serve as input factors of the neural network. The parameters include: pulverized coal fineness, burner tilting angle, oxygen content in flue gas, parameters of 5 ranks of coal, operation combination of burner spray nozzles, etc. A training course was conducted for the established model and model parameters were obtained. The error predicted by using the model is less than 6% when compared with actual values. On this basis the authors have also proposed a simplified method for analyzing the carbon content in fly ash, which may be affected by a single parameter. This makes it possible to attain under certain conditions a concise and intuitive reflection of multi-dimensional non-linear law contained in the network. The results of the calculation and analysis indicate that the model- based method can effectively identify the mechanism of various parameters in influencing the carbon content in fly ash and may be employed to conduct the analysis, prediction and optimized regulation of carbon content in boiler fly ash.

19644384767	Transition of the catalytic capability of minerals for the oxidation of coal-char during heat treatment	The effect of heat treatment on the catalytic capability of minerals for the oxidation of coal-char prepared from the vitrinite of YX coal and JJ coal was investigated using XRD and TGA. The effect of heat treatment on the carbon structure and the catalytic capability of minerals in coal-char are weak under low heat treatment temperature. With the increase of heat treatment temperature, the catalytic capability of minerals decreases and vanishes at last when the temperature is high enough; meanwhile, the crystalline of coal-char grows. Thus, the reactivity of coal-char decreases. The distribution and existence form of minerals in different coal are different as well as the catalytic capability of minerals. The decrease of the catalytic capability of minerals and the growth of the crystalline in coal-char caused by heat treatment are the main reasons for the deactivation of coal-char during combustion.

Several years of operational practice show that the boiler' s performance is good, with a maximal continuous operating time of over 5000 h. The boilers' outstanding superiority lies in its high reliability and its fuel flexibility. Its combustion efficiency is quite satisfactory, with emission of pollutants meeting local standard requirements.

20444424630	Analysis of mass balance in a circulating fluidized bed boiler	The mass balance in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) represents the essence and foundation of its combustion process, which affects CFB combustion and desulfurization efficiency, and also determines the thermal load distribution in a furnace. The mass balance system of 'one inlet and two outlets' of a CFB constitutes the latter's core concept and is also a key to understanding the mass balance system of the CFB. The authors have presented and analyzed some issues concerning the mass balance of a circulating fluidized bed, such as stationary state design of the CFB, bed material quality and mass balance model, etc. The operation of a CFB requires high 'bed material quality' and relatively high mass circulating rate. In addition, the separation efficiency curve of its separator is also required to have a clear 100% separation particle diameter of critical size. The mass balance in a CFB is affected not only by the separator efficiency, but also by such factors as ash formation and wear characteristics of the coal being fed, the segregation of particles in bed, ash removal mode and efficiency, etc.

19044373586	Effect of swirl number on the number of particle impacts near a swirl burner outlet	The effect of the secondary air swirl number on the number of particle impacts which affects slagging was studied to reduce slagging in utility boilers. The flow field was measured using PDA to validate the numerical simulations. The simulations agree well with the experimental data near the burner outlet. The flow field near a single burner outlet was then analyzed for various inner secondary air swirling numbers with the stochastic separated flow model as a postprocessor to calculate the particle impacts. The computation results indicate that total number of particle impacts is relatively small and that the number of impacts is inversely proportional to the swirl number.

The combustion of seven different types of coal were measured in a laboratory scale fluidized bed with under-bed preheat system. The study analyzed the effects of particle size, furnace temperature, volatiles content and moisture content on the ignition temperature, TiF. TiF in the fluidized beds were measured at standard operating conditions. Comparison of the ignition temperatures and the feed temperatures in real CFB boilers shows that the TiF measured in fluidized beds can be used as a reference for the coal feeding process. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

22244493531	Design theory of circulating fluidized bed boilers	Studies on circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers have being conducted at the Tsinghua University (TH) for about two decades and much of works are done to link the fundamentals with practical application. A full set of design theory was developed and some key elements of this theory are presented in this paper. First, a classification of state of the solid-gas two-phase flow in CFB boiler is given. TH's studies validated that a CFB boiler can be generally described as the superposition of a fast bed in the upper part with a bubbling bed or turbulent bed in the bottom part. A concept model of material balance for the open system of CFB boiler was developed and later improved as a more comprehensive 1-D model taking ash formation, particle attrition and segregation in bed into account. Some results of the models are discussed. Then the concept of State Specification of a CFB boiler is defined and discussed. The State Specification is regarded as the first step to design a CFB and a base to classify different style of CFB boiler technologies for various CFB boiler manufacturers. The State Specification adopted by major CFB boiler makers is summarized and associated importance issues are addressed. The heat transfer model originally developed by Leckner and his coworkers is adopted and improved. It is further calibrated with experimental data obtained on the commercial CFB boiler measurements. The principle, improvements and application of the model are introduced. Some special tools developed for heat transfer field test are also given. Also, combustion behaviors of char and volatile content are studied, and the combustion difference between a CFB boiler and a bubbling bed is analyzed. The influence of volatile content and size distribution is discussed. The concept of vertical distribution of combustion and heat in CFB boiler furnace is introduced and discussed as well. In the last, the suggested design theory of CFB boiler is summarized. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.

The standard of operating condition for measuring coal ignition temperature in fluidized bed was provided.

Three different flow patterns (separated jets, flow transition, and jet coalescence), with the two jets always coalesce within the penetration depth, were first observed in the jetting fluidized bed. Radial profiles in the fluidized bed were measured with a PC-4 optical fiber probe. Effects of jet gas velocity and nozzle distance on the radial and axial voidage distribution were studied. The bed hydrodynamic behavior was characterized using a deterministic chaotic theory to analyze effects of jet gas velocity, static bed height, and nozzle distance on the correlation dimension, which increased with increasing jet gas velocity and static bed height.

And the catalytic mechanism is also discussed. The experimental results show that CaO catalyzes the cracking reactions of benzene and toluene and the paths are changed. The cracking active energy of benzene and toluene can be declined to 28.66% and 47.87% over CaO compared with that over quartz, and the frequency factor is decreased by three and six orders of magnitude respectively.

The mass flow which is in and out of fluidized bed system has been taken into consideration as possible, so as to increase the generalization of the model. The coupling relationships between pressure drop of CFB and air feed rate, and the dynamic interactions between CFB operation parameters and manipulating variables as well as component characteristics were established. All the above points make the model be versatile and close to real life. The model was partially verified by experimental data from a Chinese domestic 75 t/h CFBC boiler with square shape cyclone.

0032309154	New achievements of development of CFBC boilers in China	Coal is the main energy source of China. The property and quality of coals of different regions of China may differ from each other greatly. In some region, coal of high ash content and high sulfur content has to be used for some cogeneration power plants. To reduce the sulfur dioxide emission, and to utilize the ashes from coal, CFBC boilers are preferred. However, CFBC boilers with bulky cyclone separators are too expensive for those smaller power plants to afford. Therefore, CFBC boilers with Chinese features, without the bulky cyclone separators, are developed by different institutions. Recently the progress of the development of these boilers is very optimistic. The new achievements of different designs are introduced below.

One of the key technology of coal gasification is to reduce the yield of tar and to increase the yield of gas. The reactions of the two main components: benzene and toluene over circulating ash of CFBB burning mixed coal in a fixed bed reactor are experimentally investigated. Cracking reactions active energy is measured. The catalytic mechanic is also discussed. The experimental results show that circulating ash promotes the cracking reactions of tar. The total yield of gas cracking products increases.

0032268073	Catalytic cracking reactions of tar components over circulating ash of CFBB	To decrease the yield of tar is one of the key problems for the partial coal gasification with the circulating fluidized bed technology which was suggested by Tsinghua University.

An experimental investigation of the catalytic cracking reactions of the two main components of tar, benzene and toluene, over circulating ash of CFBB in a fixed bed reactor was introduced. The cracking reactions kinetic parameters were measured and the catalytic mechanism was also discussed. The experimental results prove that the circulating ash has catalytic effects on the cracking reactions of tar, and it causes the total yield of gas cracking products to increase.

Local solid suspension densities along the height and the depth of the furnace were measured respectively.

The test includes fractional collection efficiency, solid carryover, solid circulating rate, etc. The test result proves that the collection efficiency of the water cooled separator is almost the same as that of the round cyclone with the same equivalent diameter, while its pressure drop is much lower than that of conventional cyclones. The measured solid circulating rate matches the design parameter, which satisfies the need of heat transfer and combustion. The collected hot test results are valuable for scaling up design.

23344449145	Research on carbon content in fly ash from circulating fluidized bed boilers	The carbon content in the fly ash from most Chinese circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers is much higher than expected, which directly influences the combustion efficiency. In the present paper, carbon burnout was investigated in both field tests and laboratory experiments. The effect of coal property, operation condition, gas-solid mixing, char deactivation, residence time, and cyclone performance are analyzed seriatim based on a large amount of experimental results. A coal index is proposed to describe the coal rank, having a strong effect on the char burnout. Bad gas-solid mixing in the furnace is another important reason of the higher carbon content in the fly ash. Some chars in the fly ash are deactivated during combustion of large coal particles and have very low carbon reactivity. Several suggestions are made about design, operation, and modification to reduce the carbon content in the fly ash. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

27544435329	Impact of medium-level temperature pyrolysis on semicoke combustion reactivity	By employing the method of thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffraction measured respectively were the combustion reactivity and structural changes of the semicoke of two low-rank bituminous coals and one type of anthracite during the process of pyrolysis at 400~1400 °C. The cause of the variation in reactivity of the low-rank coals was also discussed. A study has revealed that the lowering of semicoke reactivity is mainly due to the semicoke crystal-lattice growth and the gradual disappearance of catalytic action of minerals during the pyrolysis process. At a temperature lower than 900°C during the further pyrolysis of the semicoke formed by raw coal being deprived of a majority of volatile matter the crystal-lattice growth phenomenon is not very significant. However, there emerged a marked reduction of reactivity, which is mainly related to the loss of activity of minerals in coal during the pyrolysis process.

27744493249	Measurement of heat transfer in a 465t/h circulating fluidized bed boiler	The study of heat transfer and thermal boundary layer in the combustor of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) is important to the boiler design and operation. Both heat transfer coefficient between the solid-gas flow and the water-wall and the thickness of thermal boundary layer are key data to determine the amount and layout of the tube walls in a CFB furnace. A series of experiments was conducted on a 465t/h commercial CFB boiler, which operated at bed temperature between 850 and 900°C, and at superficial gas velocity between 5.2 to 5.9m/s. Local bed to water wall heat transfer coefficients and temperature profiles near the wall were measured at a set of test ports at different heights of the sidewall. In the same time, the local solid bulk density near the wall was also measured. Special tools such as heat flux probe, solid bulk density sampling probe and temperature probe were developed for the experiments and their structures were introduced. The experimental results were compared with the data from previous studies. Theoretical analysis of the factors that play important role in heat transfer in a CFB boiler was also performed. The relationship between heat transfer and thermal boundary layer was also discussed. Furthermore, a simple model correlating the local heat transfer coefficients with bulk density was developed.

27744532943	Effect of heat treatment on the reactivity and crystallinity of coal-char	The effect of heat treatment on the reactivity and crystallinity of char prepared from the vitrinite of two coals (YX, JJ) was investigated by using XRD and TGA in this paper. The results from TGA show that the reactivity of the chars from YXV and JJV decreases with the increase of heat treatment temperature. The reactivity of YXV char decreases quickly and significantly as heat treatment time increases. However, after heat treatment time of 60 min, it decreases slowly. The effect of heat treatment time on the reactivity of JJV char is small. The results from XRD show that the crystallinity of coal-char is determined by the intensity of heat treatment. When heat treatment time is more than 60 minutes, the turbostratic crystallite of YXV char prepared under 900°C changes remarkably and becomes more orderly. The aromatic layer stacking heights (Lc) of YXV Char when heat treated above 900°C increased with the increase of heat treatment time. The effect of heat treat time on Lc of JJV char is small, but under heat treatment temperature of 1200°C, the crystalline of JJV char grows distinctly. There is a good parallel relationship between the crystalline growth and deactivation of the chars. It can be concluded that the growth of the crystalline is the main reason for the deactivation of coal-char. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.

So far, the experience and performance evaluation of the boilers with such large capacity are very limited.

27744577937	Combustion modeling of CFB boiler furnace based on an Euler-Euler approach	For the better design of large scale CFB boilers, reliable multi-dimensional modeling which can be used to predict the heterogeneous distributions of gas and solid concentration as well as temperature in the furnace is necessary and demanded. A model describing the complex combustion process in a CFB boiler furnace has been developed. The model consists of several essential sub-parts: the hydrodynamics of the bed, combustion of fuel, and overall mass balance of the furnace. In the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study on hydrodynamics in a CFB boiler, the Euler-Euler approach is used, in which both gas and solid phases are considered as interpenetrating continua with the interaction through drag and energy dissipation caused by particle fluctuation. The constitutive equations for solid phase are derived from the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF). Some simplifications of the complicated theoretical equations with empirical correlations are adopted, to save computing time and skip the currently unknown phenomena. Drag coefficient between gas phase and solid phase is modified by the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) principle. A simplified description of reaction process is also adopted. The present model was applied to predict the hydrodynamic and combustion behaviors in a commercial 135 MW

The turbulent gas-solid flow field adjacent to the burner exit was measured by a 3-D phase particle Doppler analyzer (PDA). Experimental results show that with the exit structure, both mean velocity and turbulent velocity are of a wave-like distribution adjacent to the burner exit. Along the jet, the mean axial velocity decays fast while the turbulent axial velocity decays more slowly. The turbulent velocities in horizontal and vertical directions increase significantly.

The vertical two-dimensional numerical model for ice-covered flow is developed by the k-ε turbulence model. Based upon the theory of dimensional analysis the factors influencing the velocity distribution patterns are proposed. The numerical experiments for various combinations of factors are conducted, and the flow characteristics such as location of the maximum velocity, mean velocities of obth ice-affected region and bed-diffected region are analyzed. The accuracy of two-point depth-averaged flow measurement for ice-covered river is investigated.

33746239528	Numerical simulation of the gas flow field from a triple channel coal-water slurry gasifier nozzle	The influence of the design of a triple channel Texaco nozzle on the cold gas phase flow field in a gasifier was studied numerically by solving for the gas phase flow field produced by a triple channel Texaco nozzle and a single channel nozzle for both a free jet and a confined jet in a gasifier using Fluent. The result shows that the macro gas flow field produced by the Texaco nozzle is similar to that produced by the single channel nozzle. Obvious differences were only found near the nozzle outlet. Thus, the nozzle structure has less influence than the inlet velocity on the overall gasifier gas flow field. However, the analysis of the axial velocity and the radial velocity distribution near the nozzle outlet shows that for the triple channel nozzle, the enhanced mixing between the outside annular channel air flow and center channel air plays an important role in the coal-water slurry atomization process.

33748693928	Combustion characteristics of refuse derived fuels in circulating fluidised bed combustor	Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) is a technology which can use waste materials and low quality fuels along with coal. Mixed with wastes, coal can burn more efficiently. The present study aimed at the co-combustion of refuse derived fuels (RDF) with coal in a bench scale circulating fluidised bed combustor (CFBC). Tests were carried out at different ratios of RDF/coal at temperatures from 830 to 960°C. Compared with coal alone, RDF-coal mixtures gave a more uniform temperature distribution in the combustor and the emissions were lower when burning. Improved efficiency and stability of co-combustion were attributed to the higher volatile matter content in RDF. However, the advantages could be lessened if a too high secondary air ratio was used.

The low mass flow-speed vertical tube platen features natural circulation characteristics, guaranteeing a safe operation of boilers while simultaneously meeting comparatively low mass flow-speed requirements. Hence, the low mass flow-speed vertical tube platen technology has its own technical edge, especially for forced circulation pulverized coal-fired boilers and supercritical circulating fluidized bed ones which must adopt low mass flow-speed vertical tubes. The inner threaded tubes can reduce steam temperature deviation and flow resistance in water-cooled walls and secure a safer operation of the latter.

33846389284	System error present when measuring the carbon content of the fly-ash of a circulating fluidized bed boiler by using a loss-on-ignition method	To measure the carbon content of the fly ash of a CFB boiler one still continues to adopt the loss-on-ignition method traditionally used for measuring carbon content of the fly ash of pulverized coal-fired boilers. As the mineral constituent of the fly ash of a CFB boiler is different from that of a pulverized coal-fired one, the use of the loss-on-ignition method for measuring carbon content of the fly ash of a CFB boiler may produce a certain system error. The authors have adopted the loss-on-ignition method combined with a TGA-FTIR (thermogravimetric analyzer-Fourier infrared spectrum) method to measure the carbon content of the fly ash of the CFB boiler and analyzed the system error involved in the measurement by using the loss-on-ignition method. The results of the measurements show that in case of using China National Electric Power Industry Standard DL/L567.6-95 Method B for measuring combustible matter in fly ash and slag of a CFB boiler the system error should involve the decomposition of sulfate and release of water of crystallization and hydration from mineral constituents. When using this method to check the performance and efficiency of a CFB boiler unit, one shall take into account the effect of these factors. On the basis of TGA-FTIR experiments, presented is a new TGA method for measuring the carbon content of fly ash of a CFB boiler, which can avoid the system error caused by the decomposition of sulfate and the release of water of crystallization and hydration from mineral constituents. In the meantime, the system error resulting from high-temperature cracking of newly produced carbon-containing organic matter can be negligible. The result thus measured further approximates to the actual carbon content of the fly ash of the CFB boiler.

33846468747	Finite element analysis of the heat transfer coefficient of a membrane wall	The finite element was used to predict the effect of the membrane water wall structure in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactors on the heat transfer and the feasibility of heat transfer measurements from measured temperature differences. The results indicate that most of the predicted temperatures agree well with the Chinese Standard with the maximum temperatures being somewhat less than the standard. The fraction of heat absorbed in the fin as well as the maximum temperature increase with increasing pitch, while with increasing fin thickness, the fraction of heat adsorbed increases while the maximum temperature decreases. The temperature difference in the water wall was found to be linearly related to the heat transfer from the CFB to the membrane water wall. Measurements using this method in commercial CFB boilers compare reasonably well with heat balance results with the measurements somewhat higher because of the additional heat resistance in the welds.

33847294278	Properties of flash hydrated and agglomerated particles of CFB fly ashes	The fly ash (high carbon content and high unreacted CaO) recirculation in CFB is a typical method to improve the carbon burnout efficiency and the calcium utilization ratio. While the effectiveness of it is limited by the resident time and the reactivity of the re-injected fly ash particles. In the present research, an improved fly ash recirculation method is suggested in which the CFB fly ash is mixed with water or the mixtures of additives (such as waste water of paper mill, cement, sodium silicate, and carbide slag) and water in a blender. Then, this mixture is re-injected into the combustion chamber of CFB by a sludge pump. Because the temperature in CFB is higher, the fly ash was flash hydrated. At the same time, it was dehydrated and agglomerated. The size of agglomerates is bigger than that of original particle and their attrition rate is lower. Therefore the resident time of agglomerates is much longer than that of fine fly ash particles. The absorption of SO

The sensibility to grid quality, grid style and boundary types of these models were discussed. The accuracy and performance of these five turbulence models were evaluated according to the comparison of simulation results and cold test results. The S-A model and standard k-ε model had better compatibility with grid quality and type but poor simulation results. The RSM model had a too rigorous limitation of grid quality to predict velocity field correctly, while the RNG k-ε model and Realizable k-ε model had better numerical solution based on a reasonable grid.

34147217691	Influence of coal ash components on attrition characteristics in circulating fluidized bed	Using the static coal combustion and ash cold sieving experimental method, the attrition rate constants of four kinds of coal ash were measured. It was found that the attrition rate constant of the same coal ash decayed exponentially with increasing particle size, while the attrition rate constants of different kinds of coal ash with the same size were different. The coal ash components were found to cause the above phenomena. By assuming the coal ash mainly composed of metakaolin, quartz, ferric oxide and calcium oxide, the influences and tendency of coal ash components on attrition rate constant were deduced with the gray system theory and neural network.

The profile of the temperature, gas composition and its volume fraction, carbon conversion rate along the height of the gasifier were obtained, and the results were compared with that from continuous gasification. The comparison shows that the mixing of the material in the gasifier is enhanced and the average temperature is increased by staged oxygen injection, which is helpful to increase the gasification efficiency; at the same time, the highest temperature is decreased, which is beneficial to increase the service life of the refractory.

34250368879	Numerical simulating the gas-solid flow in square cyclone with a curved inlet	Separator is one key part of circulating fluidized bed boiler, and its performance has a crucial effect on the boiler's material balance and heat transfer. Besides the operating conditions, separator's performance depends on its structure parameters. In order to research on the square cyclone's structure parameters influence on its performance, gas flow in square cyclones with different parameters was predicted using Reynold stress model (RSM). Results show that there is much local secondary flow in square cyclone besides main vortex, such as spiral down-stream near surface and spiral up-steam at central zone. The secondary flow is one of the effect factors on the collection performance of square cyclone. The cyclone geometry size affects on the intensity and the position of the secondary flow, and then affects on the separation efficiency of the cyclone. Based on the gas flow field, the motion traces of particles in the cyclone were predicted using stochastic tracking model. It is found that the particles which enter the cyclone through the lower zone of the entrance are collected more easily than those through higher zone.

A sectional numerical model was used to solve the control equations for the particle mass and charge distributions to study the coagulation of fly ash particles with the R-R mass distribution with the charges having a Boltzmann distribution. The results show that the mass distribution of the coagulated ash particles still follows the R-R distribution and the same size particles have a Boltzmann charge distribution. The mean particle size increases and the distribution becomes narrow after coagulation in the electric field. Therefore, coagulation should be used between electrostatic precipitator fields to reduce superfine particle pollution from coal burning boilers.

The gas distributor equipped with the float nozzle has a unique pressure drop characteristic. It has a higher resistance than other nozzles which results in the formation of an effective barrier against backflow at low boiler loads, which results from the pressure fluctuation caused by bubble burst and solids coming from the recycle system. In addition, it has a relatively low pressure drop at high or full boiler loads, which can greatly reduce the energy cost of the primary air fan. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

It was found that within a wide range of inlet solid concentrations, i.e., 0.54-4.42 kg/kg-gas, the cyclone pressure drop increased linearly with inlet solid concentration at a given gas velocity, while the pressure drop between the dust exit and the vortex finder of the cyclone remained almost constant. Since particle holdup increases virtually linearly with solid flow rate, the particle holdup in the cyclone can be derived from the cyclone pressure drop, and therefore, an equation set was proposed to calculate the particle holdup from the cyclone pressure drop. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The results show that the local solid suspension concentration most strongly influences the heat transfer coefficients, with relative deviations more than 50%. The relative deviations of the heat transfer coefficients range from 5% to 50% for various bed gas velocities, bed temperatures, water or steam temperatures inside the tube, and thermal conductivity of the heated surface. The relative deviations are less than 5% for various flue gas radiation thicknesses, tube pitches, and tube diameters, which can be neglected.

The existing results for the variation of particle average residence time with fluidizing gas velocity are contradictory since they were obtained under different operation conditions. A cold CFB apparatus made of plexiglass was established with a riser of 5 m in height and 0.2 m in diameter and equipped with a standard Lapple cyclone. The particle holdup was directly measured by the mass in the cyclone when the system was shut down. The solid concentration at the cyclone inlet was kept in the range generally used in CFB boilers. The experimental results showed that the particle holdup in the cyclone was equal to ca. 10-40 % of the corresponding bed material in the riser and that it increases monotonously with both the fluidizing gas velocity and the initial static bed height, and approximately linearly with the solid circulation rate. In addition, within the experimental conditions, the cyclone pressure drop increases monotonously with particle holdup. It was found that the average residence time of the particles either increased or decreased linearly with the fluidizing gas velocity, depending on the initial static bed height. Nevertheless, both variation rates were very small. In a view of engineering applications, the average residence time of the particles in the cyclone is insignificantly affected by the fluidizing gas velocity, initial bed inventory and solid circulation rate, within the range of experimental conditions examined. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

34248139504	Experimental study of the structural optimization of square shaped cyclone separators	On a cold-state test rig, a structural optimization study has been conducted of a square shaped cyclone separator having an inlet of characteristic dimension D = 300 mm with an acceleration section. The study results show that with an increase in core tube diameter (d) and core tube inserting depth (s), the separation efficiency tends to go up at the beginning followed by a decrease. The inlet height-width ratio (a/b) and straight section height (h) have an interactive impact on the separation efficiency. With an increase in inlet height-width ratio a/b ,the separation efficiency goes up first and then decreases. When the inlet height-width ratio undergoes a change, the separation efficiency tends to change differently with a change in straight section height. When a/b is above 5.92, the separation efficiency will go down first with an increase in straight section height and then rise, attaining a minimum value at h/D = 2.3. When a/b is below 5.92, the above efficiency will decrease with an increase in straight section height. The resistance of the cyclone separator will increase with an increase in the inlet height-width ratio and decrease with an increase in straight section height. The optimized values of the four parameters can be given as follows respectively: d = 0.4D, s = 0.6D, a/b = 8 and h = 1.8D. In such a case, the corresponding resistance of the cyclone separator will be 1.22 kPa.

The intensity of fragmentation and attrition aere measured in the same apparatus but at different fluidizing velocities. It was found that the averaged size of the particles decreased by about 10-20% during the fragmentation process. The important factors for particle comminution include limestone types, heating rate, calcination condition and ambient CO2 concentration. Fragmentation mainly occurred in the first a few minutes in the fluidized bed and it was more intense than that in the muffle furnace at the same temperature. The original size effect was ambiguous, depending on the limestone type. The comminution caused by attrition mainly occurred during calcination process rather than sulphation process. The sulphation process was fragmentation and attrition resisted. The attrition rate of sulphate was similar to that of lime in trend, decaying exponentially with time, but was one-magnitude-order smaller than that of lime. Present experimental results indicate that fragmentation mechanism of the limestone is dominated by CO2 release instead of thermal stress. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

42549093691	Principle and application of the concentrated pulverized coal burner	In the process of developing pulverized coal burner for stabilization, a new igniting and flame stabilizing mechanism of pulverized coal burner is proposed. A dense pulverized coal flow is formed due to a rapid turn which separated the coal powder from the air flow. The separated coal powder moves forward into a high temperature back-flow zone and then stagnates at the high temperature area. The temperature of the coal powder is increased immediately. When the temperature reaches the igniting point, a small stabilized flame is formed and ignites the whole pulverized coal in the primary air flow. According to this theory, the concentrated pulverized burner and multi-concentrated pulverized burner are developed successfully, which are widely applied in the power plants with capacity range from 100 MW to 200 MW.

The result indicates that the model can predict the unbalance phenomenon. If no initiative control is done, the transverse flow of the solid particles in the furnace with breeches-legs is a positive feedback process. Thus additional negative feedback control is necessary to keep balance of the bed materials between the legs.

4744338153	Modeling research on char particle combustion behavior in CEB condition	The combustion efficiency is paid more attention on under the condition of circulating fluidized bed (CFB). Combustion in CFB is a complicated process, which is connected with the gas-solid flow and its heat and mass transfer. A simplified model of single char particle combustion was suggested in this paper, where the particle was assumed shrank. The collection efficiency of cyclone, oxygen concentration distribution, and mass transfer resistance were all considered. The numerical simulation results of carbon content in fly ash for different particle size for varies char agreed well the measurement from the CFB boiler for the same coal, which proves the reliability of the model. This model can explain the peak in carbon content in fly ash distribution vs. particle size. With this model, it can be indicated that there is a peak in the carbon content in fly ash distribution for varies particle size, where the diameter ranges from 20 to 50 micron, increasing the bed temperature or excess air ratio in the outlet of the furnace, the carbon content in fly ash could be decreased. While increasing the collection efficiency of the cyclone, the carbon content increases very little. This proposed us the limitation of the fly ash recirculation.

4744342917	Catalytic effect of mineral matter on char reactivity under CFBC temperature condition	Reactivity loss (deactivation) of char in pulverized coal firing boiler were proved in previous research, with different explanations including decreasing specific surface area, structural ordering of carbon, residual inert component and catalytic effect of mineral matter, etc. The main reasons, accepted gradually, are the ordering of turbostratic carbon structure and the loss of catalytic effect of mineral matter containing Ca, Na, K, Fe or other elements. After confirming the char deactivation under circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) temperature condition, the present paper is focused on the catalytic effect of mineral matter on char reactivity and three coal samples were studied experimentally. Interferences to experimental results caused by effects of coal inhomogeneity, particle size and volatile release on char properties were greatly reduced by special methods. Acid treatment method was used to remove the mineral matter in coal samples. The reactivity of different chars produced by treated and un-treated vitrinite-rich coal samples were measured and compared to determine the catalytic effects and influence factors. Experimental results show that catalytic effect decreases rapidly when temperature increases, and nearly disappears close to 1200°C. Char deactivation has been found to be due to the combined effect of the ordering of turbostratic carbon structure and the loss of catalytic effect of minerals under CFBC condition. But the different catalytic effects are observed for different coals. Different from sample YX, sample DT and JJ have little catalytic effect for covering the surface of coal particles and restraining the diffusion of oxygen.

56349158870	A novel method for prediction of particle dispersion in a planar jet using ODT model	The One Dimensional Turbulence (ODT) model was used to study a particle laden flow in a planar jet. As an outgrowth of the LEM (Linear Eddy Model) model, the ODT model maintains a distinction among the turbulence, molecular diffusion and chemical reaction scales. Additionally, the turbulent mixing process is only considered in one-dimension, where eddy events are stochastically represented, which allows for representation of a large range of time and length scales with relatively small computing requirements. In this study, the particle and fluid time scales are split by advancing the fluid phase independently of the particle phase. When an eddy was judged to occur, it is assumed that the eddy will always exist at this area. Therefore locations of the eddy occurrences in the fluid phase are recorded after each fluid advancement step. After the fluid phase has advanced, particles are tracked through the established flow field, interacting with the eddy occurrences. When a particle encounters an eddy, its motion is affected by the eddy velocity, which is a combination of the local gas flow field and turbulent mixing. With this method, eddy effects on the particle motion are considered. Different intensities of eddy effects on particle motion were compared. Particle dispersion rate is proportional to eddy effects. This suggests that turbulent eddies always have a positive effect on particle dispersion. Besides that, particle diameter has an important influence on particle-eddy interactions. Small particles are not sensitive to eddy effects, whereas medium particles are very sensitive to eddy effects. According to Budilarto's observation, a medium eddy shape factor is selected. Based on this eddy shape factor, the final results shows that particle diameter always has a negative effect on particle dispersion, causing large particles to concentrate at center of the jet while small particles disperse to the edge. A 2-way The ability of this ODT model to capture these dispersion effects provides motivation for applying it to particle-gas chemical processes, such as coal combustion and gasification where particle clustering and dispersion has been observed.

5644262613	Transition of the activation energy of semi-coke during its oxidation process	The activation energy of five kinds of semi-coke during its eigen oxidation in air was investigated by using a thermo-gravimetric balance. These semi-cokes were prepared from Datong coal, Shenmu coal, Yuxian coal, Jianjiang coal and Taiwan petroleum coke by pyrolysis for 7 minutes at a temperature of 900°C. A distributed activation energy model (DAEM) was employed to describe the transition of activation energy of semi-cokes during an oxidation process. Initially, the activation energy of Datong coal semi-coke assumes a minimum value. With an increase in carbon loss rate the activation energy will increase (the increase at initial period of reaction is relatively rapid), and decrease on reaching a peak value at a later period of reaction. The activation energy of Jianjiang coal semi-coke is very high at the initial period of reaction (as high as 250 kJ/mol). It decreases rather rapidly at first, but tends to decrease slowly when the carbon loss is assessed at 20%. As for the semi-coke of the other three kinds of coal their activation energy will experience respectively two peaks at the initial and later period of reaction with a relatively mild change between the two peaks. The different transition mechanisms of the activation energy specific to various kinds of semi-coke reflect their different internal qualities. As compared with coal cokes, the semi-coke of petroleum coke exhibits a relatively uniform internal structure.

When gas in the small cylinder is compressed, water is sprayed into it to reduce compression consuming. After being preheated in the regenerator, the compressed gas enters into the big cylinder and mixes with the fuel that has been injected into the big cylinder, and then combusts and does work. After doing work, the gas releases heat in regenerator and is discharged into air. The performance prediction model of the new engine system is constructed on the basis of an in-depth analysis of the new engine system. With this mathematic model, the thermal-efficiency of the new engine system is calculated under the conditions of different compression ratios, different maximal working temperatures and different piston efficiency. Compared with the conventional otto cycle and diesel cycle under the same conditions, the new engine system has higher thermal efficiency, at most 20% higher than that of the conventional gas engines.

60949093106	Carbon formation mechanism in fly ash of circulating fluidized bed boilers	Carbon formation mechanism in fly ash of circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler was explored through the measurement of the carbon content and the residual carbon pattern in fly ash of CFB boiler, the experimental study on char deactivation under the combustion temperature of CFB boiler, and the analysis of combustion process of coal particles in CFB boiler. Results show that the carbon content in fly ash is obvious non-uniform in practical operation of CFB boiler, and the chars are centralized in fly ash particles of 25~50 μm. Actual density and XRD measurements show that temperature and time are two conditions for char deactivation. When temperature is higher than 800°C, char deactivation begins, and the deactivation degree increases with increasing time. Since the char particles reside in the main circulating circuit for long time, the activity decreases. With the fragmentation and attrition of the char, it forms the fine residual carbon particle in the fly ash. While the coarse residual carbon particles in the fly ash are formed from the fine fuel particles, which pass through the furnace and escape from the separator before burning out.

61849134736	Ignition of single coal particle in a hot furnace under normal- And micro-gravity condition	An experimental study on ignition and combustion of single particles was conducted at normal gravity (1-g) and microgravity (μ-g) for three high volatile coals with initial diameter of 1.5 and 2.0 mm, respectively. The non-intrusive twin-color pyrometry method was used to retrieve the surface temperature of the coal particle through processing the images taken by a color CCD camera. At the same time, a mathematical model considering thermal conduction inside the coal particle was developed to simulate the ignition process. Both experiments and modeling found that ignition occurred homogeneously at the beginning and then heterogeneously for the testing coal particles burning at μ-g. Experimental results confirmed that ignition temperature decreased with increasing volatile content and increasing particle size. However, contradicted to previous studies, this study found that for a given coal with certain particle size, ignition temperature was about 50-80 K lower at μ-g than that at 1-g. The model predictions agreed well with the μ-g experimental data on ignition temperature. The criterion that the temperature gradient in the space away from the particle surface equaled to zero was validated to determine the commence of homogeneous ignition. Thermal conduction inside the particle could have a noticeable effect for determining the ignition temperature. With the consideration of thermal conduction, the critical size for the phase transient from homogeneous to heterogeneous is about 700 um at ambient temperature 1500 K and oxygen concentration 0.23. © 2009 The Combustion Institute.

64549101516	Measurements of solid concentration and particle velocity distributions near the wall of a cyclone	The particle velocity and concentration distribution in the near-wall region of the cyclone were experimentally studied. A series of measurements were conducted with fiber optical probes (FOPs). It was found the radial solid concentration distribution is severe non-uniform and particles agglomerate as dense spiral bands near the wall, moving downwards with a certain interval. On the cross-section plane, from the center to the wall, solid concentration increases. The average solid concentration near the wall increases with the gas velocity or solid concentration at the cyclone inlet. Along the moving particle bands, solid concentration increases and particle average velocity decreases. Under present experimental conditions, the thickness of the particle bands in the cylindrical section is about 4-12 mm. Particle velocity in the near-wall region is in the range of 0.5-2.5 m/s and its average value is insensitive to the operational parameters. The number of spiral bands increases with the cyclone's inlet gas velocity, and might be greatly influenced by the cyclone structure. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A compounded pressure drop mathematic model was developed and validated with the experimental data in a cold experimental test rig. The model calculation results agree well with the measured data. In addition, the intensity of bed inventory overturn is directly proportional to the fluidizing velocity and is inversely proportional to the branch point height.

67649446195	Combustion test by changing bed inventory on circulating fluidized bed boiler	Combustion tests were conducted by changing bed inventory on a 75 t/h circulating fluidized bed boiler. Within the bed pressure drop range of 3 220 Pa to 7330 Pa, the influences of bed inventory on boiler load, axial particle concentration distribution in the furnace and actual combustion efficiency were tested. Results show that the boiler can still maintain full load operation under the condition of low bed pressure drop which is far from the normal bed pressure drop, and combustion is improved. It is concluded that under the condition of proper control of fuel particle sizes, operation of circulating fluidized bed boiler under low bed pressure drop is not only feasible, bus can also optimize the integral operational performance of the boiler. It is the tendency of boiler design and operation optimization.

67749122632	Effect of bed pressure drop on performance of a CFB boiler	The effect of bed pressure drop and bed inventory on the performances of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler was studied. By using the state specification design theory, the fluidization state of the gas - solids flow in the furnace of conventional CFB boilers was reconstructed to operate at a much lower bed pressure drop by reducing bed inventory and control bed quality. Through theoretical analysis, it was suggested that there would exist a theoretical optimal value of bed pressure drop, around which the boiler operation can achieve the maximal combustion efficiency and with significant reduction of the wear of the heating surface and fan energy consumption. The analysis was validated by field tests carried out in a 75 t/h CFB boiler. At full boiler load, when bed pressure drop was reduced from 7.3 to 3.2 kPa, the height of the dense zone in the lower furnace decreased, but the solid suspension density profile in the upper furnace and solid flow rate were barely influenced. Consequently, the average heat transfer coefficient in the furnace was kept nearly the same and the furnace temperature increment was less than 17 °C. It was also found that the carbon content in the fly ash decreased first with decreasing bed pressure drop and then increased with further increasing bed pressure drop. The turning point with minimal carbon content was referred to as the point with optimal bed pressure drop. For this boiler, at the optimum point the bed pressure was around 5.7 kPa with the overall excess air ratio of 1.06. When the boiler was operated around this optimal point, not only the combustion efficiency was improved, but also fan energy consumption and wear of heating surface were reduced. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

69849108933	Analysis of dominating process between mixing and reactions in a texaco coal gasifier	In an entrained flow coal gasifier, strong coupling exists between turbulent flow and reaction. In order to figure out which factor in the mixing process, homogeneous reaction and heterogeneous reaction, dominates the coal gasification process in a Texaco gasifier, numerical simulations for a Texaco gasifier were carried out. Based on simulation results, time scales and length scales of turbulent flow and reactions in different regions of the gasifier were compared. The analysis shows that the interaction between species fluctuation and particle heterogeneous reactions is very important in the flame region and can't be neglected. In the non-flame region in the gasifier, slow reverse homogeneous reactions dominates gasification reactions. However, time scales of homogeneous reactions are much smaller than those of macro-mixing process. This means that the assumption that mixing process dominates gasification process in this region is reasonable and can be used in numerical modeling to predict the performance of an entrained coal gasifier.

The mass imbalance in the pant-legs and the horizontal flow of solid particles in the upper furnace are the key cause of bed inventory overturn. The heat transfer model is not only physically realistic, but also very efficient.

The observed deactivation of the unburnt carbon and the pyrolysis chars prepared under various conditions was studied and found to be due to the combination of the loss of catalytic effect of the minerals and the crystalline growth of carbon. Various forms of morphology of the residual carbon particles were examined under a microscope. Both inertinite and vitrinite seem to be possible sources of the unburnt carbon. The formation of the unburnt carbon in the CFB fly ashes was likely caused by the deactivation of char particles and the insufficient residence time of the corresponding fuel particles.

0034473399	Hydrodynamics of large jetting fluidized bed	Voidage distribution along radial and axial directions in a cold flow semicircular fluidized bed 500 mm in diameter and 8000 mm in height was measured with a PC-4 optic fiber probe. The radial voidage profile is divided into jet and emulsion phase regions. The radial voidage profile in the jet region has an elliptic contour, but the voidage in the emulsion phase region is found to be equal to that under minimum fluidizating conditions. An empirical correlation for predicting the jet region voidage is proposed. The time series of pressure fluctuation are analyzed by deterministic chaos theory and power spectrum density function, and effects of jet gas velocity and static bed height on the correlation dimension and on major frequency are investigated. It is found that the major frequency (jet collapse frequency) increases with jet gas velocity. The results show that the correlation dimension increases with jet gas velocity. For a given jet gas velocity, the higher the static bed height, the greater the correlation dimension.

0035453737	Flow regime transition and penetration depth of large jetting fluidized bed	In a 0.5 meter diameter semicircular jetting fluidized bed with 42 mm diameter semicircular nozzle, the transition of flow regime and the penetration depth were investigated. The penetration depth was recorded by a National M-7 video camera and analyzed frame to frame on a Panasonic HD-100 player. There were two flow patterns of jet and spout in a large jetting fluidized bed with increasing jet gas velocity. Spout appeared when jet gas velocity was high and static bed height was relatively low. The results from processing the signals of pressure fluctuation by multistage power spectrum analysis showed that the major frequency of pressure fluctuation increased with jetting gas velocity. On the basis of the experimental data, an equation describing flow regime transition was presented. Meanwhile, experimental data showed that penetration depth increased with the increase of jetting gas velocity. A correlation to penetration depth was also proposed.

72449129106	An analysis of thermal inertia of a CFB (circulating fluidized bed) boiler	The thermal inertia of a CFB (Circulating Fluidized Bed) boiler represents an important factor affecting the boiler dynamic characteristics. From the standpoint of a dynamic energy balance, defined was the thermal inertia of the CFB boiler. For boilers rated at 6 different capacities, calculated respectively were their thermal inertia magnitudes in various links of energy transfer. The calculation results show that the total thermal inertia magnitude of a boiler increases with an increase of its capacity, however, its unit evaporative capacity decreases with an increase of its capacity. Thermal inertia of a working medium and refractory materials constitutes a control link in the energy transfer process. As far as an economizer is concerned, metallic thermal inertia is of equal importance to that of a working medium. The thermal inertia of refractory materials in superheaters/reheaters is of the same magnitude order as the metallic thermal inertia. In water walls/panels, the working medium thermal inertia is considered as the biggest.

74849094476	Experimental study on the ignition process of single coal particles at microgravity	In this paper, the first Chinese microgravity (μ-g) experimental study on coal combustion was introduced. An experimental system used to study the ignition process of single coal particles was built up, complying with the requirements of the 3.5 s drop tower in the National Microgravity Laboratory of China (NMLC). High volatile bituminous and lignite coal particles with diameter of 1.5 and 2.0 mm were tested. The ignition and combustion process was recorded by a color CCD and the particle surface temperature before and at the ignition was determined by the RGB colorimetric method. Comparative experiments were conducted at normal gravity (1-g). The experiments revealed that at different gravity levels, the ignition of all tested coal particles commenced in homogeneous phase, while the shape, structure, brightness and development of the flames, as well as the volatile matter release during the ignition process are different. At μ-g, the part of volatile was released as a jet, while such a phenomenon was barely observed at 1-g. Also, after ignition, flames were more spherical, thicker, laminated and dimmer at μ-g. It was confirmed that ignition temperature decreased as the particle size or volatile content increased. However, contradicted to existing experimental results, provided other experimental conditions except gravity level were the same, ignition temperature of coal particles was about 50-80 K lower at μ-g than that at 1-g. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

75149123611	Effect of the additives on the desulphurization rate of flash hydrated and agglomerated CFB fly ash	CFB fly ash from separators was mixed with water or the mixture of water and additives under the temperature of 363K by use of a blender. Then, this compound of fly ash and water or additives was pumped into a CFB combustion chamber by a sludge pump. Because the temperature of flue gas was high in CFB, the fly ash was hydrated fast and agglomerated in the same time. Through this process, the size of agglomerating fly ash is larger than the original particle and the relative residence time of agglomerated fly ash in CFB becomes longer. Therefore, the rate of utility of calcium in fly ash improves and the content of carbon in fly ash decreases. This results in a low Ca/S and low operational cost for CFB boiler. The additive is one key factor, which affects the rate of desulfurization of agglomerated fly ash. Effect of different additives on rate of desulfurization is not same. Cement and limestone are beneficiated to sulfur removal of agglomerated fly ash, but sodium silicate does not devote to the rate of sulfur removal of agglomerated fly ash.

In the model, the CFB is regarded as a superposition of two sub-beds, a fast fluidized bed in the upper riser with a characteristic particle diameter of 0.2mm and a bubbling fluidized bed or turbulent bed in the bottom riser with a characteristic particle diameter of 2mm. Furthermore, a variable critical particle diameter whose terminal velocity equals to the superficial gas velocity was employed to determine which flow regime the particle belongs to. The results show that binary particle diameter model has the advantages in describing wide particle diameter distribution while reducing the complexity of computation. The model was verified by the field data of voidage profile in a 300MW CFB boiler.

75149136227	Characteristics of a modified bell jar nozzle designed for CFB boilers	One of the most important factors for trouble free operation of CFB boilers is the pressure drop of the gas distributor. The pressure drop characteristic of the gas distributor depends on the nozzles used. A modified bell jar nozzle was designed and developed for use with large-scale industrial circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers. The nozzle consists of a vertically tapered tube with a larger end at the top, a float which is free to move within the tube and a cover with holes. The pressure drop characteristics of the nozzle were measured experimentally by using different floats and moving out the float respectively. The gas distributor equipped with the modified bell jar nozzle has a unique pressure drop characteristic. It has a higher resistance than other nozzles which results in the formation of an effective barrier against backflow at low boiler loads, which results from the pressure fluctuation caused by bubble burst and solids coming from the recycle system. In addition, it has a relatively low pressure drop at high or full boiler loads, which can greatly reduce the energy cost of the primary air fan.

75149148228	Combustion model for a CFB boiler with consideration of post-combustion in the cyclone	Severe post combustion in the cyclone of CFB boilers could destroy heat absorbing balance among the heating surfaces and cause overheating problem for reheaters and superheaters. However, post combustion in the cyclone is rarely considered in the design phase of a CFB boiler. Based on our previous experiment results, group combustion model is used in this study to estimate the combustion of particles in the cyclone. It is found that the combustion of particles in the cyclone did not contribute as much as we anticipated to the temperature augment in the cyclone because of great oxygen diffusion resistance in near-wall particle layer. Post combustion model in the cyclone is then added into a one-dimensional combustion model of CFB boiler, in which the gas-solid flow, reaction, and heat absorption at different vertical locations in a CFB boiler can be well predicted with the knowledge of operation parameters. The new model was used to estimate the influence of some operation parameters on the post combustion in the cyclone and heat releasing fraction in the cyclone. The prediction results are very good.

75149148785	Experimental study on heat transfer in a rolling ash cooler used in the CFB boiler	From the view of the reliability and the techno-economy, the rolling ash cooler is feasible for the large-scale CFB boilers. However, existing studies on heat transfer in rolling ash cooler mainly focused on heat balance calculation and cold, hot test on the ash cooler outputs. In the heat balance calculation, the value of the overall heat transfer coefficient (a) is usually estimated by the experience, lacking of the support of experimental data. In this paper, a dynamic experimental system was built to measure the overall ain the rolling ash cooler and the influencing factors, including ash size, ash amount and rotational speed, using the orthogonal design. The results showed that the ash size has the greatest effect on a, and rotating speed has the least. The heat transfer in rolling ash cooler could be enhanced by increasing the rotating speed and decreasing the ash size. The aincreased with ash amount when the ash amount is small, but keep nearly constant when ash amount exceeds a certain value.

Experimental study on the heat transfer in a commercial 300MWe CFB boiler was conducted. The αfrom the bed to the water wall was measured by the finite element method (FEM), at five different heights. The influence of suspension density and bed temperature on αwas analyzed. It was found that the pressure difference between the inlet and exit of the three cyclones, and the chamber pressure of the corresponding loop seal were not equal. The results indicated the suspension solid density was non-uniform in the cross section at a certain height. Consequently, the distributions of heat flux and α in the horizontal plane in the furnace was non-uniform. The furnace can divided into three sections according to the arrangement of the platen superheaters hanging in the upper CFB furnace. In each section, the heat flux near the center showed increasing trend.

In this study, a cold CFB test rig with a riser of 240mm in I.D. and 38m and 54m in height was built. The influences of operating conditions, such as solid inventory and fluidizing gas velocity, on the axial voidage profile along the riser were assessed. When the gas velocity exceeds the transport velocity, the S-shaped profile of voidage in the riser was established. At the same time, the voidage in top-dilute section reached the saturation carrying capacity, and the solids circulation rate did not vary with the height of the riser nor the solids inventory. It was also found the critical solids inventory for the saturation carrying capacity increases as the riser height increases. When the height was changed from 38m to 54m, the critical solids inventory increased about 25% from about 40kg to about 50kg, and pressure drop in the furnace also increased about 25%.

77649083126	Effects of turbulent mixing and controlling mechanisms in an entrained flow coal gasifier	There is a large range of time and length scales of turbulent fluctuations in an entrained flow coal gasifier. To figure out the turbulent effects on coal gasification processes and the controlling mechanisms of different regions in an entrained flow coal gasifier, the characteristic time and length scales for all major processes are estimated. On the basis of the comparison between the length/timescales of turbulent mixing in all ranges and the characteristic time of homo- and heterogeneous reactions, turbulent effects on reactions and coal gasification processes in different regions in an entrained coal gasifier are studied. In the flame region, there is a strong coupling effect between macro-scale turbulent fluctuation and heterogeneous reactions. The combustion of the volatile is strongly affected by the fluctuation of micro-scale Kolmogorov scales because the diffusion boundary layer of the particles is destroyed by this kind of fluctuation. In the nonflame region, the heterogeneous char gasification reactions are not affected by turbulent fluctuations; however, the coupling effect between turbulent mixing and gas-phase reactions should not be omitted.

In this model, a presumed probability density function (PDF) method is used to consider turbulent effects on gas-phase reactions in the gasifier. A realizable k-ε model is adopted to predict turbulence information. Coal slurry particles are tracked with the Lagrangian method. The coal slurry gasification process is divided into several simple subprocesses, which are droplet evaporation, boiling, devolatilization, and heterogeneous reactions of coal char particles. The particle-source-in-cell method is adopted to couple gas-particle interactions. With this methodology, simulations for GE and staged coal slurry gasifiers are completed. A comparison between the predictions and measured data shows that the proposed model correctly predicts the global performance of the coal gasification process. The mixing process in the staged gasifier is better than that in the GE gasifier because of the existence of secondary flow. The particle size has a negative effect on coal conversion. The effects of the coal slurry concentration and molar ratio of oxygen/carbon on the gasifier performance are also studied in this paper. Copyright © 2010 American Chemical Society.

The experimental results show that the lateral pressure distribution inside the riser is nonuniform. Two possible mechanisms counting for the lateral solid transfer, i.e. solid diffusion mechanism and gas transport mechanism were discussed and analyzed. According to the experimental results, the motion of the solid particles is driven by the lateral pressure gradient of the gas phase in the bed, and hence is dominated by the gas transport mechanism. It is proposed that with pant-leg structure in the bottom furnace, the lateral pressure difference between two sides of the furnace and the axial pressure profile on each side of furnace should be monitored with the autocontrol system to avoid the bed inventory overturn. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77952555149	Postcombustion and its influences in 135 MWe CFB boilers	In the cyclone of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler, a noticeable increment of flue gas temperature, caused by combustion of combustible gas and unburnt carbon content, is often found. Such phenomenon is defined as postcombustion, and it could introduce overheating of reheated and superheated steam and extra heat loss of exhaust flue gas. In this paper, mathematical modeling and field measurements on postcombustion in 135MWe commercial CFB boilers were conducted. A novel one-dimensional combustion model taking postcombustion into account was developed. With this model, the overall combustion performance, including size distribution of various ashes, temperature profile, and carbon content profiles along the furnace height, heat release fraction in the cyclone and furnace were predicted. Field measurements were conducted by sampling gas and solid at different positions in the boiler under different loads. The measured data and corresponding model-calculated results were compared. Both prediction and field measurements showed postcombustion introduced a temperature increment of flue gas in the cyclone of the 135MWe CFB boiler in the range of 20-50 °C when a low-volatile bituminous coal was fired. Although it had little influence on ash size distribution, postcombustion had a remarkable influence on the carbon content profile and temperature profile in the furnace. Moreover, it introduced about 4-7% heat release in the cyclone over the total heat release in the boiler. This fraction slightly increased with total air flow rate and boiler load. Model calculations were also conducted on other two 135MWe CFB boilers burning lignite and anthracite coal, respectively. The results confirmed that postcombustion was sensitive to coal type and became more severe as the volatile content of the coal decreased.

77957932938	Experimental study on the angle of repose of pulverized coal	An experimental study on the angle of repose (AoR) of pulverized coal with different particle sizes and different moisture contents (MC) was conducted. Three different measurement methods, free-base piling, fixed-base piling and sliding, were used. The data were analyzed by one-way and two-way analysis of variance. The results showed that the AoRs of pulverized coal with particle sizes smaller than 150 μm were in the range of 30-50°. The characterization of the flowability of pulverized coal was some cohesiveness or true cohesiveness. The increase of MC will increase AoR and thus decrease the flowability of the powder. However, the particle size effect is bifurcated. Below a critical size, the decrease of particle size decreases the flowability; while above the critical size, the decrease of particle size increases the flowability. It was found that the value of the critical size strongly depends on the powder density. Moreover, the AoR dependence on particle size could be linked with the Geldart's particle classification. The critical size at the turning point is on the boundary between Group A and Group B in Geldart's classification diagram. Based on the experimental results, there is no significant cross interaction between particle size and MC. The AoRs measured by free-base method and fixed-base method are close, but both remarkably smaller than that measured by the sliding method. © 2010 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The experimental results showed that the flow behavior in the standpipe is not only strongly related to the particle holdup, the structure, and the aeration flow rate of the standpipe and loop seal but also strongly coupled with the pressure drops of the rest of the parts of the CFB system.

79955953511	Experimental study of the two-dimensional effect on the laminar flame speed measurements using the counterflow technique	the 2-D velocity field of the counterflow was measured by using PIV with equivalence ratio φ in 0.6~0.75, the deviation of laminar flame speeds obtained along the line offset 1~6 mm from the centerline and along the centerline were analyzed. The experimental results showed that if the measurement was offset from the centerline, the relative measure error might is introduced. For weakly burning flames, the two-dimensional effect was obvious for methane/air flames at φ = 0.6, if the offset distance from the centerline is 5 mm, relative error might reach to 33%, for stronger flame (φ > 0.7), the relative error was smaller, for φ = 0.75 of methane/air mixtures, the relative error was less than 5% compared with the data measured along the centerline. In conclusion, for the weak flames, the measurement must be taken along the centerline for accuracy determination of the laminar flame speeds.

0035521365	Hydrodynamic characteristics in large jetting fluidized BED with double nozzles	In a φ0.5 m × 8 m semicircular jetting bed with double nozzles using millet as fluidized material, studies of various flow regimes, i.e., separate jet regime, transition flow regime and jet coalescence regime were carried out. The equations of transition of flow regimes were proposed. Experimental results indicated that penetration depth increased with the increase of jet gas velocity, while penetration depth decreased with the decrease of nozzle pitch. A relationship of penetration depth and nozzle distance in a large jetting fluidized bed with double nozzles was obtained. With smaller nozzle distance, jet coalescence always occurred and jet coalescence height replaced the penetration depth. Thus, a correlation of jet coalescence height was also presented.

The static bed height was varied from 0.38 to 0.66 m, and the nozzle jet velocity was varied from 16.1 to 64.26 m/s. A correlation was developed using experimental data to predict the transition of the flow pattern from a jet to a spout. The study shows that the major frequency in the power spectrum density function agrees with the jet collapse frequency measured by frame-by-frame analysis and Sth VCD software analysis. The major frequency in the power spectrum density function increases with increasing jet gas velocity. In addition, the jet velocity at the critical point in the curve of the major frequency versus the jet gas velocity corresponds to the gas velocity for the transition from a jet to a spout.

79959190871	Experimental study of dense phase pneumatic coal conveying in an airslide conveyor	Systematic experimental work was carried out on a 7 m long airslide conveying system to study the characteristics of dense phase coal conveying. Experimental results show that the maximum conveying capacity increases firstly and then reaches a steady value of 0.25 kg/s as the superficial air velocity increases. Pulverized coal cannot be conveyed when the inclination angle is less than 5°. When the inclination angle is in a range of 5°~7°, the saturated solid mass flow rate and the maximum solid/gas mass ratio do not show a big change. However, there is a larger range of air velocities when the maximum solid/gas ratio appears under a larger inclination angle. The height of the conveyor cross section has an important effect on the conveying capacity. The flow mode changes to pulsatory flow mode from fixed bed and finally reaches a sliding bed mode with the increase of air velocity.

84863151375	Numerical investigation of effects of secondary oxygen ratio on performance of staged-entrained flow coal gasifier	The staged oxygen entrained flow coal-slurry gasifier has such advantages as higher carbon conversion rate, stronger turbulent mixing inside gasifier and lower temperature near coal slurry nozzle. In this paper, the effects of secondary oxygen mass flow rate (SOMFR) on gasification performance were numerically investigated through CFD simulation. The CFD model was based on the Euler-Lagrangian method. Realizable k-ε model was used to acquire the turbulent information in the gasifier. Presumed PDF method was adopted to consider interactions between turbulence and homogeneous reactions. The characteristics of the gasification flames were analyzed as well as the flow field under different SOMFR in the staged gasifier. As SOMFR decreased, the secondary gasification flame curved up with backflow near the wall. At the same time, dome wall temperature increased as well. When SOMFR was less than 8% of the total oxygen mass flow rate, the momentum flux of the secondary oxidizer is too low to change the macro flow field. When SOMFR was larger than 8% of the total oxygen mass flow rate, the recirculation region shrank due to the entrainment of secondary flow. However, particle residence time increased, since the velocity in back-flow region increased. Particle gasification process would be benefited from this change. As SOMFR increased, the down-flow flame length decreased as well as the average temperature in the top furnace region. The result showed that the average temperature decreased by 20°C when SOMFR increased from 2% to 16% of the total oxygen mass flow rate. At the height where secondary oxygen was introduced, the average temperature increased by 300°C as well. In all cases, the temperature flow field at the down-section of the gasifier did not change, since the oxygen-coal mass ratio was kept constant. © All Rights Reserved.

84866065724	Mass balance performance of a 300MW CFB boiler burning blend fuel with different mixing ratio	In order to predict the mass balance of a 300MWe circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler under design process, the ash formation and attrition characteristic of the design fuel mixed with gangue, middling and slime were investigated with Tshinghua own process. In addition, the mass balance in this CFB boiler was simulated with 1D mass balance model, giving the ratio of the ashes, particle size distribution of circulating solid materials and solid circulating rat, Gs. By comparing the residence time distribution and the burn out time required for different size, the minimum bed pressure drop (BPD) or bed inventory in the furnace was determined for different mixing ratio among the three coals. The results show that under each mixing ratio, the solid circulating flux and solid suspension density in the upper furnace can meet the requirement of heating transfer. However, the minimum BPD or bed inventory required to meet the burn out time of the coarse solids was different. For in the case with the ratio among gangue, middling and slime as 5:3:2, the lowest value is 12kPa, which will cause serious erosion and more power consumption. Because the middling has lower ash content, higher reactivity and better ash formation, increasing the proportion of the middling (1:5:4) will decrease the BPD greatly to 5kPa, not only meet the requirements of material balance and burn time for coarse solids easily, but also realize the energy saving operation. © Tsinghua University Press, Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84866070048	Effects of the secondary oxygen injection on the performance of a staged-entrained flow caol gasifier	In a staged entrained flow coal-slurry gasifier, the secondary oxygen was injected into the gasifier in order to protect the refractory in the dome region, to improve the mixing process as well as gasification performance. Based on a proposed 3-D numerical model, simulations were conducted for the staged gasifier at different mass flow rates of the secondary oxidizer. The characteristics of the gasification flames were analyzed as well as the influence of the secondary flow on the flow field of the staged gasifier. As the mass flow rate of the secondary oxidizer decreases, the secondary gasification flame curves up according to the backflow region and wall temperature increases. When the mass flow rate of the secondary oxidizer is less than 10% of the total oxidizer mass flow rate, there is an obvious change of the turbulent mixing in the staged gasifier. © Tsinghua University Press, Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

0036976863	Pressure fluctuations in a bubbling fluidized bed at high temperature	Pressure fluctuations are investigated in an 82 mm i.d. and 1500 mm high stainless steel bubbling fluidized bed at a temperature ranging from ambient temperature to 1000°C, using four coal ashes of various average size as fluidized materials. Pressure fluctuation signals are analyzed by using statistics analysis, power spectrum density function analysis, and wavelet analysis. Experimental results indicate that pressure fluctuation standard deviation (PFSD) increases with increasing fluctuation number at various temperatures. At the same fluidization number, for Geldart B ash, there is little variation of PFSD with an increase of bed temperature. For Geldart D ash, PFSD decreases with increasing bed temperature. Major frequency in power spectrum density function (PSDF) decreases with increasing fluidization number. Pressure fluctuation signals consist of low frequency components and high frequency component with small fraction. On basis of discrete wavelet transform, an original signal is resolved into five detailed scale signals (from detailed scale 1 to detailed scale 5) and a fifth analogue signal. The peak number per second in detailed scale 5 is agreement with the bubble formation frequency.

It is very clear that the rate of different organic sulfur removal from coal is not same. Usually aliphatic sulfur is easily removed and thiophenic sulfur is difficultly oxidized. Then, the mechanism of organic sulfur removal from coal by electrolysis in acid or alkaline media was investigated by the use of XPS and FT-IR.

0037055068	Dynamics of pressure fluctuation in a bubbling fluidized bed at high temperature	Dynamic behaviors were investigated using ashes of three sizes in an 82-mm-i.d. stainless steel fluidized bed at temperatures up to 1000 °C. Pressure fluctuation signals were analyzed using power spectral density function (PSDF) analysis, chaos analysis, and wavelet analysis. The major frequency of the pressure fluctuation signals is in the range from 20 to 80 Hz in the fixed state, whereas the major frequency ranges from 1 to 9 Hz in the fluidized state. The correlation dimension and Kolmogorov entropy are zero in the fixed state, and then they increase with increasing fluidization number in the transition region. Finally, these two exponents vary little with changing fluidization gas velocity in the fully fluidized state. Through a wavelet transform, the fluctuating pressure signals of the bed can be decomposed into approximations and details at different resolutions. The number of peaks in the five-detail signal represents the bubble formation frequency, which is in agreement with the major frequency obtained from a PSDF analysis of the pressure signals.

0036869619	Method of calculation of heat transfer coefficient of the heater in a circulating fluidized bed furnace	Knowledge of heat transfer coefficients is important in the design and operation of CFB boilers. It is the key to determining the area and the layout of the heat transfer surfaces in a CFB furnace. Local bulk density has a close relationship to the local heat transfer coefficient. Using a heat flux probe and bulk density sampling probe, the local bed to wall heat transfer coefficient in the furnace of a 75 t/h CFB boiler was measured. According to the experimental results and theoretical analysis of the facts that influence the heat transfer, the heat transfer coefficient calculation method for the CFB furnace was developed. The heat transfer surface configuration, heating condition, and the material density are considered in this method. The calculation method has been used in the design of CFB boilers with a capacity from 130 t/h to 420 t/h. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Ashes of three sizes (Geldart B) from pressurized fluidized bed boiler were used as fluidization materials. Experiments show that the minimum fluidization velocity decreases with increasing bed temperature. Pressure fluctuation signals were analyzed by using power spectral density function (PSDF), chaos, and wavelet analysis. The major frequency of pressure fluctuation signals is in the range from 1 to 4 Hz in the fluidized state. It demonstrates that a bubbling fluidized bed at high temperature is a deterministic chaos system since all the largest Lyapunov exponents are positive. The correlation dimension and Kolmogorov entropy increase with an increase in the fluidization number, and then they vary little with increasing fluidization gas velocity. By the wavelet transform, the fluctuating pressure signals in the bed can be decomposed into its approximations and details at different resolutions. The number of peaks in the scale six detail signal represents the number of bubbles passing through pressure probe measurement region over the sampling time, which agrees with the major frequency obtained from PSDF analysis of pressure fluctuation signals. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0038135212	Investigation on the ash size distribution and attrition during the coal combustion in fluidized bed	The character of ash formation and its attrition under the condition of circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion is one of the key factors that affect not only the fluidization character but also the CFB boiler performance. It is suggested that the fragmentation process would have no effect on the particle attrition, which is much different from the previous work. Then the experimental method of coal static combustion and ash cold fluidizing is proposed to get the intrinsic ash formation data and attrition data. A concept of intrinsic ash formation is proposed. The intrinsic ash formation data are only dependent on the fuel itself, which should be considered as a parameter of fuel during the CFB boiler design.

84869985163	Research on the anthracite pyrolysis property by thermogravimetric analysis	Experiments were performed in a TGA apparatus to investigate the pyrolysis properties of one kind of anthracite from Leiyang Power Plant, which has been used by several boilers. The effects of pulverized coal particle size, heating rate and final pyrolysis temperature on the volatile release property are presented. Experimental results confirmed that high heating rate could promote the volatile release rate at the primary period of pyrolysis. However, the complete pyrolysis still needs enough time. The final pyrolysis temperature also strongly affects the amount of volatile matters, while the effect of particle size can be ignored. So the total volatile yields are effected not only by the heating rate but also by the final pyrolysis temperature. The conclusion is different from the former results that volatile yields are independent of the heating rate. These results indicate the anthracite's volatile matter come out parallel with the char combustion, which are similar for the different size pulverized coal particles. © 2009 IEEE.

0141483785	Retrofitting of a planar separator circulating fluidized bed boiler	A significant problem in first generation circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers in China in the early 1990s was that they could not be easily operated at design load because the collection efficiency of separators such as the planar flow separator was quite poor. The performance of a 75 t/h planar flow separator in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler was improved by replacing the planar flow separator with a water-cooled square cyclone with a particle accelerating inlet. The heating surface was also adjusted to ensure the best performance, while the overall configuration and supporting frame were not changed. Subsequent operating experience showed that the retrofitted CFB boiler could operate at design load with a reasonable temperature distribution in the main circulating loop. Thus, such retrofitting of CFB boilers is an effective means of improving boiler performance.

0041464956	Influence of activation time on characteristics of active coke	Activating time effects significantly the characteristics of active cokes prepared from coal-derived char by steam activation. The active cokes for different activating time were investigated using XPS and other methods. The experimental results show that the surface area and micropore area of the active coke increases with activating time. And the ratio of micropore area to surface area increases too. At the earlier stages of activation, the micro-porous structure is mainly developed. With the activation time goes on, the micro-porous structure is developed in the form of forming the micro-pores and widening the already-formed pores; and the surface basicity of active coke also increases. The quantity of oxygen on the surface of active coke decreases and the activity of delocalized π-electron in the graphene layers of active coke become stronger. So the surface basicity of the active coke is mainly ascribed to the delocalized π-electron in the graphene layers.

84902650198	Investigation on load control of a 600mw supercritical circulating fluidized bed boiler	Load control is the core of boiler operation control system and is important for the safe and stable of the power plant. The operation of the first 600MW supercritical CFB unit that was recently built in Baima, China showed that the supercritical CFB boiler, differing from the pulverized coal boilers, was featured with large thermal inertia in the furnace. With the conventional load control scheme, the boiler operation was unstable and main steam parameters remarkably deviated from the designed values. Thus, a novel load control scheme was proposed based on the concept of "Burning carbon". During the load adjustment, the amount of burning carbon was kept nearly unchanged in the furnace by controlling the changes of coal feeding, flow rates of the primary and secondary airs, and air to coal ratio. The thermal inertia effect was also considered in the control of feedwater. The application showed that the proposed load control scheme improved the dynamic performance of the boiler, shortening the response time and remaining the main steam pressure and the main steam temperature stable during the load adjustment process.

It was assumed that the lateral was driven by the suspension density gradient of solid particles. The simulation results showed that bed inventory imbalance among the legs is a positive feedback process. When inventory imbalance occurs, heat transfer and combustion in the furnace become laterally non-uniform. In an extreme, it can cause an accident in CFB boiler operation. In order to resume the bed inventory balance, a real-time adjustment of primary air flowrate in each leg should be employed, to form a negative feedback control loop.

Two cold models, made in plexiglass, were scaled down from the real boiler dimensions in 1:20 scale and established in the laboratory. The boilers feature three cyclones asymmetrically arranged on one side of the furnace. With the scaling law, bed materials with proper size and density, and operation conditions were chosen. The pressure distributions along the recycle loops were measured under different operation conditions. For the cold model of the 300MWe CFB boiler, the gas flow field near furnace outlets was measured with particle image velocimetry (PIV). Corresponding CFD modeling was conducted with FLUENT software. Present study showed that in the CFB boiler equipped with multiple cyclones, no matter in asymmetric layout or not, each recycle loop has independent pressure balance. Solid circulating rate in each recycle loop, and hereby solid suspension density in the furnace, can be separately controlled by adjusting the aeration rate. For CFB boilers with cyclones in asymmetric layout, by the means of aeration rate adjustment, the solid circulating rates can be controlled within 5% deviation.

An experimental study was conducted in a plexiglass CFB cold apparatus, with a riser of 0.2m I.D. and 5m high, and a standard Lapple cyclone. The experimental results showed that the particle hold-up in the cyclone increased linearly with the solid circulating rate. Thereby the average residence time of the particles was inappreciably affected by the experiment conditions. Under a certain operational condition it is possible to easily obtain the inlet solid concentration in the cyclone by measuring the cyclone pressure drop. An empirical correlation was proposed for calculating the solids circulating rate from the pressure drop and some other operational parameters of the CFB boiler. The spiral-type particle motion, characterized by the number of spiral turns, the thread interval and width, was measured under various operational conditions. It was found that when the gas velocity at the cyclone inlet increases, the number of spiral turns increases and the thread interval decreases. The radial distributions of the voidage and the particle velocity in the spiral band were also measured.

To select coal particles of similar density in the target size of 500 μm to investigate different coal particles sorting effects caused by different fluidization speeds. Besides, the dehydration process during the separation was also revealed. The results showed that with the increase of air flow rate, the diameter of the particles in fluidization increased obviously, and the drying of the coal particles became more remarkable. When the air velocity reached to 1.84 m/s, the best separation results could be obtained. The coal particles smaller than 500 μm were up to 99.7% in the fine product, while as low as 28.7% in the coarse product. The moisture in the fuel could be reduced by 44. 58%. Both effective segregation and dehydration were obtained in the processing.

Because of the temperature of flume gas is high in CFB, the fly ash was hydrated fast and agglomerated at the same time. Through this process, the size of agglomerating fly ash is larger than the original particle. The combustion of agglomerated fly ash was studied by thermal balance (TA2100). It is obvious that weight loss of original and agglomerated fly ash is not different.

The starting pyrolysis temperature changed little with the decrease of the ratio of coal to petroleum coke, the rate of volatile release slowed down, the temperature corresponding to the maximum rate of volatile release increased, and the final weight loss was reduced.

The activated char derived from Binxian coal has comparatively high desulfurization capability because of its rich microporous texture and high surface basicity. Binxian coal is a suitable raw material of activated char for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) because of its comparatively high volatile content and high oxygen content. The carbonization conditions (carbonization temperature 400-800°C, carbonization time 0-60 min) have little effect on the desulfurization capability of the activated char prepared. Thus the activated char for FGD can be prepared from Binxian coal through one step of fluidizing bed process.

Under high pressure conditions, weight loss of coal during pyrolysis in different gas at different gas residence time was studied at first. Compared with the volatile matter of coal, the rate of weight loss is higher in hydrogen at a short gas residence time, but lower in nitrogen at a long gas residence time. The rate of weight loss during pyrolysis in nitrogen is less than that in hydrogen at a short gas residence time. The agglomeration of slightly caking or non-caking coal during rapid pyrolysis was investigated. When slightly caking or non-caking coals were treated at high pressure and rapid heating rate, char from these coals formed into the cylinder and did not fall to pieces. The force strength of char from some coals (Strongman coal, Xinglong coal) treated in hydrogen is higher than that in nitrogen.
