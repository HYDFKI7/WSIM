84940204053	WWOX suppresses KLF5 expression and breast cancer cell growth	The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer. Reduced WWOX expression is associated with the basal-like subtype and a relatively poor disease-free survival rate among breast cancer patients. Though several WWOX partners have been identified, the functional mechanisms of WWOX’s role in cancers have not been fully addressed to date. In the current study, we found WWOX suppresses expression of KLF5—an oncogenic transcription factor—at protein level, and suppresses cancer cell proliferation in both bladder and breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that WWOX physically interacts with KLF5 via the former’s WW domains and the latter’s PY motifs. Interestingly, we found the expression of WWOX negatively correlates with KLF5 expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, we conjecture that WWOX may suppress cancer cell proliferation partially by reducing the expression of KLF5.

14844354296	Experimental studies on mechanical behavior of refuse samples	The results from the consolidated undrained triaxial compression tests and the consolidated drained triaxial compression tests on the refuses with various compositions, have shown that the constitutive relation of the tested refuse basically fits the Duncan-Chang nonlinear elastic model. The organic and soil contents of refuses are the important factors that affect the strength parameters of refuses. For the refuse with higher organic and lower soil contents, the lower value of cohesion c and higher value of internal friction angle φ should be adopted. The values of c, φ and their variation are given. The values of c will increase and the values of φ will decrease with the variation of time. Although the value of axial strain of refuse exceeds 30%, the phenomenon of the increase of the principal stress difference is observed. The hysteresis pore water pressures in refuse during the consolidation are analyzed. The variation of the seepage coefficients k is related to the stress, time and the composition of the refuse. The pore water pressures of the refuses will increase with the increase of axial stress during the shear of the consolidation drained triaxial compression tests. The total stress strength parameters are not the effective stress strength parameters.

22344447823	Linear stability analyses of convection in two-layer system with an evaporating gas-liquid interface	Marangoni-Bénard convective instability in a system of two layers consisting of an evaporating liquid layer and its vapor-phase layer, heated from below, is studied by a linear stability theory. Both phase-layers with infinite thickness are placed between two horizontal rigid boundaries while the top boundary wall is assumed as a porous medium through which the vapor phase is passed in a certain velocity. Both the unperturbed temperature profiles and the instability of two-layer convection are presented for a large variation region of the evaporating mass flow rate and different thickness ratio of two layers.

0031317563	Fractal formation in sputtered films of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O7-x on Si substrates	Fractal regions appealing in BSCCO films after annealing have been investigated by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscope. Tie fractal dimensions and fractal density (number of fractals per unit area) are temperature dependent. At lower annealing temperature (450° C) both the morphologies and fractal dimensions closely resemble those arising in two dimensional diffusion-limited-aggregation (DLA) simulations. The observation results show that after annealing at 600° C or higher temperature, the fractal regions changed, even disappeared, which means the growth mechanism is very different from that of traditional DLA. A random diffusion and successive nucleation model has been proposed to explain the results. ©by Allerton Press, Inc.

We define a new evaporation Biot number which is different from that in the one-sided model, and obtain the curves of critical Marangoni number versus wavenuniber.

In this model, the vapour recoil effect on the Marangoni-Bénard instability of a thin evaporating liquid layer can be examined only when the interface deflexion is considered. The instability of a liquid layer undergoing steady evaporation induced by the coupling of vapour recoil effect and the Marangoni effect is analysed using a linear stability theory. We modify and develop the Chebyshev-Tau method to solve the instability problem of a deformable interface system by introducing a new equation at interface boundary. New instability behaviour of the system has been found and the self-amplification mechanism between the evaporation flux and the interface deflexion is discussed. ©2006 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

Both linear instability analysis and nonlinear instability analysis (2D numerical simulation) were performed to study the influence of thermocapillary force on the convective instability of the two-layer system. The results show the strong effects of thermocapillary force at the interface on the time-dependent oscillations at the onset of instability convection. The secondary instability phenomenon found in the real two-layer system of Silicone oil over water could explain the difference in the comparison of the Degen's experimental observation with the previous linear stability analysis results of Renardy et al. © 2006.

33744955851	Analysis on the convective instability of two layer evaporation system	One-sided model is proposed in previous works about the research on the Rayleigh-Marangoni-Bénard instabilities of the evaporating liquid layer. Recently, some investigators proposed two-sided model to analyze the instabilities of evaporating vapor-liquid system, but the relation between evaporation flux and saturate pressure has not been taken into account, hence these results can not reflect the influence of evaporation on the instability of the system. In the present paper, a new two-sided model is proposed and the interface deflection is taken into account. Rayleigh-Marangoni-Bénard instabilities of the two layer system with an evaporating interface are discussed by Linear instability analyses method. The curves of critical Marangoni number versus wavenumber are obtained and the influence of evaporating coefficient and gravity on the instabilities of the system were discussed.

Most study of non-equilibrium is about the metal, alloy and other simple system. The complex silicate system is rarely involved. However, silicate is very important in geosciences and ceramic industry. Two kinds of non-equilibrium crystal morphologies of silicate, namely dendrite of diopside and spherulite of plagioclase, were introduced. Combining with the other kinds of non-equilibrium morphologies, the characteristics of micro-macro and anisotropy-isotropy of the non-equilibrium morphologies were discussed.

33746600330	Linear stability analysis of convection in two-layer system with an evaporating vapor-liquid interface	Classical theories have successfully provided an explanation for convection in a liquid layer heated from below without evaporation. However, these theories are inadequate to account for the convective instabilities in an evaporating liquid layer, especially in the case when it is cooled from below. In the present paper, we study the onset of Marangoni convection in a liquid layer being overlain by a vapor layer. A new two-sided model is put forward instead of the one-sided model in previous studies. Marangoni-Benard instabilities in evaporating liquid thin layers are investigated with a linear instability analysis. We define a new evaporation Biot number, which is different from that in previous studies and discuss the influences of reference evaporating velocity and evaporation Biot number on the vapor-liquid system. At the end, we explain why the instability occurs even when an evaporating liquid layer is cooled from below.

33749465009	Preparation of uniform-sized PLA/PLGA microcapsules containing lysozyme by combining porous glass membrane emulsification and multiple emulsion-solvent evaporation	Relatively uniform-sized biodegradable poly(lactide) (PLA) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microcapsules containing lysozyme were successfully prepared by combining porous glass membrane emulsification technique with multiple emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Compared with the stirring method, it was found that the sizes of microcapsules are more uniform, the coefficient of variation (CV) value which indicates the size distribution was 14.04%. It was found that adding additives to inner aqueous phase could efficiently improve the drug encapsulation efficiency, adjust the drug release profile and maintain the bioactivity of drug. When PVA, PEG400 and HP-β-CD were separately added into the inner aqueous phase, the encapsulation efficiency increased from 68.1% to 86.6%, 89.0% and 94.1% respectively. The cumulative release amount was decreased when PEG400, PEG6000, HP-β-CD were added. While it was enhanced when PVP or PVA was added. It demonstrated that the main reason for protein deactivation was lysozyme adsorption onto the W/O interface. The loss of lysozyme activity was successfully prevented by adding PEG400, PEG6000, HP-β-CD or PVP into the inner aqueous phase.

33846438273	How High Are the P-T Conditions for Paleoproterozoic Metamorphism of the Huangtuling Felsic Granulite, North Dabieshan, Central China?	The 2. 34 cm-wide garnet porphyroblast in the Paleoproterozoic felsic granulite from the Huangtuling area, North Dabieshan, has been reinvestigated for compositional variation in light of Cacomposition X-ray mapping to obtain peak P-T conditions of granulite-facies metamorphism. A new core-rim traverse was conducted through where there is little influence on Ca-profile and slight modification in Mn-, Mg- and Fe-profiles with the highest Mg/(Mg+Fe) value of 0. 467. Reasonable peak P-T conditions were estimated to be 1.50-1.70 GPa and 1 100-1 150 °C according to TWQ-based garnet-Al-orthopyroxene thermobarometry. These estimations suggest that the Huangtuling granulite once was subjected to ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) granulite-facies metamorphism following a high-pressure granulite-faices metamorphic stage, implying that a deep subdaction and collision process relevant to the Yangtze block occurred in the Paleoproterozoic time, probably as a response to the global assembly event of the Columbia supercontinent. © 2006 China University of Geosciences.

It is found that all the crystallites in this aggregation are twinned with one another. The anisotropy of the zigzag pattern is controlled by the twin structure. The twin structure is of 6mm symmetry. This twin structure is related to the crystal point group m3m, so it is proposed that all crystals with point group m3m (and even the similar point groups 432 and m3) have the possibility to form this zigzag pattern. It is illustrated that the crystal symmetry plays an important role in the crystallite aggregation pattern. © International Union of Crystallography 2007.

Important transistor parameters, such as current gain, transconductance, cutoff frequency and maximum oscillation frequency are calculated as a function of Ge concentration in the base under different injection levels. The main physical mechanisms for the current and cutoff frequency rolloff at high injection levels are also analyzed. It shows that the high-level injection effect is more pronounced in the SiGe HBTs as a result of the increasing minority carrier concentration in the base and the Ge concentration and distribution will have a decisive influence of device performance. The results may provide a basis for the design of low temperature operation SiGe HBTs.

We analyzed the significance of these concepts when they embody on real crystal morphologies. That is: the positive and negative forms belong to the same geometric form but two different crystallographic forms, and they can combine together on the same crystal morphology; the left and right forms belong to the same geometric form but two different crystallographic forms, and they cannot combine together on the same crystal morphology because they have different structures; the general and special forms can not only be signified by crystallographic form but also by geometric form. This realization clarified the theoretic and real implication on these old concepts, which had not attracted enough attention of us before, and is important for the development of crystal symmetry theory and teaching.

The variables of the base function are inseparable, but base function is itself anisotropic because of high sensitive to directions. The undecimated ridgelet transform (UDRT) can be considered as application of a 1-D undecimated wavelet transform (UDWT) on the slices of the Radon transform. Because UDWT is translation invariant, the denoising algorithm via soft-thresholding can efficiently suppress the oscillation phenomenon on the poignant changes of the 1-D signal. Therefore, the UDRIFDA can greatly reduce the artifacts in the restored image, the numerical experiment exhibits that the UDRIFDA have the higher signal-to-noise and visual quality than decimated ridgelet transform [1] and 2-D wavelet transform removing noise of a blurred image.

41149130715	Evaporative and convective instability in the two-layer Marangoni-Bënard system of vapor-liquid	The effects of liquid evaporation on the interfacial tension-induced convection and instability are studied theoretically and experimentally in present paper. The main purpose of this investigation is to understand the mechanism of convection instability in a thin vapor-liquid layer with a mass exchange surface (interface) where exists the coupling of evaporation phenomenon and Marangoni-Bénard instability. A systematic model of two-layer system consisting of the evaporating liquid layer and vapor-phase layer, heated from below, is studied by linear instability analysis. The thickness of both layers is finite and each layer has an infinite extension in length. The top wall is assumed as a porous medium pervious to vapor, through which the gas phase is passed in a certain velocity in order to control the evaporation flux and vapor pressure. Deformable vapor-liquid interface in the perturbation state are considered, and the influence on the convection instability of the system are analyzed comparatively. Neutral stability curves of the two-layer system are presented for different cases, such as evaporation coefficient, evaporating mass flux, gravity, etc.

In this paper, the ENVISAT/AATSR (The Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) thermal data are used to estimate the TAWV and LST over the Loess Plateau in China by using a practical split window algorithm. The distribution of the TAWV is accord with that of the MODIS TAWV products, which indicates that the estimation of the total atmospheric water vapor content is reliable. Validations of the LST by comparing with the ground measurements indicate that the maximum absolute derivation, the maximum relative error and the average relative error is 4.0K, 11.8% and 5.0% respectively, which shows that the retrievals are believable; this algorithm can provide a new way to estimate the LST from AATSR data. © 2008 by MDPI.

We analyze the main interferential factors when different deformation modes are corrected. The influence caused by fitting errors is studied in this paper. A preferable result can be obtained after eliminating the interferential factors. The method can obtain useful correction forces.

84896982523	Smart Nanovehicles based on ph-triggered disassembly of supramolecular peptide-amphiphiles for efficient intracellular drug delivery	A novel type of nanovehicle (NV) based on stimuli-responsive supramolecular peptide-amphiphiles (SPAs, dendritic poly (L-lysine) non-covalently linked poly (L-leucine)) is developed for intracellular drug delivery. To determine the pH-dependent mechanism, the supramolecular peptide-amphiphile system (SPAS) is investigated at different pH conditions using a variety of physical and chemical approaches. The pH-triggered disassembly of SPAS can be attributed to the disappearance of non-covalent interactions within SPAs around the isoelectric point of poly (L-leucine). SPAS is found to encapsulate guest molecules at pH 7.4 but release them at pH 6.2. In this way, SPAS is able to act as a smart NV to deliver its target to tumor cells using intracellular pH as a trigger. The DOX-loaded NVs are approximately 150 nm in size. In vitro release profiles and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of HepG2 cells confirm that lower pH conditions can trigger the disassembly of NVs and so achieve pH-dependent intracellular DOX delivery. In vitro cytotoxicity of the DOX-loaded NVs to HepG2 cells demonstrate that the smart NVs enhance the efficacy of hydrophobic DOX. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and CLSM results show that the NVs can enhance the endocytosis of DOX into HepG2 cells considerably and deliver DOX to the nuclei. A smart nanovehicle for use as a novel drug nanocarrier is designed based on a supramolecular peptide-amphiphile system (SPAS). SPAS exists as a well-defined nanostructure at pH 7.4, but the whole SPAS system disassembles at pH 6.2. Because SPAS can encapsulate anticancer drugs at normal physiological conditions, and it can disassemble to release the drug at the pH levels found inside tumor cells. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This is an unstable open flow that exhibits rich dynamics including the formation of droplets, or beads, driven by a Rayleigh-Plateau mechanism modified by the presence of gravity as well as the variation of surface tension induced by temperature disturbance at the interface. A linear stability analysis and a nonlinear simulation are performed to investigate the dynamic of axisymmetric disturbances. The results showed that the Marangoni instability and the Rayleigh-Plateau instability reinforce each other.

Since 1998, the authors and their colleagues extended such a research idea into classification via multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and multiple criteria quadratic programming (MQLP). The purpose of the paper is to share our research results and promote the research interests in the community of computational sciences. These methods are different from statistics, decision tree induction, and neural networks. In this paper, starting from the basics of Multiple Criteria Linear Programming (MCLP), we further discuss penalized MCLP Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP), Multiple Criteria Fuzzy Linear Programming, Multi-Group Multiple Criteria Mathematical Programming, as well as regression method by Multiple Criteria Linear Programming.

47749147774	An optimization-based classification approach with the non-additive measure	Optimization-based classification approaches have well been used for decision making problems, such as classification in data mining. It considers that the contributions from all the attributes for the classification model equals to the joint individual contribution from each attribute. However, the impact from the interactions among attributes is ignored because of linearly or equally aggregation of attributes. Thus, we introduce the generalized Choquet integral with respect to the non-additive measure as the attributes aggregation tool to the optimization-based approaches in classification problem. Also, the boundary for classification is optimized in our proposed model compared with previous optimization-based models. The experimental result of two real life data sets shows the significant improvement of using the non-additive measure in data mining. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The thiazolylazopyrimidine chromophores exhibited large molecular hyperpolarizabilities which were larger than that of a chromophore derived from 4-nitroaniline, owing to the presence of the electron-deficient thiazole ring at the acceptor end of the molecule. Moreover, in comparison with an analogous aniline based chromophore, the thiazolylazopyrimidine chromophores displayed a large blue shift due to the presence of the electron-poor pyrimidine ring at the donor end molecule, resulting in an improvement in optical transparency. The thiazolylazopyrimidine chromophores displayed high thermal stability owing to the presence of the thiazole and pyrimidine rings. Such novel, nonlinear optical thiazolylazopyrimidine chromophores are distinguished by good nonlinearity-transparency-thermal stability trade-off for nonlinear optical application. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The system consists of a fluid layer overlying porous media and is subjected to a horizontal plane Poiseuille flow. We use Brinkman's model instead of Darcy's law to describe the porous layer. The eigenvalue problem is solved by means of a Chebyshev collocation method. We study the influence of the depth ratio d̂ and the Darcy number δ on the instability of the system. We compare systematically the instability of Brinkman's model with the results of Darcy's model. Our results show that no satisfactory agreement between Brinkman's model and Darcy's model is obtained for the instability of a fluid-porous system. We also examine the instability of Darcy's model. A particular comparison with early work is made. We find that a multivalued region may present in the (k,Re) plane, which was neglected in previous work.

60649110243	Analysis of land-surface radiation characteristic in winter-wheat field over the loess plateau mesa in china	Using the field observational data from April to July, 2006, the land surface radiation balance components characteristics during the winter-wheat growth season in different weather conditions over the Loess Plateau Mesa have been analyzed. This paper also focuses on comparison of radiation balance components characteristics over the winter wheat field and the bare soil. The results showed there is a significant variation of the radiant balance in different weather conditions. The land surface upward long wave radiation value is biggest in clear day, cloudy day and rainy day, and it lags behind the global radiation an hour when both of them reach the peak value. On the contrary, the value of atmospheric downward long wave radiation is lowest in the clear day, which is 300 W·m

61349159918	Estimation of summer evapotranspiration using satellite remote sensing data over the Heihe river basin	In this paper, the distribution and total amount of evapotranspiration (ET) is estimated under the diverse landscape over the Heihe river basin in Northwestern China in July 2004 by using MODIS data and meteorological data based on the aerodynamic method and the time upscaling scheme. Taking advantage of the high resolution Landsat-5 TM data, according to the contrastive analysis, we find that the influence of the heterogeneous underlying earth's surface on the estimation of water and heat exchange on the land surface by using the high resolution remote sensing data is obviously smaller than that by using the middle resolution ones. By comparing the estimates of ET with the observation data collected from "JTEX" experiment we conclude that, by using the high resolution data, the parameterization algorithm used in this paper can derive daily ET with a relative error of 10%. After analyzing the distribution of the derived monthly ET over the basin in July 2004, it is concluded that the mountainous area above 2000 m exhibits the ET twice more than that the area fronting mountains below 2000 m elevation; and the oasis and crop area take on an ET 12 times more than that of the desert and Gobi region over the area fronting mountains, and the former is the most significant region that consumes land surface water over the mid-downstream area in summer.

The microstructures of the alloy were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and metallographic microscopy. The results show that by spray deposition and hot pressing technology 70%Si-Al alloy with a diameter of 76.2 mm and a thickness of 6 mm can be obtained. The growth of primary silicon in 70%Si-Al alloy can be inhibited, and its grain size is only 20-50 μm. The distribution of primary silicon forms a continuous framework and the Al phase encircles the interval of Si phase continuously. The increase of thermal conductivity and decrease of the coefficient thermal expansion are mainly because of this structure. Its thermal conductivity reaches up to 110 W/(m·K) at room temperature and the coefficient of thermal expansion is just 9.6×10

62249192128	Effects of magnetic field on current in polymer photovoltaic cell	Polymer photovoltaic cells were fabricated with the basic device structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/P3HT: PCBM/Ca/Al. The magnetic-field-dependent current under illumination and in darkness in these devices were measured respectively under different bias. It was found that the light current was enhanced by the magnetic field whereas the dark current was suppressed. Based on the formation mechanism of the light current and the dark current in polymer solar cell, the observed magnetic field effects were explained. The results show that the magnetic field can effectively change the relative ratio between the singlet and the triplet polaron pairs, resulting in an increase in the density of the free carriers. The concentration augmentation of photo-generated free carriers is responsible for the increase of the photocurrent. On the other hand, the interaction between the free carriers and triplet excitons leads to the decrease of the dark current. Around the open circuit voltage, the magnetic field dependent photocurrent and dark current acting together causes the magnetic field effect of light current. ©2009 Chin. Phys. Soc.

At low temperatures, the magnetic field effects consist of a rapid rising in EL in low field regime followed by a slow falling at high fields and a continuous increase in current for all applied magnetic fields. The high field decrease in the EL is weakened and even vanishes at higher temperatures, which is attributed to the field affected triplet-triplet annihilation process. Other possible mechanisms about the magnetic field effects on electronic processes in OLEDs are also discussed. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

The two layers are separated by a deformable evaporation interface. A linear stability analysis is carried out to study the convective instability during evaporation. In previous works, the interface is assumed to be under equilibrium state. In contrast with previous works, we give up the equilibrium assumption and use Hertz-Knudsen's relation to describe the phase change under non-equilibrium state.

Comparing the result of the retrievals with MODIS total atmospheric water vapor content products, a little difference was found between the AATSR retrievals and MODIS products, but the retrieval of water vapor content is acceptable and can be directly used in deriving atmospheric transmittance. Land surface temperature retrievals are also validated by using the ground measurements, the maximal absolute error is 4. 0 °C, the average relative error is 5. 0%, which indicates that the estimation is successful in the Loess Plateau.

70249119654	Degradation of organic solar cells studied by displacement current	Large displacement current and then apparent external quantum efficiency are observed for 'dead' (no photocurrent under steady-state illumination) organic solar cells under chopped light illumination. This displacement current is generated from charge trapping and detrapping under non-steady-state illumination, reflecting a large number of trap states in the devices. The photocurrent degradation of organic solar cells is suggested to be caused by these traps. Thus a physical degradation process of organic solar cells is proposed: the filled traps would hinder the transport of free carriers from the donor-acceptor interface to the electrodes on the one hand and quench the excitons generated in the active layer on the other hand. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

70349974406	Instabilities of a liquid film flowing down an inclined porous plane	The problem of a film flowing down an inclined porous layer is considered. The fully developed basic flow is driven by gravitation. A careful linear instability analysis is carried out. We use Darcy's law to describe the porous layer and solve the coupling equations of the fluid and the porous medium rather than the decoupled equations of the one-sided model used in previous works. The eigenvalue problem is solved by means of a Chebyshev collocation method. We compare the instability of the two-sided model with the results of the one-sided model. The result reveals a porous mode instability which is completely neglected in previous works. For a falling film on an inclined porous plane there are three instability modes, i.e., the surface mode, the shear mode, and the porous mode. We also study the influences of the depth ratio d, the Darcy number δ, and the Beavers-Joseph coefficient αBJ on the instability of the system. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method is used to simulate the free surface flow of gas-liquid. The process of the liquid propellant reorientation started from initially flat and curved interfaces are numerically studied. These two different initial conditions of the gas-liquid interface result in two modes of liquid flow. It is found that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be reduced evidently at the initial gas-liquid interface with a high curve during the process of liquid reorientation in a low-gravity environment. © 2009 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

75749110205	Actual daily evapotranspiration estimated from MERIS and AATSR data over the Chinese Loess Plateau	The Chinese Loess Plateau is located in the north of China and has a significant impact on the climate and ecosystem evolvement over the East Asian continent. Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) at a regional scale are in crucial need for climate studies, weather forecasts, hydrological surveys, ecological monitoring and water resource management. In this research, the ET of the Chinese Loess Plateau was estimated by using an energy balance approach and data collected during the LOess Plateau land-atmosphere interaction pilot EXperiments 2005 (LOPEX05). With the combined data of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and some other variables such as air temperature, crop height and wind speed, the instantaneous net radiation, sensible heat flux and soil heat flux were calculated; the instantaneous latent heat flux was derived as the residual term of energy balance, and then converted to daily ET value by sunshine duration. The calculated daily ET from the model showed a good match with the measurements of the eddy covariance systems deployed in LOPEX05. The minimum relative error of this approach is 9.0%, the cause of the bias was also explored and discussed. © 2010 Author(s).

The existing TESLA 9-cell cavity geometry data have been used for the initial construction of the models in HFSS. Monopole, dipole and quadrupole modes have been obtained by applying different symmetry boundaries on various cavity models. In calculation, scripting language in HFSS was used to create scripts to automatically calculate the parameters of modes in these cavity models (these scripts are also available in other cavities with different cell numbers and geometric structures). The results calculated automatically are then compared with the values given in the TESLA paper. The optimized cavity model with the minimum error will be taken as the base for further simulation of the SPL cavities. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Ltd.

77953007653	Control of magnetoconductance through modifying the amount of dissociated excited states in tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum-based organic light-emitting diodes	Magnetoconductance (MC) is generally believed to be controlled by the ratio of singlet to triplet excited states. In this study, it is found that the MC magnitude of tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum-based organic light-emitting diodes decreases substantially upon the introduction of narrow band gap fluorescent dopants. Since singlet to triplet ratio of excited states keeps unchanged in doped devices, this large reduction in MC means that other underlying mechanism affects the MC. The charge carrier trapping effect is proposed here to vary the magnitude of MC. By using this trapping effect, the controlling of the total amount of dissociated electron-hole pairs and consequently the magnitude of MC are realized by changing the dopant's concentration or band gaps. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

77955650401	Instabilities and transient behaviors of a liquid film flowing down a porous inclined plane	The nonmodal linear stability of a falling film over a porous inclined plane has been investigated. The base flow is driven by gravity. We use Darcy's law to describe the flow in the porous medium. A simplified one-sided model is used to describe the fluid flow. In this model, the influence of the porous layer on the flow in the film can be identified by a parameter β. The instabilities of a falling film have traditionally been investigated by linearizing the governing equations and testing for unstable eigenvalues of the linearized problem. However, the results of eigenvalue analysis agree poorly in many cases with experiments, especially for shear flows. In the present paper, we have studied the linear stability of three-dimensional disturbances using the nonmodal stability theory. Particular attentions are paid to the transient behavior rather than the long time behavior of eigenmodes predicted by traditional normal mode analysis. The transient behaviors of the response to external excitations and the response to initial conditions are studied by examining the pseudospectral structures and the energy growth function G(t). Before we study the nonmodal stability of the system, we extend the results of long-wave analysis in previous works by examining the linear stabilities for streamwise and spanwise disturbances. Results show that the critical conditions of both the surface mode and the shear mode instabilities are dependent on β for streamwise disturbances. However, the spanwise disturbances have no unstable eigenvalue. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

77956471762	Regional soil moisture retrievals and simulations from assimilation of satellite microwave brightness temperature observations	Low-frequency microwave satellite observations are sensitive to land surface soil moisture (SM). Using satellite microwave brightness temperature observations to improve SM simulations of numerical weather, climate and hydrological predictions is one of the most active research areas of the geoscience community. In this paper, Yan and Jins' (J Radio Sci 19(4):386-392, 2004) theory on the relationship between satellite microwave remote sensing polarization index and SM is used to estimate land surface SM values from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-E (AMSR-E) brightness temperature data. With consideration of soil texture, surface roughness, optical thickness, and the monthly means of NASA AMSR-E SM data products, the regional daily land surface SM values are estimated over the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The resulting SM retrievals are better than the NASA daily AMSR-E SM product. The retrieved SM values are generally lower than the ground measurements from the Maqu Station (33.85°N, 102.57°E) and the Tanglha Station (33.07°N, 91.94°E) and the US NCEP reanalysis data, but the temporal variations of the retrieved SM demonstrate more realistic response to the observed precipitation events. In order to improve the land surface SM simulating ability of the weather research and forecasting model, the retrieved SM was assimilated into the Noah land surface model by the Newtonian relaxation (NR) method. A direct insertion method was also applied for comparison. The results indicate that fine-tuning the quality factor in the NR method improves the simulated SM values most for desert areas, followed by grasslands, and shrub and grass mixed zones at the regional scale. At the temporal scale, the NR method decreased the root mean square error between the simulated SM and actual observed SM by 0.03 and 0.07 m

78649286187	Tests on shear strength behavior and envelop of double lines of municipal solid waste	The triaxial and direct shear tests are the main methods to study strength behavior of municipal solid waste. By use of triaxial tests and direct shear tests on artificial solid waste, standard sand with textile and remolded municipal solid waste from field, the stress strain curves exhibit steady hardening and saw waving after certain strain is reached. Through the analysis of the existing test results in China, it is found that the dry density of solid waste is the key influence factor of strength and has good relation with the strength behavior. The results show that envelop of solid waste can be simulated by double lines, and that the cohesion and friction angle are dependent upon whether or not the solid waste is rolled. The shear strength of solid waste by direct shear tests is between that by CU triaxial tests and that by CD triaxial tests and is closer to that by CU triaxial tests. The direct shear tests are more accurate in simulating friction behavior between blocks of solid waste feasible to determine the strength parameters of solid waste. The failure shear strain in the triaxail tests and the displacement in the direct shear tests are suggested.

78751494553	An optimization-based classification approach with the non-additive measure	Optimization-based classification approaches have been used widely for decision making problems, such as classification in data mining. Usually they assume that the contribution of attributes towards the classification equals to the sum of contributions from each individual attributes. Because of linearly or equally aggregation of attributes taken in these approaches, the impact from interactions among attributes is ignored. However, in reality, attributes are frequentlyinterrelated to each other, and any unreasonable assumption or simplification would compromise classification accuracy and robustness. To remedy this problem, in this paper, we introduce the generalized Choquet integral with respect to the non-additive measure as the attributes aggregation tool for optimization-based classification. Moreover, unlike previously proposed optimization-based models, in our approach, the boundary b for classification is also optimized. Experimental results have shown significant improvement of using the non-additive measure in classification.

We focus on the effects of vertical and horizontal vibrations on the stability of different convection modes. The results show that vertical vibrations significantly stabilize the system, while horizontal vibrations significantly destabilize it. In the presence of vertical vibrations, instability only occurs in a system heated from below. However, in the presence of horizontal vibrations, instability can also occur in a system cooled from below. When Marangoni effect is dominant at the interface, it is found that there are four types of coupling modes. The oscillatory convection is the result of the competition between different modes. In the presence of Marangoni effect at the interface, the structure of the interfacial flow is complicated. In some cases, small counter-rolls may develop to preserve the nonslip condition of fluids in either the upper layer or the lower layer. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The results showed the sizes of both blank nanoparticles and drug-loaded nanoparticles in pH 7.4 were smaller than those of nanoparticles in pH 5.0, and the mean diameter of drug-loaded nanoparticles was much bigger than that of blank nanoparticles. The PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The release profile showed that the release of DOX in pH 5.0 was much faster than that in pH 7.4. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles was preferable to free doxorubicin.

79959255406	Non-modal instability in plane Couette flow of a power-law fluid	In this paper, we study the linear stability of a plane Couette flow of a power-law fluid. The influence of shear-thinning effect on the stability is investigated using the classical eigenvalue analysis, the energy method and the non-modal stability theory. For the plane Couette flow, there is no stratification of viscosity. Thus, for the stability problem the stress tensor is anisotropic aligned with the strain rate perturbation. The results of the eigenvalue analysis and the energy method show that the shear-thinning effect is destabilizing. We focus on the effect of non-Newtonian viscosity on the transition from laminar flow towards turbulence in the framework of non-modal stability theory. Response to external excitations and initial conditions has been studied by examining the Î-pseudospectrum and the transient energy growth. For both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, it is found that there can be a rather large transient growth even though the linear operator of the Couette flow has no unstable eigenvalue. The results show that shear-thinning significantly increases the amplitude of response to external excitations and initial conditions. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.

79960855100	Aerial lidar data classification using weighted support vector machines	This paper presents our research on classifying scattered 3D aerial Lidar height data into ground, vegetable (trees) and man-made object (buildings) using Support Vector Machine algorithm. To this end, the most basic theory of SVM is first outlined and with concern to the fact that features are differed in their contribution to classification, Weighted Support Vector Machine (W-SVM) technique is proposed. Second, four features consist of height, height variation, plane fitting error and Lidar return intensity are identified for classification purposes. In this step, features are normalized respectively and their weight that indicates feature's contribution to certain class or multi-class as a whole are calculated and specified. Third, Based on W-SVM technique, one 1AAA1 solution to multi-class classification is proposed by integration "one against one" and "one against all" solution together. Finally, the classification results of LIDAR data with presented technique clearly demonstrate higher classification accuracy and valuable conclusions are given as well. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

80051565362	Effect of the basin-fill features on oil shale formation in Paleogene, Huadian Basin	On the basis of sequence straigraphy, three third-order sequences was divided in western basin, and oil shale occured in transgressive system tract and high stand system tract. Considering the characters of tectonic evolution, in the initial subsiding stage and the atrophic stage, Huadian Basin was filled with shallow water, and mainly develope alluvial fan, persistent fan-delta and shallow lake deposits, and the depth and scale of semi-deep and deep lacustrine dark mudstone were small. In the maximum subsidence stage, Huadian Basin was deep and stable. The intermittent fan-delt was deposited in the northeast part of this basin. The depth and scale of semi-deep and deep lacustrine dark mudstone reached to its maximum amount. Dozens of high-quality oil shale layers was deposited in this stage. Based on the distribution features of strata thickness, sedimentary facies, thickness of and oil yeild of oil shale, oil shale with the most high-quality and the maximum thickness was not deposited in the maximum depth water without sandbody, but was deposited in the deep water where was near the basin margin and without fan-delta. The interbedded of semi-deep lake and fan-delta front sediments brought nutrients into water, which caused high productivity of lake. During the deposition of semi-deep lake, the reduction deep water is the best place to preserve and get organic enrichment, then forme high-quality oil shale.

80054697833	Application of geological analogy to assess oil shale resources of depression basin: an example from Upper Cretaceous Songliao Basin	The geological analogy was employed to evaluate the oil shale resources, in order to improve the prediction precision in middle-low exploration basin.Main geological parameters of controlling the generation and enrichment of oil shale was optimized in terms of the development characteristics of oil shale and its metallogeny and enrichment mechanisms in the Songliao depression basin.Moreover, these geological parameters were quantified through the qualitative binary status approach to calculate analogical coefficients and its distribution function of predicting area.Finally, combination of sampling from Monte-carlo method was used to estimate oil shale resources of predicting area.The results show that oil shale resources of Songliao Basin is 7.712 3~2 281.014 2 gigaton during the whole probability interval, the oil shale resources from the first 'National Oil Shale Evaluation' matches 65% of probability from above estimation.In contrast, that from direct square method matches 61% of probability, which is slight higher than the former.Therefore, the geological analogy is a promising approach to evaluate oil shale resources of middle-low exploration basin, and it can bring the estimate with successful hold.

Using the same synthesis route, a Gemini nonylphenol polyoxyethylene surfactant (GNP) was synthesized using an industrial nonylphenol product and paraformaldehyde, and its molecular structure was also characterized by 1H-NMR and FTIR spectra. The optimal reaction conditions were established. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) values of GAP were determined by means of Wilhelmy plate method and steady-state fluorescence probe method. The experimental results show how the lengths of the hydrophilic polyoxyethylene chain and the hydrophobic tail alter the CMC values. The CMC values of the GAP are found to be much lower than those of corresponding conventional single tail nonionic surfactants of the polyethoxylated alkylphenol type, which indicates that the gemini species exhibit a better surface activity. © AOCS 2011.

84755160935	Non-modal instabilities of two-dimensional disturbances in plane Couette flow of a power-law fluid	Instabilities of fluid flows have traditionally been investigated by normal mode analysis, i.e. by linearizing the equations of flow and testing for unstable eigenvalues of the linearized problem. However, the results of eigenvalue analysis agree poorly in many cases with experiments, especially for shear flows. In this paper we study the instabilities of two-dimensional Couette flow of a polymeric fluid in the framework of non-modal stability theory rather than normal mode analysis. A power-law model is used to describe the polymeric liquid. We focus on the response to external excitations and initial conditions by examining the pseudospectra structures and the transient energy growths. For both Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows, the results show that there can be a rather large transient growth even though the linear operator of Couette flow has no unstable eigenvalue. The effects of non-Newtonian viscosity on the transient behaviors are examined in this study. The results show that the "shear-thinning/shear-thickening" effect increases/decreases the amplitude of responses to external excitations and initial conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

84855207501	Palaeoclimatic evolution during Eocene and its influence on oil shale mineralisation, Fushun basin, China	The Fushun basin is a small, explored, coal and oil shale-bearing, Cenozoic fault basin in the Liaoning Province, northeast China. The basin mainly consists of Eocene swamp to lacustrine deposits of the Guchengzi to Xilutian Formation, and contains the biggest opencast oil shale mine in Asia. This mine has provided an ideal opportunity to undertake palaeoclimate reconstruction in this basin based on a single geological profile and the analyses of 93 samples, using various approaches, namely field geological observation, clay mineralogical and geochemical (Sr/Ba, Sr/Cu, stable C and O isotope) analyses, all of which were compared with palaeobotanical data. The Eocene climate of Fushun basin evolved from warm temperate to north subtropical, and generally changed from warm humid to subhumid-semiarid. Paleoclimatic and geochemical parameters shows that the very warm and humid climate during Jijuntun Formation increased the initial productivity of lake water, and caused a steady stratification of the lake water, then caused oxygen lack in the bottom of water. Productivity of the lake provides the mean origin of organic matters for oil shale formation, and steady anoxic environment is beneficial for the conservation of organic matters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84857184822	Classification for orange varieties using Near Infrared spectroscopy	A reduced classification model is developed in order to discriminate the three orange varieties (i.e., Kaew Wan, Number One, and Sai Nam Pung). A diversity of classification methods, including kNN, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LGR), Multi-Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were first evaluated on the complete data. The 10-fold cross-validation results demonstrate that the best performing model- LGR reaches 100% classification accuracy with all the 255 Near Infrared NIR spectrum features. From these 255 features, a subsequent feature selection identified four spectra of good discriminative ability. Based on these four NIR spectrum features, a reduced LGR is developed and its classification accuracy is as high as 95%. This finding suggests that the oranges can be classified with satisfying accuracy by measuring only four NIR spectra instead of all the 255 ones. © 2011 IEEE.

84860279214	Deposition and sedimentary evolution of coal, oil shale and evaporite-bearing strata in terrestrial basins	The stratigraphic units in terrestrial basins commonly reveal some recurrent rules during sedimentary evolution, which characterize progressive evolution of sedimentary facies (lithofacies) associations, architecture, packing types, and paleontological assembles, corresponding to the potential deposit of economic coal, oil shale, and evaporite. We practically distinguished the varieties of stratigraphic units and bearing economic resource deposit during filling process from the Fushun basin, Liaoning Province, the Tongbai basin, Henan Province, and the Greater Green River basin, US via the illustrative names of coal, oil shale and evaporite-bearing stratigraphic units. Moreover, of which sedimentary evolution is controlled by integrated tectonic and climate. Tectonic and climate control the potential accumulation of terrestrial basins and eventual sediment plus water inflow into terrestrial basins, changing the basin filling status among over-compensation, balance-compensation, and under-compensation, eventually causing the alteration of lithological associations, sedimentary architecture and paleontological assembles of different stratigraphic units, which can reasonably interpret potential deposit of coal, oil shale and evaporite. Furthermore, different tectonic and climate factors in various basins may result in the absent of coal, oil shale or evaporite.

Clay minerals of Huadian formation of the study area contain montmorillonite, kaolinite and illite. The content of montmorillonite is the highest, and illite/smectite mixed layer is rare. Mn, Sr, P, Cd, Sr/Cu, B/Ga, Sr/Ba and Ca/(Ca+Fe) change with an exactly similar trend vertically, and Cu, Cs, Rb/Sr, V/(V+Ni) and δCe change with another similar trend. Clay minerals and inorganic geochemical evidence reveal the characteristics of paleoclimate and paleolimnology: the upper section containing coal and the lower section containing pyrite of Huadian formation belong to terrestrial sedimentary environment under the condition of warm and humid climate and low salinity; the middle section containing oil shale belongs to frequently alternating freshwater and saltwater environment, alternating humid and drought climate. The largest expansion phase of lacustrine basin which was under reduction condition with alternating humid and drought climate and salinity stratification developed semi-deep lake and deep lake facies which formed oil shale; the shrinkage phase of lacustrine basin with warm and humid climate developed delta plain with peat swamp which formed coal.

84862506630	Quantitative evaluation of oil shale based on well log and 3-D seismic technique in the Songliao Basin, Northeast China	The quantitative evaluation of the Upper Cretaceous oil shale has been conducted by abundant testing, log and seismic data from the Songliao Basin in Northeast China. Based on the log-seismic characteristics of oil shale, the technique of log-seismic multi-attributes reconstruction to evaluate single-well oil shale has been adopted. By using the method of log-constrained seismic inversion, the inversion volume of wave impedance, total organic carbon (TOC), and oil yield have been obtained to carry out evaluation of oil shale. According to the evaluation results, the inversion of wave impedance can only be used for qualitative evaluation of the spatial distribution of oil shale. Meanwhile, the inversion of TOC and oil yield can be used not only to evaluate the spatial distribution of oil shale, but also for quantitative evaluation of the quality of oil shale. Hence, the evaluation technique of oil shale was developed combining single-well log evaluation and spatial seismic evaluation, which integrates the quantitative evaluation of oil shale with geophysical technique. © 2012 Estonian Academy Publishers.

84861978066	Eocene sedimentary evolution and its control over coal & oil shale development in Fushun Coalfield	Eocene sedimentary evolution and its control over development of coal and oil shale in Fushun Coalfield were investigated through out-crop measurement, deposit character analysis, facies reconstruction, as well as pollen assemble and geochemistry data comparison. The results indicate that the sedimentary evolution started from fan delta and swamp facies associations of the Guchengzi formation, then underwent shallow lake and semi-profundal to profundal facies associations of Jijuntun formation, eventually evoluted into cycle deposit of the Xilutian formation. Coal seam of Guchengzi formation was deposited in fresh-water swamp with increasing river inflow under warm and humid climate. However, oil shale of Jijuntun formation was deposited in saline semi-profundal to profundal lake with decreasing river inflow under relatively cold and arid climate. Lean oil shale as transitional layer from coal to rich oil shale implies organic input of aquatic organism together with high plant. Sedimentary environment changes of coal and oil shale cause variation of organic origin and water condition, resulting in "hydrogen-enrichment" and increasing hydrocarbon potential of coal deposit associated with oil shale in Fushun Coalfield.

The average values Sr/Cu, Rb/Sr, Sr/Ba, B/Ga in poor ore and rich ore segments of Jijuntun Formation are 2.30, 0.63, 0.20, 1.07 and 3.41, 0.43, 0.34, 1.50 separately. The contents of Rb, Sr, Cu, Ba, Ga, B and those ratios indicate that in study aera Jijuntun Formation formed in warm, humid climatic conditions and fresh water environment. The average values of Sr/Cu, Rb/Sr, Sr/Ba and B/G are 24.63, 0.14, 1.25 and 3.90 respectively, and these ratios and the contents of Rb, Sr, Cu, Ba, Ga, B indicate Xiloutian Formation formed in dry, hot climatic conditions and simisaline-saline water environment. Correlation between Sr/Cu, Rb/Sr and Sr/Ba and carbon and oxygen isotope in carbonate rock of Xilutian Formation indicate that the paleoclimate is the main factor which controls the palaeosalinity and paleo-lake is closed type during the upper segment of Jijuntun Formation and Xiloutian Formation. The oil shale formed in warm, humid climatic conditions and fresh water depositional environment. Warm, humid climatic conditions and closed type paleo-lake are beneficial for the forming of high grade oil shale.

For ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays, the uniform CdSe and CdTe nanoshells were composed of zinc-blende phase nanocrystals with a respective average size range of 10-20 nm and 7-15 nm, and formed a compact and continuous interface in between. Based on the band offset of the bulk material before contact and the interfacial Fermi level shift after contact, the energy level alignments at the CdSe/CdTe and CdTe/CdSe interface were deduced for the double-shelled nanocable arrays. The CdTe/CdSe interface of the ZnO/CdTe/CdSe nanocables has a negative band offset of -0.16 eV whilst for ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocables, the band edge of CdTe lies above CdSe with a conduction band offset of 0.16 eV at the CdSe/CdTe interface. Such a stepwise band alignment, together with the compact interface, fewer grain boundaries along the radial direction, and the fast transfer rate along the axial direction of the nanocables, makes the ZnO/CdSe/CdTe nanocable arrays photoanode have a saturated photocurrent of ∼14.3 mA cm

The liquid layer is bounded by a rigid wall from below, and phase change can occur at the interface. The flow of the vapor phase is driven by a constant pressure gradient in the streamwise direction. We have taken into account the effects of buoyancy, thermocapillarity, evaporation, and the dynamics of the vapor phase. A full linear stability analysis is performed using a Chebyshev spectral method. The influences of evaporation effect and the interfacial shear on the Rayleigh instability and the Marangoni instability have been studied.

It is typically used to set up the low-level RF system for particle accelerators. The proposed detector employs the principle of a heterodyne receiver and uses the digital IF architecture with a high oversampling rate to increase the SNR. A discrete Fourier transform-based quadrature demodulator is used to suppress the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization noise and IF harmonics. The system has been evaluated at an IF of 1 MHz and in an RF range of 500-3000 MHz. A graphical user interface is developed to display and record the measured values. The detection accuracy achieved on 500-MHz signals in a 250-kHz bandwidth is better than ±0.0051% for the amplitude and better than ±0.0032° for the phase. Experimental results at different frequencies prove that the detection system can meet the demands of state-of-the-art RF control systems for modern particle accelerators. © 2012 IEEE.

Hydrophobic cinnamic acid was immobilized on methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) via L-lysine as linker to prepare amphiphilic mPEG. The monoend-functionalized mPEG self-assembled micelles in aqueous solution. The size and size distribution of the micelles were tested by dynamic laser scattering (DLS). The morphology of the micelles was observed by SEM, TEM and AFM. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) was tested and it was 42.5 mg/L. The monodisperse micelles had core-shell structure and the mean diameter was around 40 nanometers. α-cyclodextrins were added in the suspension of micelles to form supramolecular hydrogel with the polypseudorotaxanes complexation.

84863313419	Nonmodal stability in Hagen-Poiseuille flow of a shear thinning fluid	Linear stability in Hagen-Poiseuille flow of a shear-thinning fluid is considered. The non-Newtonian viscosity is described by the Carreau rheological law. The effects of shear thinning on the stability are investigated using the energy method and the nonmodal stability theory. The energy analysis shows that the nonaxisymmetric disturbance with the azimuthal wave number m=1 has the lowest critical energy Reynolds number for both the Newtonian and shear-thinning cases. With the increase of shear thinning, the critical energy Reynolds number decreases for both the axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric cases. For the nonmodal stability, we focus on two problems: response to external excitations and response to initial conditions. The former is studied by examining the ε pseudospectrum, and the latter by examining the energy growth function G(t). For both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids, it is found that there can be a rather large transient growth even though the linear operator of the Hagen-Poiseuille flow has no unstable eigenvalue. For the problem of response to external excitations, the optimal response is achieved by disturbance with m=1 for both the Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases. For the problem of response to initial conditions, the optimal disturbance is in the form of streamwise uniform streaks. Being different from the Newtonian case, the azimuthal wave number of the optimal disturbance may be greater than 1 for strongly shear-thinning cases. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84868659354	Metallogenic regularity of oil shale in continental Basin: Case study in the meso-cenozoic basins of Northeast China	As an important replacement or supplement energy for traditional oil & gas, the position of oil shale in global strategy becomes more and more obvious.. In order to reveal the characteristics and distribution regularity of oil shale in continental basins better, based on the summary of exploration results of oil shale for many years, the deposit and metallogenic characteristics of typical oil shale bearing basins such as Songliao and Huadian basin in Northeast China have been analyzed, and the metallogenic regularity of oil shale in continental depression and fault basins has been revealed.. It is shown that oil shale mainly developed in HST and TST within the third order sequence.. Paleoclimate and sedimentary environment play important control action on oil shale formation in large scale depression basin, warm and humid climate greatly improves the lake productivity, which provides abundant materials for oil shale formation.. The distribution of oil shale changes regularly by the evolution of the lake, oil shale mainly deposit in semi-deep to deep lake, high salinity causes the salinity stratification of the lake water, which is benefit for organic preservation.. Tectonic conditions play a vital control action on oil shale mineralization in small fault basins, which affect the thickness distribution and quality characteristics of oil shale by controlling the accommodation.. The accumulation belts of oil shale locate in semi-deep to deep lake close to basin-controlling contemporaneous fault, and oil shale obviously thicken and the oil yield increase near by the side of fault.. Meanwhile, the altering wet and dry climate controls the number of layers and the preservation conditions.. Comparative analysis indicates that the scale of depression oil shale bearing basin is large, oil shale exists alone, the distribution area is large, and characterized by thin-middle layer and low-middle oil yield.. The scale of fault oil shale bearing basin is small, oil shale exists alone or associated with coal, and characterized by thin layer and high oil yield or thick layer and middle oil yield.. During the period of HST and TST within third-order sequence, the organic matter abundance and lake productivity are higher, the stratiform and texture algae are relatively prosperous, exogenous input is relatively low, the water salinity is higher, the reducibility is stronger and the environment is alkalinity, which are the favorable periods for oil shale formation.. Therefore, the abundant organic matter and favorable lake salinity stratification that are comprehensively controlled by paleostructure, paleoclimate and sedimentary environment are restrictive factors for the organic matter enrichment of oil shale.

84869791710	Non-modal stability in sliding Couette flow	The problem of an incompressible flow between two coaxial cylinders with radii a and b subjected to a sliding motion of the inner cylinder in the axial direction is considered. The energy stability and the non-modal stability have been investigated for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disturbances. For the non-modal stability, we focus on two problems: response to external excitations and response to initial conditions. The former is studied by examining the epsilon -pseudospectrum, and the latter by examining the energy growth function G(t)$. Unlike the results of the modal analysis in which the stability of sliding Couette flow is determined by axisymmetric disturbances, the energy analysis shows that a non-axisymmetric disturbance has a critical energy Reynolds number for all radius ratios η = a/b. The results for non-modal stability show that rather large transient growth occurs over a wide range of azimuthal wavenumber $n$ and streamwise wavenumber \ensuremathα even though the Reynolds number is far below its critical value. For the problem of response to external excitations, the response is sensitive to low-frequency external excitations. For all values of the radius ratio, the maximum response is achieved by non-axisymmetric and streamwise-independent disturbances when the frequency of external forcing ω = 0. For the problem of response to initial conditions, the optimal disturbance is in the form of helical streaks at low Reynolds numbers. With the increase of R, the optimal disturbance becomes very close to straight streaks. For each η, the maximum energy growth of streamwise-independent disturbances is of the order of Re

Structural stress calculated using element type solid95 is larger than that of solid45. For fine and medium mesh model, structural stress calculated by Haibach method is larger than other methods, which means a lower fatigue life. Structural stress calculated by Yamada method is lower than other methods, which means a higher fatigue life than that calculated by other methods. For coarse mesh model, structure stress calculated by quadratic extrapolation method is larger than other methods, and, structural stress calculated by Yamada method is much lower than other methods. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Cinnamic-acid-modified poly(ethylene glycol) chains were threaded in α-cyclodextrins to form polyrotaxanes. The polyrotaxanes self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles. The morphology of the nanoparticles was changed from nanovesicle to micelle after the antitumor drug, doxorubicin, was loaded. The release profile of the drug-loaded nanoparticles was investigated, and it was found that the sustaining release time could last for 32 hours. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were co-cultured with mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells with a drug concentration of 10 μg/mL; the cell survival rate was 3.3% after a 72-hour incubation. In an in vivo study of breast cancer in a mouse model, the drug-loaded nanoparticles were injected in the tail veins of mice with a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. The tumor inhibition rate of drug-loaded nanoparticles was 53%, which was better than that of doxorubicin hydrochloride.

84870339518	Effects of pH-sensitive chain length on release of doxorubicin from mPEG-b-PH-b-PLLA nanoparticles	Background: Two methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-histidine)-poly(L-lactide) (mPEG-PH-PLLA) triblock copolymers with different poly(L-histidine) chain lengths were synthesized. The morphology and biocompatibility of these self-assembled nanoparticles was investigated. Methods: Doxorubicin, an antitumor drug, was trapped in the nanoparticles to explore their drug-release behavior. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were incubated with HepG2 cells to evaluate their antitumor efficacy in vitro. The effects of poly(L-histidine) chain length on the properties, drug-release behavior, and antitumor efficiency of the nanoparticles were investigated. Results: The nanoparticles were pH-sensitive. The mean diameters of the two types of mPEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticle were less than 200 nm when the pH values were 5.0 and 7.4. The nanoparticles were nontoxic to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The release of doxorubicin at pH 5.0 was much faster than that at pH 7.4. The release rate of mPEG

84870389775	Effect of pixel scale on evapotranspiration estimation by remote sensing over oasis areas in north-western China	One of the major uncertainties in the remote sensing estimates of regional evapotranspiration (ET) over heterogeneous landscapes is that significant estimation differences between different data scales always exist. It is necessary to predetermine the optimal remote sensing scale under such conditions. In this study, the effect of pixel scale on ET estimation over a typical oasis in north-western China was investigated. By the area-averaging and wavelet multi-resolution analysis aggregation techniques, four "input" up-scaling and "output" up-scaling procedures were implemented, respectively, to determine the optimal data scale. Validation suggested that high-resolution Landsat-based ET estimates could be used as the ground reference data when in situ measurements were not available. The differences between Landsat-based and MODIS-based ET estimates (i. e. the so-called Regional Error Distribution of the latter) showed that 1-km resolution MODIS data overestimated ET over the landscapes where NDVI was less than or equal to ~0. 10; the data underestimated ET over the landscapes where NDVI was greater than or equal to ~0. 40; ET could only be relatively accurately predicted by the data on the surfaces where NDVI ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 40. However, MODIS-based 1-km ET estimates could effectively reveal the predominant spatial distribution trend of regional ET. The results confirmed that the optimal remote sensing scale for modeling ET was approximately 480 m over the study area; land surface heterogeneity could cause significant errors in ET estimation once data scales exceeded this threshold; in addition, MODIS data at 250-m resolution were adequate for correcting the 1-km resolution ET estimates over heterogeneous landscapes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84871677392	Organic matter accumulation in the oil shale- and coal-bearing Huadian Basin (Eocene; NE China)	The Huadian Basin, located in northeastern China, is a fault-controlled basin filled by Eocene non-marine sediments assigned to the Huadian Formation. The formation is subdivided from bottom to top into three members: Pyrite Member, Oil Shale Member, and Carbonaceous Shale Member. Using bulk geochemical data from borehole Hd3 and core descriptions from a high number of wells, the factors controlling organic matter accumulation have been evaluated.The organic matter content of the Pyrite Member is relatively low (average TOC: 0.9. wt.%). Mudstones deposited in shallow lacustrine environments contain between 1 and 2. wt.% TOC (max. 6. wt.%) and a kerogen Type II (HI 400-600. mg HC/g TOC). An arid climate prevented the accumulation of thick coal.The overlying Oil Shale Member contains 13 oil shale layers, which are mined underground. The Oil Shale Member has been interpreted as a 3rd order sequence. Significant differences exist between oil shales deposited in different systems tracts: 2-m-thick coaly oil shale of low-quality (oil yield 3.5. wt.%) developed in the lowstand systems tract. Oil shale, up to 7. m thick, of moderate quality (oil yield 4.1-8.0. wt.%) was deposited during the transgressive systems tract (TST). Thinner (< 3. m) high quality oil shale (oil yield 6.4-19.8. wt.%) is found in the highstand systems tract (HST) and at the base of the regressive systems tract. The lateral extent of the oil shale layers reaches a maximum in the upper TST and the lower HST. The high number of oil shale layers deposited in an overall deep lacustrine environment notifies frequent changes in base level, controlled by tectonic movements, short-term climatic cycles, or cycles in organic matter production.The Carbonaceous Shale Member representing the balanced-fill to overfilled stage of basin evolution hosts economic coal seams, which are occasionally accompanied by shallow lacustrine shales with abundant hydrogen-rich organic matter. Otherwise non-coal layers are typically low in organic matter (average TOC: 0.9. wt.%).In contrast to the Huadian Basin, a very thick coal seam overlain by a single oil shale layer more than 100. m thick developed in the Eocene Fushun Basin. This indicates major differences in the evolution of basins with similar tectonic setting and age. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84872379502	Synthesis and surface activity properties of cationic surfactants of gemini nonylphenol polyoxyethylene quaternary ammonium chloride	A series of cationic surfactants of gemini nonylphenol polyoxyethylene quaternary ammonium chloride (GNPQA) were synthesized and structurally confirmed by 1H NNR, FT-IR and elemental analysis. The influences of reaction conditions on conversion ratio have been investigated, and the optimal conditions were obtained as follows: the reaction time was 12 h, the reaction temperature was 70°C, n(GNP):n(TEA):n(EPI)=1:1:1 (molar ratio). Surface activity properties and micelle aggregation numbers (N) of the GNPQA were determined by a surface tension method and a steady-state fluorescence probe method. The experimental results showed that critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the GNPQA was 1~2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of cationic surfactant of nonylphenol polyoxyethylene quaternary ammonium chloride (NPQA), which has exhibited predominant surface activity of the GNPQA. The N value increased linearly with the increase of the GNPQA concentration in the range of 5~9 times of CMC; CMC and N of the GNPQA decreased with increasing the oxyethylene (EO) unit amount. The micropolarities of surface activities and micelle aggregates of the GNPQA were inferred by the change of surface properties and N values.

84872402933	An alternative approach for the classification of orange varieties based on near infrared spectroscopy	A multivariate technique and feasibility of using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for non-destructive discriminating Thai orange varieties were studied in this paper. Short-wavelength near infrared (SW-NIR) spectra in region of 643 to 970. nm were collected from 100 orange sample of each varieties. A total of 300 spectra were used to develop an accurate classification model by diversity of classifiers. The result showed that Logistic Regression (LGR) model was achieved 100% classification accuracy while Multi-Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) ones also demonstrated satisfying result (95%). In order to find simpler and easier interpretable classification model, several feature selection techniques were evaluated to identify the most relevant wavelengths to the orange varieties. With four principal components (PCs) from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the effective wavelengths of 769.68, 692.28, 662.61 and 959.31. nm from Least Square Forward Selection (LS-FS), the reduced classification models of LGR also achieved satisfying classification accuracy respectively. Furthermore, both Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Kernel Least Square Forward Selection (KLS-FS) with SVM enhanced performance of models by 5 PCs and features respectively. The result concluded that NIRS can yield an accurate classification for Thai tangerine varieties from whole spectra and can enhance interpretability of classification model by feature subset. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The six branches of a snowflake-shaped dendrite in the plane (0001) are along 110. From the orientation determination, a twin relationship and a topotactic relationship between dendrites were found. The twin axes are [011], [011] and [210], and the twin planes perpendicular to the twin axes are (1212) and (1212). From the reticular theory of twinning, it was calculated that the twin index n = 2 and the obliquity ω = 3.2877°. The studied dendrite is a twin by reticular pseudomerohedry with low twin index and obliquity. In the topotactic growth, no twin elements have been found, but the three main crystallographic directions 001, 210 and 110 of the two dendritic crystals overlap each other. The degree of lattice coincidence between the two crystals in this topotactic growth is also discussed. © 2013 International Union of Crystallography.

84873257913	Re-discussion on the four division scheme about continental sequence stratigraphy and its application on oil and gas exploration	Utilizing the practical study on the continental basins, the authors divide the whole third-order sequence into four systems tracts, which are lowstand systems tract (LST), transgressive systems tract (TST), highstand systems tract (HST) and regressive systems tract (RST), named sequence type I. If LST is undeveloped in a third-order sequence, it forms the assemblages of TST, HST and RST, named sequence type II. LST occurred in the rapid declining period of lake level (base level). TST appeared with first lake flooding surface and maximum lake flooding surface. HST formed in the relative static high lake-level period. RST formed in the gradual lake-level fall stage, and the supplying rate of sediments was more than the increasing rate of accommodation space at that time. Generally, LST consists of small scale progradational parasequence sets, vertically, the sedimentary environment is shallower, and river downcutting forms in the basin margin. TST consists of retrogradational parasequence sets, and the sedimentary environment becomes deeper from bottom to up. HST consists of aggradational parasequence sets, and the sedimentary environment changes little or is in standing water. RST consists of large scale progradational parasequence sets, and the sedimentary environment becomes shallower from bottom to up. Finally, the practical study on Songliao basin has been introduced to respectively expound the distribution regularities of oil and gas reservoirs in different system tracts in depression basin and fault basin. LST develops mainly lens-shaped lithologic reservoirs in the steep slope side of fault basin and deep-water area of depression basin. TST forms mainly updip thin away type lithologic oil & gas reservoirs in steep slope belt of fault basin, and forms stratigraphic overlap lithologic oil & gas reservoirs in the gentle slope belt of fault basin and slope zone of depression basin. HST mainly consists of lens-shaped lithologic reservoirs in deep-water area. RST develops mainly stratigraphic unconformity screened oil and gas reservoirs in fault basin, and developes fault block reservoirs and fault screened oil & gas reservoirs in depression basin. Thus, in the combination of theory and the practice, the practicality of the four division about continental sequence stratigraphy has been illustrated.

84873260334	Aerial LiDAR data classification using weighted support vector machines	This paper presents our research on classifying scattered 3D aerial LiDAR height data into ground, vegetable (trees) and man-made object (buildings) using improved Support Vector Machine algorithm. To this end, the most basic theory of SVM is first outlined and with the fact that features are differed in their contribution to identify certain class or classes simultaneously, Weighted Support Vector Machine (W-SVM) technique is developed for maximizing the "recognition" capacity of SVM features in classifying scattered 3D LiDAR height data. Second, we give a proof that the implement of W-SVM is equal to the features normalization multiplied by one weight that indicates feature's contribution to certain class or multi-class as a whole. The weight calculation for each feature is discussed as well. Third, Based on W-SVM technique, one 1AAA1 solution to multi-class classification is proposed by integration "one against one" and "one against all" solution together. Finally, the experiment of classifying LiDAR data with presented technique is presented and shows encouraging improvement classification accuracy, compared to tradition SVM technique. Valuable conclusions are given as well.

84876524758	Influence of chloride salt type on critical chloride content of reinforcement corrosion in concrete	The objective of this study is to examine the influence of chloride salt type on the critical chloride content for the corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete. The experiment was carried out in Portland cement concrete and concrete incorporating fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag. Sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) were chosen to corrode the steel reinforcement. The initiation of pitting corrosion was detected by half-cell potential, linear polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectra methods. The critical chloride content was expressed as free chloride or total chloride by mass of binder, as well as [Cl2]/[OH2]. In addition, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry analyses were employed to study the products in concrete. Test results show that the chloride salt type has a marked influence on the critical chloride content. The critical chloride contents expressed as free Cl2 for the specimens contaminated by external magnesium chloride and calcium chloride are lower than those for the specimens contaminated by external sodium chloride and potassium chloride. Contrary to the trend for free Cl2, the critical chloride contents expressed as total Cl2 and [Cl2]/[OH2] for the specimens contaminated by external magnesium chloride and calcium chloride are higher than those for the specimens contaminated by external sodium chloride and potassium chloride. The concrete specimens contaminated by external sodium chloride have the same critical chloride content as those contaminated by external potassium chloride, regardless of the water-binder ratio, mineral admixtures, or the form of critical chloride content.

84879426209	Effect of mutual location and the shape of heaters on the stability of thin films flowing over locally heated surfaces	We consider the motion of a liquid film falling down a locally heated planar substrate. Marangoni effect due to the local temperature gradients at the free surface induces a three dimensional interfacial deformation near the vicinity of the heater. The objective of the present paper is to study the influence of streamwise arrangement of the heaters of rectangular shape or with infinite spanwise lengths on the structure of interfacial deformation and the stability of the film. The problem is studied in the framework of longwave theory. We studied the influence of mutual location of heaters on the steady state of the film. As the film is heated by heaters with infinite/finite spanwise lengths, 2D/3D steady states exist. A linear stability analysis is performed with respected to both the 2D and 3D basic state. The results show that the mutual location of heater plays an important role in the stability and transient behavior of the film for 2D steady state. However, the 3D steady state of a film heated by rectangular heaters is linear stable. This means that the 3D steady state is a coherent structure in films heated by rectangular heaters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84880088185	Viscous liquid films on a porous vertical cylinder: Dynamics and stability	In this paper, liquid films flowing down a porous vertical cylinder were investigated by an integral boundary layer model. Linear stability and nonlinear evolution were studied. Linear stability results of the integral boundary layer model were in good agreement with the linearized Navier-Stokes equations which indicated that the permeability of the porous medium enhanced the instability of the flow system. The growth rate and cut-off wave number increased with increasing the permeability and the Reynolds number. Linear stability analysis showed that the system was more unstable for a larger Reynolds number Re. Nonlinear studies showed that, for a very small Re, the film evolved with time while a saturated state was not observed. In addition, it was observed that the film ruptured when the permeability parameter β > 0, and the rupture time decreased with increasing β. However, for a moderate Reynolds number, a small finite harmonic disturbance evolved to a saturated traveling wave. Further investigation was conducted on the droplet-like wave solution. Results showed that the wave speed increased as the permeability parameter increased. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84882746380	Oil yield and bulk geochemical parameters of oil shales from the Songliao and Huadian Basins, China: A grade classification approach	Oil shale evaluation is based on oil yield by low-temperature carbonization, which is an extremely complex process. The TOC, semi-coke content, gas loss, bulk density, S2 and HI correlate well with oil yield. The organic matter in the oil shale from the Songliao Basin, China, is of lacustrine origin, while that in the oil shale from the Huadian Basin, China, stems from different sources. Comparative studies show that the simple organic matter composition of the Songliao oil shale facilitates industrial oil shale grade classification on the basis of TOC content only. Complex mixtures of organic matter found in the Huadian oil shale require, in addition to the TOC content, also the S2 and HI for grade classification. Knowing organic matter quality and the deduced oil yield conversion factor enables the industrial grade classification of oil shale on the basis of TOC content. © 2013 Estonian Academy Publishers.

84883495051	Evaluation on root-deck fatigue of orthotropic steel bridge deck	Orthotropic steel decks are widely used in cable-supported bridges. The fatigue cracks in trough-deck welded joints have been detected in some bridges in China. In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) is applied to evaluate fatigue durability of the root-deck fatigue in the trough-deck welded joints over the diaphragms. The reference stress is defined and the mesh size of a shell model is checked. Stress ranges under wheel loads are analyzed, and the pavement-deck interaction is discussed. The durability of the root-deck fatigue is evaluated. Results of this study show that the reference stress defined in the shell model is not sensitive to mesh size. Equivalent stress ranges of multi-axles are close to that of a single axle with multi-cycles. Traffic flow can be simplified as an axle fatigue load model with equivalent fatigue damage. Stress range regardless of the pavement-deck interaction is over estimated and the pavement-deck interaction should be considered in the stress range analysis, especially in thin decks. The predicted life of the root-deck fatigue considering the pavement-deck interaction seems to explain the fatigue cracks of bridges in China. The durability of the root-deck fatigue will be improved if steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) pavement is applied. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84884943004	Net radiation estimated from the FY-2D data over the source region of the yellow river	Numerous studies have developed algorithms for estimating the net radiation by satellite remote sensing data obtained under clear sky conditions using polar orbiting meteorological satellite. However, estimating net radiation under cloudy sky conditions using geostationary meteorological satellites with remote sensing sensors remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we developed algorithms to estimate net radiation through the day under all cloud covered conditions using the data from the visible and infrared spin scan radiometer, which is onboard the Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite. The geostationary sensor can be utilized to regularly generate temporally consistent top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and the temperature of brightness blackbody, both at hourly scales because of its frequent temporal sampling (at 1 hour interval). Under the clear sky condition, FengYun-2D (FY-2D) data are used to derive the hourly net radiation. For cloudy case, the transmission coefficient is calculated using TOA reflectance and the attenuation of solar radiation in the atmosphere. Then, amounts of solar radiation under different atmospheric and cloud covered conditions are recorded. The methodology is applied over the source of the Yellow River on September 2009. Compared with ground-based measurements, the root mean square errors of the net radiation estimated under clear and cloudy conditions using the FY-2D data are 27.0W·m-2 and 38.0W·m-2, respectively. The proposed methodology can rely exclusively on remote sensing data in the absence of ancillary ground observations; thus, it can potentially estimate the surface energy budget regionally. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

The results show that: the source rock of the Guchengzi formation is characterized by totally >10% TOC (Total Organic Carbon) and <5% saturated hydrocarbon, and the bio-marker features (e.g., Pr+Ph content and Hopane/Sterane ratio) are consistent with organic input original from high plant with fresh water; Laminated oil shale and Gammacerane occurrence of the Jijuntun formation indicate the deepening and salination of basin lake water, thus, the increased aquatic organic matter and stable water stratification result in medium to high TOC and elevated saturated hydrocarbon content; the source rock of the Xilutian formation has intensively variable TOC (ranging from 0.23% to 16.91%) and inherited character of soluble organic component, furthermore, abundant β-Carotane implies that the organic matter result from algae deposited in shallow and saline lake. Therefore, the change of deposition environment caused the variation of organic matter origin and primary productivity rate, whether the saline water stratification or not controlled the preservation of deposited organic matter, and deposition cycle (short-scale base level lift) resulted in the vertical change of organic matter abundance.

84887016828	Spatial distance join based feature selection	A Spatial Distance Join (SDJ) based feature selection method (SDJ-FS) is developed to extend the concept of Correlation Fractal Dimension (CFD) to handle both feature relevance and redundancy jointly for supervised feature selection problems. The Pair-count Exponents (PCEs) for the SDJ between different classes and that of the entire dataset (i.e.; the CFD of the dataset) are proposed respectively as feature relevance and redundancy measures. For the SDJ-FS method, an efficient divide-count approach of backward elimination property is designed for the calculation of the SDJ based feature quality (relevance and redundancy) measures. The extensive evaluations on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the capability of SDJ-FS in identification of feature subsets of high relevance and low redundancy, along with the favorable performance of SDJ-FS over other reference feature selection methods (including those based on CFD). The success of SDJ-FS shows that, SDJ provides a good framework for the extension of CFD to supervised feature selection problems and offers a new view point for feature selection researches. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the influence of the elastic modulus, thickness and Poisson ratio of pavement on the stress amplitude of deck detail was discussed. The FEM of steel deck and deck detail were established, and the pavement was considered. The boundary conditions of the FEM of deck detail were interpolated from the FEM of steel deck, and the accurate stress amplitude of deck detail was calculated. The results show that the transverse local effect of deck detail is obviously. The wheel load diffusion and stiffness reinforcement of bridge deck pavement can decrease the local stress of deck detail, and reduce fatigue damage of steel deck effectively. The stress amplitude of deck detail do not reduced obviously with the increase of Poisson ratio. In practical engineering, the fatigue stress can be reduced by increasing the pavement's elastic modulus and thickness for the steel deck with thin top plate.

84896051781	Design and evaluation of a pre-traveling wave deflector magnetic solenoid lens focused streak image tube	Owing to the excellent feature of ultrahigh temporal resolution, the streak image tube has been the indispensable scientific instrument for the application to measurement of ultrafast phenomena on subpicosecond time scale. In this paper, a new femtosecond streak image tube with both high temporal and spatial resolution is designed. To improve its integrated performance, a pair of traveling wave deflectors is located before a magnetic solenoid lens in the tube, which minimizes the electron transit time from anode to deflection plates and therefore reduces time dispersion and space charge effects. Using CST microwave studio finite element method, bandwidth and deflection sensitivity of traveling wave deflector have been studied numerically. The result shows that the wide bandwidth of the traveling wave deflectors designed is beneficial to slow down the electrical deflecting pulse to match the beam velocity in a wide frequency range, which can improve the deflection sensitivity. After tracing the trajectory of electrons and calculating the modulation transform function, we get temporal resolution of 220 fs and spatial resolution above 100 lp/mm. Based on the aberration theory, the aberration formulas of electron trajectory are deduced, which systematically evaluate the imaging quality of streak image tube with modulation transfer function. Finally, static experiment is carried out, and the result shows that the static spatial resolution is better than 35 lp/mm. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society.

Based on mineralogy, inorganic and organic geochemistry, organic petrography, stable isotope geochemistry, and vitrinite reflectance measurements, the depositional environment and the oil shale potential of the oil shale-bearing succession were investigated. The Jijuntun Formation is subdivided into a lower and an upper unit characterized by a low and high quality oil shale, respectively. The thick oil shale layer of the Jijuntun Formation developed under long-lasting stable conditions in a deep freshwater lake, after drowning of a swamp. The organic matter in the lower unit is characterized by landplant-derived macerals. The sediments containing a type II kerogen (HI: ~400mgHC/gTOC) were deposited during warm and humid conditions. Lacustrine organisms predominant in the upper unit are forming kerogen type I (HI: ~700mgHC/gTOC). High bioproductivity and excellent preservation conditions resulted in high TOC contents up to 23.6wt.% in the upper unit. The organic matter preservation was controlled by photic zone anoxia originating in a temperature stratified water column in the deep lake, without significant changes in bottom water salinity. Mid-Eocene cooling during deposition of the upper unit of the Jijuntun Formation is reflected by clay mineral composition. A hot and arid climate favoring brackish conditions in a shallow lake prevailed during accumulation of the overlying carbonate-rich Xilutian Formation. Individual geochemical parameters in the Fushun Basin have to be used with caution, e.g. the maturity proxy T

84904150705	Analysis and calculation for compensation force in axial support system in 1.2 m primary mirror optical fabrication	Dealing with some non -rotational symmetrical residual error in low -frequency Zernike polynomials surface is needed in the manufacture of large-reflecting mirror. These errors greatly increase the difficulty of processing. Propose to change the mirror surface for reducing the fabrication difficulty by active support technique. Study the method of compensating some non -rotational symmetrical residual error in low-frequency Zernike polynomials surface by active support technique. Firstly, apply the all - floating support method in axial support system to control the deformation of the mirror's surface. Then, apply force as the control variable in the system. Do the "correction" process on the solution which can not satisfy the principles of "Resultant equal to zero" and "Total torque equal to zero". Successfully achieve the compensation of low-frequency Zernike coefficient surface by active support technique. The results of simulation by Ansys-Workbench software prove the feasible.

84905051286	Precise integration method of pseudo-dynamic testing of structures	Based on nonlinear precise integration method, two new numerical integration methods of pseudo-dynamic test of structures are presented. One is explicit predict-correct, four order accuracy and multistep method avoiding calculating the inversion of the state matrix. The other is implicit predict-correct, four order accuracy and multistep method that need calculate the inversion of the state matrix. Since their accuracies are superior to the central difference method by enlarging time step and their stabilities are better, the structural systems of multi-degree of freedom could be well tested and the testing work would be largely reduced. Finally, a pseudo-dynamic test of combined tube structure has been executed with the explicit multi-step method. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84905057649	Land-atmospheric water and energy cycle of winter wheat, Loess Plateau, China	Surface energy partitioning and the characteristics of the water and energy cycle provide important information for improving land surface and weather forecast modelling. In this study, the land-atmospheric water and energy cycle of winter wheat was investigated on Loess Plateau in the northwest of China, using the eddy covariance technique, soil heat flux, and four component radiation measurements during the period from 8 April 2006 to 15 July 2006. Results show that the four components underwent daily changes throughout the period, and varied diurnally according to the synoptic conditions. Latent heat flux was the main consumer of available energy during the studied period. The daily energy partitionings LE/Rn, Hs/Rn and G0/Rn were on average 45%, 34% and 10%, respectively, and the Bowen ratio is estimated at 0.90. Surface albedo of winter wheat field was on average 0.19, over the total period from 8 April to 15 July, but decreased at the time of the heading of the wheat as compared to other seasons because of increased vegetation cover. The energy closure results show that the energy balance closure reached 89% through a thermal storage term of soil correction, which indicates that an energy imbalance of 11% was encountered in our observations. The daily variations in the water and energy fluxes were also analysed, including the diurnal variations on cloudy and clear sky days. Results show that the available sensible as well as latent heat flux both changed daily. The latent heat flux was primarily controlled by antecedent precipitation, with several high latent heat flux days being produced after intensive rain events. The sensible heat flux was mainly controlled by net radiation. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.

84918520983	Comparative studies on the interactions of dihydroartemisinin and artemisinin with bovine serum albumin using spectroscopic methods	The interactions of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and artemisinin (ART) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) have been investigated using fluorescence, UV/vis absorption and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra under simulated physiological conditions. The binding characteristics of DHA/ART and BSA were determined by fluorescence emission and resonance light scattering (RLS) spectra. The quenching mechanism between BSA and DHA/ART is static. The binding constants and binding sites of DHA/ART-BSA systems were calculated at different temperatures (293, 298, 304 and 310 K). According to Förster non-radiative energy transfer theory, the binding distance of BSA to DHA/ART was calculated to be 1.54/1.65nm. The effect of DHA/ART on the secondary structure of BSA was analyzed using UV/vis absorption, FTIR, synchronous fluorescence and 3D fluorescence spectra. In addition, the effects of common ions on the binding constants of BSA-DHA and BSA-ART systems were also discussed.
