1542302642	Possibility of using periodic structure permanent magnetic ring as initial energy source for a magneto-cumulative generator	In a lot of single-shot applications and experiments at remote locations where magneto-cumulative generator provide the most practical pulse power, it is impracticable to use a capacitor bank as the initial energy source. V. V. Gdovnina et al has used a permanent magnet ring as the initial energy source to drive a magneto-cumulative generator, but the energy density stored in a single permanent magnet ring is very low. In this paper, the possibility of using periodic structure permanent magnetic rings as initial energy source of magneto-cumulative generator is analyzed theoretically. It is concluded that 1 kJ initial energy can be provided to magneto-cumulative generator by the periodic structure permanent magnetic ring whose mass is less than 30 kg and the outside radius less than 60 cm, and some relative technical problems are also considered.

25444475258	Progress in persistence dynamics of insecticidal proteins released from Bt crops in cropland	This paper reviews the progress in persistence dynamics of insecticidal proteins released from Bt crops in soil, and mainly summarizes: 1) the detection methods for Bt toxin proteins released from transgenic Bt crops in soil; 2) the persistence, accumulation and degradation of Bt toxin in soil; 3) the mechanism by which Bt toxin proteins absorb and bind with the surface-active soil particles; 4) the insecticidal activity of Bt toxin proteins in cropland soil. Many studies showed that Bt toxin proteins could rapidly be absorbed and tightly bound with the surface-active soil particles, which decreased biotic degradation, but the bound toxins structures did not change, so that the Bt toxin proteins released by transgenic crops could persist in soil for long time and retain their insecticidal activity. This part of Bt toxins might probably be harmful to non-target entities/organisms in soil. So this situation needs to undertake an immediate study in a systemic way to assess the ecological risks caused by Bt toxin proteins released by transgenic crops.

33646495798	Conceptual design of a periodic permanent magnetic ring magnetic flux compression generator	In a lot of single-shot applications and experiments at remote locations where magnetic flux compression generator (MFCG) provides the most practicable power, it is impracticable or inconvenient to use a capacitor bank to be the initial energy source. Godovnina, V.V. et al have used a homogenous permanent magnet as the initial energy source to drive MFCG, but the energy density stored in a single permanent magnet is very low. The possibility of using periodic permanent magnetic ring structure to be the initial energy source of an MFCG was analyzed theoretically and numerically. It was concluded that about 1 kJ initial energy can be provided to an MFCG by the periodic-ring permanent magnetic ring which weights less than 30 kg and the outside radius less than 30 cm. In this paper, an axially detonated MFCG with a two-period alternating PPM ring. Structure is provided, and its current amplification expression is reduced. Meanwhile some numerical examples for such an MFCG are also provided. For NaFeB, the axially detonated PPM ring MFCG can output current over 150 kA. It is concluded that an experimental investigation of such an MFCG design is worthwhile.

33745762532	Gene cloning and expression of cadherin in midgut of Helicoverpa armigera and its Cry1A binding region	Cadherins belong to one of the families of animal glycoproteins responsible for calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Recent literatures showed that the cadherin-like in midgut of several insects served as the receptor of Bt toxin Cry1A and the variation of cadherin-like is related to insect's resistance to Cry1A. The full-length cDNA encoding cadherin-like of Helicoverpa armigera is cloned by degenerate PCR and RACE techniques and the gene was designated as BtR-harm, which is 5581 bp in full-length, encoding 1730 amino acid residues (BtR-harm was deposited in GenBank and the accession number is AF519180). Its predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point were 195.39 kDa and 4.23, respectively. The inferred amino acid sequence includes a signal sequence, 11 cadherin repeats, a membrane-proximal region, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic region. Sequence analysis indicated that the deduced protein sequence was most similar to the cadherin-like from Heliothis virescens with 84.2% identity and highly similar to three other lepidopteran cadherin from Bombyx mori, Manduca sexta and Pectinophora gossypiella, with the sequence identities of 60.3.6%, 57.5% and 51.0%, respectively. The cDNA encoding cadherin gene was expressed successfully in E. coli and the recombinant proteins can bind with Cry1Ac. Truncation analysis and binding experiment of BtR-harm revealed that the Cry1A binding region was a contiguous 244-amino acid sequence, which located between amino acid 1217 and 1461. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that BtR-harm was highly expressed in midgut of H. armigera, very low expressed in foregut and hindgut and was not expressed in other tissues. After H. armigera producing resistance to Cry1Ac, the expression quantity of BtR-harm significantly decreased in midgut of H. armigera. It is the first confirmation that BtR-harm can function as receptor of Cry1Ac in H. armigera and the binding region was located on a contiguous 244 amino acid sequence, suggesting that the decrease of expression quantity of BtR-harm is one of the main reasons for H. armigera resistance to Cry1Ac.

34248364859	New computational method of driving thrust and lift force for EMS maglev vehicle	Considering the alveolus discontinuous distribution of stator and rotor in salient pole synchronous motor applied to electromagnetic suspension (EMS) maglev train, a novel analytical computation method of thrust force and levitation force was put forward. Based on the geometrical and the load distributions of stator and rotor at the running position of the train in the method, all thrust forces were computed according to stator magnetomotive force and the magnetic field strength distributions of the train position. All levitation forces of the running train were obtained according to the distributions of overall magnetic conductance function and current charge curve for stator and rotor. The results show that the fluctuating frequencies of driving thrust and lift force are six times that of the stator current frequency. When rotor polar distances are bigger than stator polar distances, driving thrust and lift force become larger and fluctuations of driving thrust and lift force become relatively less.

The influence of the magnetic pressure on the radial velocity and the expanding process of the armature were particularly analyzed. The simulation results show that during most time of the magnetic flux compression process, the radial velocity of the expanding armature is determined by detonation pressure, but with the current increase the effects of magnetic pressure become more and more important, which should be considered in designing the second stage of the HMFCG.

38349061552	The N-terminus of PrP is responsible for interacting with tubulin and fCJD related PrP mutants possess stronger inhibitive effect on microtubule assembly in vitro	Microtubule dynamics is essential for many vital cellular processes such as in intracellular transport, metabolism, and cell division. Some evidences demonstrate that PrP may associate with microtubular cytoskeleton and its major component, tubulin. In the present study, the molecular interaction between PrP and tubulin was confirmed using pull-down assays, immunoprecipitation and ELISA. The interacting regions within PrP with tubulin were mapped in the N-terminus of PrP spanning residues 23-50 and 51-91. PrP octapeptide repeats are critical for the binding activity with tubulin, that the binding activity of PrP with tubulin became stronger along with the number of the octapeptide repeats increased. Microtubule assembly assays, sedimental tests and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the full-length PrP (aa 23-231) obviously inhibited the microtubule polymerization processes in vitro, whereas the N- (aa 23-91) and C- (aa 91-231) terminal peptides of PrP did not affect microtubule polymerization. Moreover, the familial Cruetzfeldt Jacob disease (fCJD) related PrP mutants with inserted or deleted octapeptide repeats showed much stronger inhibitive capacities on the microtubule dynamics in vitro than wild-type PrP. Our data highlight a potential role of PrP in regulating the microtubule dynamics in neurons. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84876562423	Identification and Characterization of Pheromone Receptors and Interplay between Receptors and Pheromone Binding Proteins in the Diamondback Moth, Plutella xyllostella	Moths depend on olfactory cues such as sex pheromones to find and recognize mating partners. Pheromone receptors (PRs) and Pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) are thought to be associated with olfactory signal transduction of pheromonal compounds in peripheral olfactory reception. Here six candidate pheromone receptor genes in the diamondback moth, Plutella xyllostella were identified and cloned. All of the six candidate PR genes display male-biased expression, which is a typical characteristic of pheromone receptors. In the Xenopus-based functional study and in situ hybridization, PxylOR4 is defined as another pheromone receptor in addition to the previously characterized PxylOR1. In the study of interaction between PRs and PBPs, PxylPBPs could increase the sensitivity of the complex expressing oocyte cells to the ligand pheromone component while decreasing the sensitivity to pheromone analogs. We deduce that activating pheromone receptors in olfactory receptor neurons requires some role of PBPs to pheromone/PBP complex. If the chemical signal is not the pheromone component, but instead, a pheromone analog with a similar structure, the complex would have a decreased ability to activate downstream pheromone receptors. © 2013 Sun et al.

We found that marilin-2 is widely distributed in the connective tissues of many mouse tissues including heart, colon, penis, esophagus, lung, kidney, tracheal cartilage, developmental bone, and adult bone. The expression level of matrilin-2 was remarkably increased in the tissues of osteoarthritis developmental articular cartilage, compared to normal healthy tissues. Furthermore, we determined matrilin-2 expression in specific epithelial cells in stomach and ductal epithelial cells of salivary gland. In other tissues, the positive signals were mainly located around cardiac muscle cells and Purkinje fibers in the heart; corpus spongiosum in the penis; submucosa in the colon and esophagus; extracellular matrix of cartilage in the tracheal cartilage; and, glomerulus, the basement membrane of distal convoluted tubule and renal matrix in kidney. These observations indicated that the distribution pattern of matrilin-2 is heterogeneous in each tissue. Matrilin-2 may play an important role in the communication of matrix to matrix and matrix to cells and will be used as a potential biomarker in the early stage of osteoarthritis of articular cartilage. © 2014 Shukun Zhang et al.

44049090260	Expression of Aminopeptidase N1 (APN1), the Main Receptor Protein for Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A Toxin from Helicoverpa armigera Larval Midgut in Trichoplusia ni cells	The aim of this article is to successfully express the Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxin receptor protein located on the internal membrane of larval midgut of cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hübner) within eukaryotic expression system, which is one of the key links for clarifying the relationship between receptor and Bt resistance. The fragments of aminopeptidase N1 (APN1) gene without signal peptide in the susceptible and the resistant H. armigera were cloned separately using PCR method, and were separately cloned into pUC 19 vector. After sequencing the gene, the fragments encoding for APN1 without signal peptide were cloned into the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system with transfer vector pFastBacHTB under the polyhedron gene promoter. The recombinant transposing plasmid pFastBacHTB/APN1 was screened and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH10Bac. It was cultured in LB medium, which contained Te, Kan, Ge, X-gal, and IPTG. The resulting recombinant bacmid was transfected into cells of the insect Trichoplusia ni and recombinant baculoviruse was obtained. The lysate of cells infected with recombinant baculoviruse was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blot analysis. The results showed that the recombinant baculoviruse was fully capable of expressing APN1. The APN1 gene successfully expressed in T. ni cell established the base for continuing the research on its function and relationship of resistance with Bt. © 2008 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

44449167972	Different expression patterns of CK2 subunits in the brains of experimental animals and patients with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies	To address the possible alteration of casein kinase 2 (CK2) in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), the levels and patterns of CK2 in the brain tissues of hamsters or C57BL mice inoculated intracerebrally with scrapie agents 263K or 139A were evaluated by Western blots, followed by quantitative analysis. Specific semi-quantitative RT-PCR for evaluating the mRNA transcripts of CK2 subunits was performed in parallel. Compared with normal animals, the levels of CK2α and CK2β in the brains of infected hamsters and mice were significantly decreased, regardless of which scrapie agent was. However, the expression of CK2α′ or CK2α′/ CK2α″ in the animals infected with agents 263K or 139A was considerably increased. Furthermore, decreases of CK2α and CK2β and increases of CK2α′/CK2α″ were observed in cerebella homogenates from one familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD) case and one fatal familial insomnia (FFI) case. These results suggest that alterations of CK2 subunits in brains are illness-correlative phenomena in TSEs and indicate a potential linkage of CK2 changes with the pathogenesis of prion diseases. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

The results showed that the optimum pH values of total protease in the both strains were 10.5. The optimum pH values of active alkaline trypsin-like enzyme in the two strains were 10.5 except that of the third instar larvae of resistant H. armigera was 8.0, while the optimum pH values of weak alkaline trypsin-like enzyme in the strains were 8.0. However, the optimum pH values of chymotrypsin-like enzyme in the two strains were 8.5 except that of the fifth instar larvae of resistant H. armigera was 8.0. The activities of mid-gut protease in both resistant and susceptible strains under the optimum pH condition were also compared. There was no significant difference in the activities of total midgut protease of the two strains. It was shown that the activities of active alkaline trypsin-like enzyme in the fifth instar larvae of the two strains were not significantly different, while those of the third instar larvae of the two strains were significantly different. It was also found that there was no difference in the weak alkaline trypsin-like enzyme activities of the third instar larvae between the two strains, and those of the fifth instar of the two strains were significantly different. As for chymotrypsin-like enzyme, it was found that there was a significant difference in the activities of the two strains. It was concluded that the changes in pH values and mid-gut protease activities could bring out resistance evolution of H armigera larvae to Btinsecticidal proteins.

57849157424	Casein kinase II interacts with prion protein in vitro and forms complex with native prion protein in vivo	The most essential and crucial step during the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy is the conformational change of cellular prion protein to pathologic isoform. Casein kinase II (CK2) is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic protein kinase that is essential for viability. To explore the possible molecular interaction between CK2 and prion protein (PrP), the full-length sequences of human CK2α and CK2β complementary DNA were amplified with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the total messenger RNA from cell line SH-SY5Y as the template; then, the fusion proteins histidine-CK2α and glutathione S-transferase-histidine-CK2β were expressed in Escherichia coli. The interaction between CK2 and PrP was evaluated with co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. The results demonstrated that recombinant PrP bound specifically with CK2α, but not with CK2β. The native CK2 and PrP in hamster brains interacted with each other, forming protein complexes. Three different glycosylated forms of PrP (diglycosylated, monoglycosylated and unglycosylated PrP) from normal brains interacted with the CK2α subunit, though the unglycosylated PrP seemed to have a stronger binding ability with CK2α subunit. The domain responsible for interacting with CK2α was located at the C-terminal segment of PrP (residues 91-231). This study proposed reliable experimental data for the molecular interaction between PrP and CK2α (both in recombinant and native categories), scientific clues for further assessing the potential biological significance of the PrP-CK2 interaction, and the possible role of CK2 in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. © 2008 Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

We used cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis to identify those genes differentially expressed in the Cry1Ac-resistant and -susceptible strains, which revealed 212 differentially expressed transcripts among 2000 screened cDNAs. Among these transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), 37 showed some homology to known sequences, including Aminopeptidase N (APN), which is expressed in the midgut epithelium and has been implicated as a Cry1A subfamily receptor in several moths, including H. armigera. We confirmed the TDF by RT-PCR and identified a deletion mutation of apn1 in the Bt-R strain. We expressed the TDF in bacteria. The partial HaAPN1-96S wild-type protein, bound to Cry1Ac on ligand blots, whereas HaAPN1-BtR did not. This suggested that HaAPN1 is a receptor for Bt Cry1Ac and that its deletion mutation is associated with Cry1Ac resistance in H. armigera. The absence of one binding site is responsible for its resistance to Cry1Ac. We developed an allele-specific PCR to monitor whether the apn1 gene in an H. armigera field population produced a similar mutation. No deleted mutants were found in 2250 individuals collected from the field in 2006-2007. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To investigate the possible mechanism of neurotoxicity due to accumulation of PrP in cytosol, a PrP mutant lacking the signal and GPI (CytoPrP) was introduced into the SH-SY5Y cell. MTT and trypan blue assays indicated that the viability of cells expressing CytoPrP was remarkably reduced after treatment of MG-132. Obvious apoptosis phenomena were detected in the cells accumulated with CytoPrP, including loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increase of caspase-3 activity, more annexin V/PI-double positive-stained cells and reduced Bcl-2 level. Moreover, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL assays also revealed clear evidences of late apoptosis in the cells accumulated CytoPrP. These data suggest that the accumulation of CytoPrP in cytoplasm may trigger cell apoptosis, in which mitochondrial relative apoptosis pathway seems to play critical role.

70350600613	Manganese-induced changes of the biochemical characteristics of the recombinant wild-type and mutant PrPs	Manganese may play some roles in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. In this study, recombinant human wild-type (WT) PrP and PrP mutants with deleted or inserted octarepeats were exposed to manganese, and their biochemical and biophysical characteristics were evaluated by proteinase K (PK) digestion, sedimentation experiments, transmission electron microscopy and circular dichroism. It demonstrated that incubation of manganese remarkably increased PK-resistances, protein aggregations and β-sheet contents of the PrPs. Moreover, the PrP mutants of inserted or deleted octarepeats were much vulnerable to the influence of manganese, which showed obviously more aggregation and higher β-sheet content than that of WT-PrP. It highlights that the effect of manganese on the PrP seems to lie on the incorrectness of the octarepeats numbers. The association of the octarepeats number of PrP with manganese may further provide insight into the unresolved biological function of PrP in the neurons. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

70350614263	Preparation of coal fly ash based forming adsorbent and its adsorptive properties for methylene blue	In order to increase the reaction activity of fly ash, the raw fly ash (RFA) was ball milled and ultra-fine fly ash (UFA) was obtained. The UFA was reacted with NaOH solution, after reaction the mixture was extruded and dried, the ultra-fine forming fly ash-based adsorbent (UFFA) was gained. The three adsorbents were characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope.The adsorptive capacities of RFA, UFA and UFFA for methylene blue (MB) were studied. The results show that the capacity of UFFA is superior to the others. The kinetics of MB on three adsorbents fitted second order kinetic model and the adsorption processes on UFFA are controlled by intra-particle diffusion. The MB adsorption equilibrium on UFFA can be described in terms of Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption thermodynamic parameters free energy (ΔG) of MB is negative and enthalpy (ΔH) is -13.84 kJ/mol which indicates the adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic.

0035493983	Simulation of mercury injection-withdrawal process in porous material using a network model	A simple cubic random network model in which pore sizes obey Lognormal distribution was set up to describe the pore structure of porous material, and the mercury injection-withdrawal process was simulated, then the effects of network coordination number, pore size distribution, pore chamber size and pore throat size etc. were investigated. The simulation results showed that the main factors that affect the shape of mercury injection-withdrawal curves were the standard deviation of the pore size distribution and the coordination number of network model. It appears that the temporary entrapment of mercury was due to bigger pores shielding smaller pores and the permanent entrapment of mercury was due to smaller pores shielding bigger pores.

In this study, chitosan-based thermosensitive hydrogels were prepared, characterized and the biocompatibility for culturing mice bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) on 2D films and within 3D hydrogel were investigated. The gelation temperature and biocompatibility could be modulated by addition hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) to chitosan-glycerophosphate (CH-GP) formulation. The CH-GP-HEC liquid solution can turn into gel at body temperature and has highly compatible with BMSC. Therefore, the CH-GP-HEC gel could be used as an attractive injected in-situ forming scaffold for future applications of delivering biologically active therapeutics for tissue engineering filed.

77950538707	Changes of tau profiles in brains of the hamsters infected with scrapie strains 263 K or 139 A possibly associated with the alteration of phosphate kinases	Background: Phospho-tau deposition has been described in a rare genetic human prion disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, but is not common neuropathological picture for other human and animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). This study investigated the possible changes of tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau, at Ser396, Ser404, and Ser202/Thr205) in scrapie experimental animals.Methods: The profiles of tau and p-tau (p-tau, at Ser396, Ser404, and Ser202/Thr205) in the brain tissues of agents 263K- or 139A-infected hamsters were evaluated by Western blots and real-time PCR. Meanwhile, the transcriptional and expressive levels of GSK3β and CDK5 in the brains were tested.Results: The contents of total tau and p-tau at Ser202/Thr205 increased, but p-tau at Ser396 and Ser404 decreased at the terminal stages, regardless of scrapie strains. Transcriptional levels of two tau isoforms were also increased. Additionally, it showed higher CDK5, but lower GSK3β transcriptional and expressive levels in the brains of scrapie-infected animals. Analysis of brain samples collected from different times after inoculated with agent 263 K revealed that the changes of tau profiles and phosphate kinases were time-relative events.Conclusion: These data suggest that changes of profiles of p-tau at Ser396, Ser404 and Ser202/Thr205 are illness-correlative phenomena in TSEs, which may arise of the alteration of phosphate kinases. Alteration of tau, p-tau (Ser396, Ser404, and Ser202/Thr205), GSK3β and CDK5 were either intermediate or consequent events in TSE pathogenesis and proposed the potential linkage of these bioactive proteins with the pathogenesis of prion diseases. © 2010 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77951727154	Polymorphisms in the surfactant protein a gene are associated with the susceptibility to recurrent urinary tract infection in Chinese women	Some risk factors for susceptibility to recurrent urinary tract infection (r-UTI) are well known, but the genetic role in acquiring the disease is poorly understood. Surfactant protein A and D (SP-A and SP-D) play an important role in modulation of lung inflammatory processes. The SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes encoding SP-A and the SP-D gene are highly polymorphic, and some of polymorphisms are associated with several infective diseases, including pyelonephritis. In the present study, we investigated whether some of these polymorphisms are associated with the risk of r-UTI in Chinese population. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of 32 female patients with r-UTI and 30 age-matched, unrelated healthy female subjects. Genotyping of gene polymorphisms was analyzed by PCR. Among 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (five of SP-A1, four of SP-A2 and two of SP-D) observed in the enrolled subjects, Ala19Val of SP-A1 and Lys223Gln of SP-A2 were associated with susceptibility to r-UTI. The frequencies of 19Ala allele of SP-A1 gene (p = 0.038) and 223Gln allele of SP-A2 gene (p = 0.012) in the patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. The serum SP-A and SP-D levels were increased and the urine SP-A and SP-D levels were decreased in r-UTI patients compared with control subjects (p < 0.05). r-UTI patients with 19Ala/Ala or 223Gln/Gln genotype were associated with high serum and low urine SP-A levels (p < 0.01). Therefore, the 19Ala allele of SP-A1 gene and the 223Gln allele of SP-A2 gene are risk factors for r-UTI. © 2010 Tohoku University Medical Press.

Water pressure is imposed on the inside of the ring specimen to cause tensile failure. As water pressure is imposed, uniform radial tensile stress is produced along the inner side of ring specimen and crack will be appeared in the weakest direction of ring specimen. The tester is made up with light-weight material to fit the need of Computerized Tomography scanning and there is no need to change the scanning surface during the loading and scanning process. The test results show that the tester is reliable and easy to operate. With the aid of Computerized Tomography, the tester can be used to evaluate the influence of inner structure to mechanical prosperities of asphalt concrete.

77955651020	The prepared tau exon-specific antibodies revealed distinct profiles of tau in CSF of the patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease	Background: The diagnostic value of CSF tau for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been widely evaluated, showing a markedly disease-relative manner. However, the profiles of tau isoforms in CSF of CJD patients remain unknown. Here, we prepared the exon-specific antibodies against the peptides encoded by exon-2, exon-3 and exon-10 of human tau protein and evaluated the reactive profiles of tau in CSF samples from the patients with probable CJD. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sequences encoding exon-2, exon-3 and exon-10 of human tau protein were cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T. Using recombinant fusion proteins GST-E2, GST-E3 and GST-E10, three tau exon-specific antibodies were elicited. Reliable specificities of the prepared antibodies were obtained after a serial of purification processes, not only in recognizing the tau peptides encoded by exon-2, -3 and -10, but also in distinguishing six recombinant tau isoforms by Western blot and ELISA. Three predominant tau-specific bands were observed in CSF samples with the exon-specific and the commercial tau antibodies, respectively, showing different reactive profiles between the groups of probable CJD and non-CJD. A 65 KD band was detected only in the CSF samples from probable CJD patients, especially with the antibodies against exon-2 (Anti-tE2) and exon-10 (Anit-tE10). The appearances of 65 KD band in CSF correlated well with positive 14-3-3 in CSF and typical abnormality in EEG. Such band was not observed in the CSF samples of six tested genetic CJD patients. Conclusions/Significance: Three exon-specific polyclonal antibodies were successfully prepared. Based on these antibodies, different CSF tau profiles in Western blots were observed between the groups of probable CJD and non-CJD. A disease-specific tau band emerged in the CSF samples from probable sporadic CJD, which may supply a new biomarker for screening sporadic CJD. © 2010 Chen et al.

77955659356	Transient expressions of doppel and its structural analog prionΔ32-121 in SH-SY5Y cells caused cytotoxicity possibly by triggering similar apoptosis pathway	Doppel (Dpl) is a recently identified prion (PrP)-like protein due to the structural and biochemical similarities, however, its natural function and pathogenic role in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. To investigate the possible pathogenic pathway of Dpl and its structural analog for cell apoptosis, mammalian expressing recombinant plasmids containing human PRND gene encoding the full-length Dpl and a truncated human PRNP gene deleting the sequences encoding the peptide from aa 32 to 121 (PrPΔ32-121) were generated. MTT assays showed the cell viabilities of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y receiving Dpl and PrPΔ32-121 expressing plasmids were remarkably lower. Obvious apoptosis phenomena were observed to be associated with the cells transient expressing Dpl and PrPΔ32-121, including reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ψm), decreased pro-caspase-3 quantity, more numbers of annexin V- and annexin V/PI-double-stained cells and depressed Bcl-2 level. Moreover, we also found that the Dpl- and PrPΔ32-121-induced cytotoxicities and relevant apoptotic events in SH-SY5Y cells could be fully antagonized by co-expression of the human full-length PrP. These data highly indicate that cytotoxicity induced by the expression of Dpl and truncated PrP in neural derived cells are closely related with the apoptosis process, probably triggering the mitochondrial pathway. It also implies that the cell-benefit activity of the full-length PrP may result from its anti-apoptosis capacity. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77958005411	Elevated levels of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with probable Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease	A definitive diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) can only be made by neuropathologic examination and demonstration of typical pathologic changes and the pathologic prion protein in central nervous tissues. This study investigated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the microtubule-association protein tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Chinese patients with sporadic CJD. Methods: Two hundred two CSF samples from clinically suspected patients with sporadic CJD were analyzed for tau protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for the signal transduction regulatory protein 14-3-3 protein by immunoblot. Results: Remarkably increased levels of tau protein and increased incidence of 14-3-3 positivity were observed in probable CJD, when compared with possible CJD and others. With a threshold of 1400 pg/mL, tau determination showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94% for the diagnosis of probable CJD. The combination of raised tau and positive 14-3-3 increased the specificity but slightly reduced the sensitivity. Statistical analysis indicated that the raised level of tau positively correlated with the presence of 14-3-3 in CSF but not with other main clinical features, eg, age, gender, clinical manifestations and sampling time. Conclusions: These data suggest that Chinese patients with probable CJD have similar increased levels of tau in the CSF as in Caucasian patients. Measurement of CSF tau will be another potential technique for antemortem CJD diagnosis. © Copyright 2010 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

77956966416	Molecular interaction of α-synuclein with tubulin influences on the polymerization of microtubule in vitro and structure of microtubule in cells	Microtubule dynamics is essential for many vital cellular processes such as in intracellular transport, metabolism, and cell division. Evidences demonstrate that α-synuclein may associate with microtubular cytoskeleton and its major component, tubulin. In the present study, the molecular interaction between α-synuclein and tubulin was confirmed by GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation. The interacting regions within α-synuclein with tubulin were mapped at the residues 60-100 of α-synuclein that is critical for the binding activity with tubulin. Microtubule assembly assays and sedimentation tests demonstrated that α-synuclein influenced the polymerization of tubulin in vitro, revealing an interacting region-dependent feature. Confocal microscopy detected that exposures of α-synuclein proteins inhibited microtubule formation in the cultured cells, with a length-dependent phenomenon. Our data highlight a potential role of α-synuclein in regulating the microtubule dynamics in neurons. The association of α-synuclein with tubulin may further provide insight into the biological and pathophysiological function of synuclein. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

78651289867	Functional characterization of pheromone receptors in the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens	Functional analyses of candidate Heliothis virescens pheromone odorant receptors (HvORs) were conducted using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. HvOR6 was found to be highly tuned to Z9-14:Ald, while HvOR13, HvOR14 and HvOR16 showed specificity for Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:OAc and Z11-16:OH, respectively. HvOR15, which had been considered a candidate receptor for Z9-14:Ald did not respond to any of the pheromone compounds tested, nor to 50 other general odorants. Thus, while HvOR15 is specifically expressed in H. virescens male antennae, its role in pheromone reception remains unknown. Based on our results and previous research we can now assign pheromone receptors in H. virescens males to each of the critical H. virescens agonistic pheromone compounds and two antagonistic compounds produced by heterospecific females. © 2010 The Authors.

79551507564	Familial CJD associated PrP mutants within transmembrane region induced CTM-PrP retention in ER and Triggered apoptosis by ER stress in SH-SY5Y cells	Background: Genetic prion diseases are linked to point and inserted mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene that are presumed to favor conversion of the cellular isoform of PrP (PrPC) to the pathogenic one (PrPSc). The pathogenic mechanisms and the subcellular sites of the conversion are not completely understood. Here we introduce several PRNP gene mutations (such as, PrP-KDEL, PrP-3AV, PrP-A117V, PrP-G114V, PrP-P102L and PrP-E200K) into the cultured cells in order to explore the pathogenic mechanism of familial prion disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address the roles of aberrant retention of PrP in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the recombinant plasmids expressing full-length human PrP tailed with an ER signal peptide at the COOH-terminal (PrP-KDEL) and PrP with three amino acids exchange in transmembrane region (PrP-3AV) were constructed. In the preparations of transient transfections, 18-kD COOH-terminal proteolytic resistant fragments (Ctm-PrP) were detected in the cells expressing PrP-KDEL and PrP-3AV. Analyses of the cell viabilities in the presences of tunicamycin and brefeldin A revealed that expressions of PrP-KDEL and PrP-3AV sensitized the transfected cells to ER stress stimuli. Western blots and RT-PCR identified the clear alternations of ER stress associated events in the cells expressing PrP-KDEL and PrP-3AV that induced ER mediated apoptosis by CHOP and capase-12 apoptosis pathway. Moreover, several familial CJD related PrP mutants were transiently introduced into the cultured cells. Only the mutants within the transmembrane region (G114V and A117V) induced the formation of Ctm-PrP and caused the ER stress, while the mutants outside the transmembrane region (P102L and E200K) failed. Conclusions/Significance: The data indicate that the retention of PrP in ER through formation of Ctm-PrP results in ER stress and cell apoptosis. The cytopathic activities caused by different familial CJD associated PrP mutants may vary, among them the mutants within the transmembrane region undergo an ER-stress mediated cell apoptosis. © 2011 Wang et al.

79952645925	Influence of mist intervals and aeration rate on growth and second metabolite production of Pseudostellaria heterophylla adventitious roots in a siphon-mist bioreactor	Plant adventitious root culture in bioreactors is a promising alternative for the efficient production of medicinal herbs. Adventitious roots of Pseudostellaria heterophylla were induced from callus and then cultivated in a siphon-mist bioreactor. An orthogonal test established that the optimal medium for adventitious root induction was MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L naphthaleneacetic acid and 2.0 mg/L 3-indolybutyric acid. Under these conditions, the average root number was more than 14 on each 1.0 cm diameter callus and the rooting rate reached 100%. The bioreactor was equipped with an integral siphon-spraying device designed to automatically supply the liquid medium. The operation parameters of the bioreactor were assessed by varying the mist interval and the aeration velocity. The mist interval was negatively related to average growth rate of the adventitious roots and positively related to saponin and polysaccharide content. A relatively high aeration rate was necessary to achieve the maximum biomass production, but the secondary metabolite production was not enhanced by increasing the aeration velocity. © 2010 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag.

79955978243	Functional characterization and immunolocalization of odorant binding protein 1 in the lucerne plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus (GOEZE)	In the insect phylum, the relationships between individuals and their environment are often modulated by chemical communication. Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are widely and robustly expressed in insect olfactory organs and play a key role in chemosensing and transporting hydrophobic odorants across the sensillum lymph to the olfactory receptor neuron. In this study, a novel OBP gene (AlinOBP1) in the lucerne plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus was identified, cloned and expressed. Real-time PCR results indicated that the expression level of AlinOBP1 gene differed in each developmental stage (from first instar to adult) and was predominantly expressed in the antennae of adults. The expression level of AlinOBP1 was 1.91 times higher in male antennae than in female antennae. The binding properties of AlinOBP1 with 114 odorants were measured using a fluorescence probe, N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (1-NPN), with fluorescence competitive binding. The results revealed that AlinOBP1 exhibits high binding abilities with two major putative pheromone components, ethyl butyrate and trans-2-hexenyl butyrate. In addition, it was observed that six volatiles released from cotton, octanal, nonanal, decanal, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, β-caryophyllene and β-ionone also bind to AlinOBP1. Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that AlinOBP1 was expressed in the sensillum lymph of sensilla trichodica and sensilla basiconca. Our results demonstrate that AlinOBP1 may function as a carrier in the chemoperception of the lucerne plant bug. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79955809111	Cytosolic PrP induces apoptosis of cell by disrupting microtubule assembly	Prion protein (PrP) is able to bind with tubulin and to interfere with the formation of microtubule. To investigate the influence of accumulation of cytosolic PrP in cytoplasm on microtubule, plasmid pcDNA3.1-PrP23-230 expressing human PrP23-230 was introduced into HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation assays identified the molecular interaction between cytosolic PrP and cellular tubulin. Confocal microscopy showed the co-localization of the expressed cytosolic PrP with tubulin in cytoplasm. Immunofluorescent assays of tubulin illustrated remarkable disruption of microtubular structures in the cells accumulated with cytosolic PrP. Meanwhile, the expressed cytosolic PrP significantly reduced cell viability and induced cell apoptosis. The amounts of microtubule protein in the cells expressing cytosolic PrP were decreased. Moreover, the levels of endogenous tubulin in the brain tissues of scrapie-infected hamsters were significantly lower than that of normal one. It highlights a close linkage between disruption of microtubule framework and cell death caused by abnormal presence of cellular PrP in cytoplasm. The association of apoptosis with microtubule-disrupting activity caused by cytosolic PrP may further provide insight into the unresolved biological function of PrP in the neurons. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

Gdovnina□V.V. et al. has used a permanent magnets to be the initial energy source to drive a magneto-cumulative generator, but the energy density stored in a single permanent magnet is very low. In this paper the possibility of using periodic permanent magnetic structure to be initial energy source of magneto-cumulative generator is analyzed numerically. It is concluded that 1kJ initial energy can be provided to magneto-cumulative generator by the periodic-ring permanent magnetic structure which weights less than 30kg and the outside radius less than 30cm, and some relative technical problems are also considered.

The characteristic data of coal quality in practical boiler operating situation and the combusting condition in the furnace are taken as the input parameters. The soft measuring model was applied to achieve precise prediction and on-line measurement of the concentration of pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen released from blended coal combusting in the boiler in power plant. It was also used to guide the operators in power plant to optimize coal combustion and control pollutant release. Compared with the hyperball CMAC algorithm, the improved algorithm can effectively reduce neural network nodes and improve learning accuracy.

Its structure was characterized by FTIR, XRD, suggesting that PSBFZ is a complex compound with mainly boron-ferric-zinc-silicon polymeric species rather than a simple mixture of raw materials. Comparative flocculation behaviors among polyaluminium chloride (PAC), polyferric sulfate (PFS), poly silicate ferric (PSF) and PSBFZ were explored to treat practical wastewater, such as dyeing and printing wastewater, landscape wastewater and landfill leachate. The results demonstrate that PSBFZ exhibits the best flocculation performance. Under the optimum conditions, the removal rate of COD is up to 92.2%, 88.1% and 67.4%, respectively. The removal rate of chromaticity from dyeing and printing wastewater and landfill leachate achieve 95.4% and 90.1% while the removal rate of turbidity for landscape wastewater is up to 99.3%. © 2011 IEEE.

Over-expression of hpt could increase total tocopherol content, while over-expression of γ-tmt could shift tocopherol composition in favor of α-tocopherol. Transgenic lettuce lines expressing both hpt and γ-tmt produced significantly higher amount of tocopherol and elevated α-/γ-tocopherol ratio compared with non-transgenic control and transgenic lines harboring a single gene (hpt or γ-tmt). The best line produced eight times more tocopherol than the non-transgenic control and more than twice than hpt single-gene transgenic line.

Moreover, the steam temperature control was studied by using a method integrating the theoretical analysis with the simulation investigation. Under the condition that the sunshine illumination intensity is allowed and the feedwater has been heated and stabilized at 200°C, the steam temperature at the outlet of the solar energy array was controlled to stably and accurately attain 320°C by adjusting the feedwater flow rate of the feedwater valve and the steam temperature at the outlet of various stages of the heat accumulator was controlled and stabilized at a value above the expected one, thus preliminarily solving the problem in controlling the stability and accuracy of the steam temperature at the outlet of the solar energy array. It has been found that to use the sliding mode algorithm to control the steam temperature of a solar energy array is fully feasible and the stability, accuracy and disturbance-resistant control performance are realatively good.

82155164661	Evaluation of essential oil composition and DNA diversity of mint resources from China	Eight Mentha spicata accessions collected from China were characterized by both molecular and volatile analysis. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) evaluation was performed to analyze the DNA polymorphism of the accessions. Essential oil from leaf was also detected by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major components of the accessions are limonene (1.4 to 11.1%) and carvone contents (55.4 to 74.6%) for samples M. spicata1, M. spicata4, M. spicata5, M. spicata6 and M. spicata8, while other components are 1, 8-cineole (0.5 to 23.6%) and piperitenone oxide (30.8 to 38.5%) for samples M. spicata2 and M. spicata3, and cis- Sabinene hydrate (15%), menthol (16%) and pulegone (35.9%) for M. spicata7. Both AFLP and leaf volatile analysis were used to group the samples into two main groups, and similar dendrograms were obtained. However, the results shown in this study can be further applied in mint breeding. © 2011 Academic Journals.

83755182789	Disposal of mixed-organic wastes by continuous high-temperature composting	The present investigation was conducted to degrade mixed-organic wastes using composting with the optimal parameters of pH, temperature, the ratio of carbon and nitrogen (C/N), moisture and oxygen contents. All these procedures can be carried out within a period of 30 days. After composting, we recorded decreases in total heavy metal contents and ascarid-egg mortality, significant increases of the humus, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents and the microorganism numbers in the compost. Furthermore, 6 strains of thermophilic bacterial were isolated from the produced compost. On the basis of their small-subunit ribosomal RNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) sequences and in comparison with authentic strains, the 6 strains were identified as belonging to Paenibacillus polymyxa and Bacillus species and thereby concluded to be the dominant microflora in the composting process.

84859999966	A microstructure-based numerical simulation of visco-elastic properties of asphalt concrete with Semi-Circular Bending test	In present research, a method of Digital Image Processing (DIP) is applied to convert Computerized Tomography (CT) images into digital forms that can be incorporated into finite element modeling. 2D reconstruction and quantification are carried out to create 2D visualization of the internal structure of the samples. This CT discrimination based finite element modeling is used to analysis mechanical behavior of asphalt concrete, such as Semi-Circular Bending (SCB) test by taking into account the actual inhomogenei-ties and microstructures, especially voids distributions. This CT discrimination based finite element model is used to simulate the crack patterns of different samples under different loading steps, as the visco-elastic properties of the sand mastic and elastic properties of the aggregates are inputted into the FEM model. With the calculation results the visco-elastic parameters for Burgers model for asphalt concrete are predicted. The numerical results show that the material inhomogeneities and voids distributions can have significant effects on the tensile stress distribution along the loading axis of the sample and the coarse aggregates skeleton has greater influence on mechanical properties of asphalt concrete. It is believed that the proposed method can be extended to predict the mixture behavior based on ingredient properties. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group.

84860796425	Association of gene polymorphism and protein level of surfactant protein D with urinary tract infection susceptibility in adult women	Objective: To evaluate the association of surfactant protein D(SP-D) gene polymorphisms and its protein levels with the susceptible female patients of urinary tract infection(UTI) in Han population. Methods: Polymorphisms of SP-D-Thr11Met and SP-D-Thr160Ala loci were analyzed by sequence special primer polymerase chain reaction(PCR-SSP). Serum SP-D protein levels were measured using ELISA method. Results: The frequencies of Thr/Thr, Thr/Met, and Met/Met genotypes at SP-D-Thr11Met locus were 28.1%, 56.3% and 15.6% respectively in UTI susceptible patients, and 36.7%, 50.0% and 13.3% respectively in health control group. Allelic frequencies of 11Thr and 11Met at this SNP site were 43.8% and 56.2% respectively in UTI susceptible patients, as well as 38.3% and 61.7% respectively in control group. The frequencies of Thr/Thr, Thr/Ala and Ala/Ala genotypes at SP-D-Thr160Ala locus were 18.8%, 34.4%, and 46.9% respectively in UTI susceptible patients, while in control group they were 10.0%, 33.3% and 56.7%, respectively. Allelic frequencies of 160Thr and 160Ala at this SNP site were 35.5% and 64.4% respectively in UTI susceptible patients, as well as 26.7% and 73.3% respectively in control group. The frequencies of genotypes and alleles at SP-D-Thr11Met and SP-D-Thr160Ala loci showed no significant difference between the two groups(P>0.05). The serum SP-D levels were significantly increased in UTI patients as compared with those in controls(P<0.05). Conclusion: SP-D-Thr11Met and SP-D-Thr160Ala loci gene mutations are not risk factors for r-UTI in Chinese women, however the blood SP-D level was associated with UTI susceptibility in Chinese adult women.

84862799086	Impact of sex and ozone exposure on the course of pneumonia in wild type and SP-A (-/-) mice	Female mice exhibited higher survival rate than males after pneumonia, with a reversal of this pattern following ozone exposure. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) plays an important role in innate immunity and SP-A (-/-) mice were more susceptible to pneumonia than wild type mice. Here, we investigated underlying mechanisms of the differential susceptibility of mice to pneumonia. Wild type and SP-A (-/-) C57BL/6J male and female mice were exposed to ozone or filtered air (FA) and then infected intratracheally with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Blood, spleen, and lung were analyzed for bacterial counts, lung and spleen weights, and sex hormone and cortisol levels were measured in plasma within two days post-infection. We found: 1) in the absence of ozone-induced oxidative stress, males had higher level of bacterial dissemination compared to females; ozone exposure decreased pulmonary clearance in both sexes and ozone-exposed females were more affected than males; 2) ozone exposure increased lung weight, but decreased spleen weight in both sexes, and in both cases ozone-exposed females were affected the most; 3) plasma cortisol levels in infected mice changed: ozone-exposed > FA-exposed, females > males, and infected > non-infected; 4) no major sex hormone differences were observed in the studied conditions; 5) differences between wild type and SP-A (-/-) mice were observed in some of the studied conditions. We concluded that reduced pulmonary clearance, compromised spleen response to infection, and increased cortisol levels in ozone-exposed females, and the higher level of lung bacterial dissemination in FA-exposed males, contribute to the previously observed survival outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863074459	Surfactant protein D inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in human renal tubular epithelial cells: Implication for tubulointerstitial fibrosis	Surfactant protein D (SP-D), a member of the C-type lectin (collectin) protein family, plays a critical role in innate host defence against various microbial pathogens and in the modulation of inflammatory responses in the lung. However, little is known about its expression and biological function in the kidney. In this work, we studied SP-D expression in human kidney and cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2), and examined the effect of SP-D on proinflammatory cytokine production after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulus. We observed the expression of both SP-D mRNA and protein in human kidney and in-vitro HK-2 cells by immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. To explore the potential role of SP-D in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in kidney infection, we examined the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in HK-2 cells after LPS treatment. Results showed that the level of MCP-1 in the conditioned medium increased significantly when HK-2 cells were cultured with LPS (>0·1μg/ml) for 8h. Of interest, LPS treatment inhibited SP-D expression in HK-2 cells. Furthermore, over-expression of SP-D reduced significantly the LPS-induced expression of MCP-1 in transfected cells. These findings suggest that SP-D in the kidney functions as an anti-inflammatory factor in renal tubular epithelial cells and may modulate tubulointerstitial fibrosis in kidney. © 2011 The Authors.

84864985841	Functional characterizations of chemosensory proteins of the alfalfa plant bug adelphocoris lineolatus indicate their involvement in host recognition	Insect chemosensory proteins (CSPs) have been proposed to capture and transport hydrophobic chemicals from air to olfactory receptors in the lymph of antennal chemosensilla. They may represent a new class of soluble carrier protein involved in insect chemoreception. However, their specific functional roles in insect chemoreception have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we report for the first time three novel CSP genes (AlinCSP1-3) of the alfalfa plant bug Adelphocoris lineolatus (Goeze) by screening the antennal cDNA library. The qRT-PCR examinations of the transcript levels revealed that all three genes (AlinCSP1-3) are mainly expressed in the antennae. Interestingly, these CSP genes AlinCSP1-3 are also highly expressed in the 5

0037211442	Cloning, expression and immunocytochemical localization of a general odorant-binding protein gene from Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner)	A cDNA clone coding for general odorant-binding protein2 was isolated from the antenna of Helicoverpa armigera by RT-PCR and (5′/3′)-RACE technique. Results of sequencing and structural analyses showed that the full-length of GOBP2Harm was 636 bp, possessing 162 amino acid residues and a signal peptide of 21 amino acids. Its predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point were 18.2 kDa and 5.21, respectively. This deduced amino acid sequence shared some common structural features with odorant-binding proteins from several moth species, including the six conserved cysteine motif, typical of insect's OBPs. Northern blot showed that GOBP2Harm is specifically expressed in the antenna of Helicoverpa armigera at similar levels in both sexes. In order to obtain sufficient GOBP2 for further determining its biochemical and physiological properties, a bacterical expression vector of GOBP2 was constructed and successfully expressed. The protein was obtained mainly as insoluble inclusion bodies, that, however, could be solubilized and refolded. The rGOBP2 was purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The rGOBP2 was shown to cross-react with an anti-GOBP antiserum from Antheraea polyphemus. Finally, polyclonal antibodies against GOBP2Harm were used to mark the distribution of the protein in olfactory sensilla and were tested by immuno-electron microscopy. In the male, GOBP2Harm is mainly expressed in sensilla basiconica, while in the female, it is equally expressed in sensilla basiconica and in sensilla trichodea. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

84866785700	High precision measurement of the load effect of the resistor	The load effect of the resistor should be paid great attention for the precise measurement. Here a high accurate resistance voltage divider (RVD) used to precisely measure the load effect of the resistor is provided. A self-calibrated standard resistor at 100Ω with zero load effect is employed as one arm of the bridge, and several stable resistors with the same temperature coefficient and structure are connected in series as the accurate ratio free from the load effect. In contract to the direct current comparator (DCC), the load effect of the high resistance can be measured due to the low current requirement of the standard resistor. Several experiments have been finished to evaluate the resistance voltage divider and some results are presented here. © 2012 IEEE.

84866446146	Distinct roles of two alternative splice variants of matrilin-2 in protein oligomerization and proteolysis	Matrilin-2 (matn2) contains a unique domain, between the second von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain, with no sequence homology with other family members. Complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence analysis of matn2 expression in both mice and humans revealed an alternative splice site in the region of the unique domain, which forms a short and a long splicing variant (containing an additional 19 amino acids). However, the expression heterogeneity of the alternative spliced variants, and the roles of the unique domain in oligomerization and proteolysis of matn2 are unknown. In this study, we examined the expression of the two alternative splice variants of matn2 in several skeletal and non-skeletal tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Both splice variants of matn2 were detected at the mRNA level in all tissues studied. To explore the biochemical significance, several minigene constructs containing the second vWFA domain, the unique domain (with either a long or short form) and the coiled-coil domain of mouse mini matn2 were generated. Ectopic expression of these constructs demonstrated that the long form of matn2 is capable of self-assembling into several oligomeric forms, including a tetramer, trimer, pentamer or multimer; but the short form is only capable of forming a tetramer, trimer or dimer. Moreover, we observed that the splice variants of matn2 are important in modulating matn2 cleavage when co-expressed with matrilin-1 or matrilin-3. These results indicate that the two alternative splice variants have distinct roles in the processes of post-translational modification of matn2, which may have an impact on the homeostasis of the matrilin filamentous network of the extracellular matrix.

84868094162	Candidate Olfaction Genes Identified within the Helicoverpa armigera Antennal Transcriptome	Antennal olfaction is extremely important for insect survival, mediating key behaviors such as host preference, mate choice, and oviposition site selection. Multiple antennal proteins are involved in olfactory signal transduction pathways. Of these, odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs) confer specificity on olfactory sensory neuron responses. In this study, we identified the olfactory gene repertoire of the economically important agricultural pest moth, Helicoverpa armigera, by assembling the adult male and female antennal transcriptomes. Within the male and female antennal transcriptomes we identified a total of 47 OR candidate genes containing 6 pheromone receptor candidates. Additionally, 12 IR genes as well as 26 odorant-binding proteins and 12 chemosensory proteins were annotated. Our results allow a systematic functional analysis across much of conventional ORs repertoire and newly reported IRs mediating the key olfaction-mediated behaviors of H. armigera. © 2012 Liu et al.

84871648287	Expression patterns and binding properties of three pheromone binding proteins in the diamondback moth, Plutella xyllotella	Pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) play a key role in transporting hydrophobic sex pheromone components emitted by con-specific female across aqueous sensillar lymph to the surface of olfactory receptor neurons. A number of PBPs have been cloned, however, details of their function are still largely unknown. Here three pheromone binding protein genes in the diamondback moth, Plutella xyllotella were cloned. The three PxylPBP genes are not only expressed in chemosensory tissues but also expressed in female reproductive organs and male legs. To better understand the functions of PxylPBPs in the initial steps of pheromone recognition, three PxylPBPs were expressed in Escherichia coli and the ligand-binding specificities of purified recombinant PBPs were investigated. Fluorescence binding assays indicate that three PxylPBPs not only robustly bound all four sex pheromone components but also significantly bound pheromone analogs with at least one double bond, while weakly bound tested plant volatiles. Although pheromone analogs bound PBPs, they could not elicit the moth's electrophysiological response. These experiments provide evidence that PxylPBPs have limited selectivity of pheromone components and analogs and some downstream components such as odor receptors might be involved in selectivity and specificity of pheromone perception in P. xyllotella. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84872140961	Lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of surfactant proteins A1 and A2 in human renal tubular epithelial cells	Background: Surfactant protein A (SP-A), encoded by two functional genes, SP-A1 and SP-A2, is essential for the inflammatory process and host defence in the lungs. Recent studies have demonstrated the extrapulmonary expression of SP-A. Similar to the lungs, the kidneys are organs exposed to external pathogens. The present study evaluated the expression and location of SP-A in the kidneys. The effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the expression of SP-A subtypes was also studied in renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. Methods. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using polyclonal antibody against SP-A. RT-PCR was also performed using mRNA from normal human renal tissues and HK-2 cells. The expressions of the SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes were determined by PCR-based RFLP analysis, gene-specific amplification, and direct sequencing of RT-PCR products. Western blot was conducted to analyse the SP-A protein. HK-2 cells were treated with LPS at various concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μg/mL) for 8 h and at 5 μg/mL at various time points (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h). The LPS-induced expressions of SP-A1 and SP-A2 mRNA and protein were analysed by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: SP-A was localised in the renal tubular epithelial cells in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. SP-A1 and SP-A2 mRNA and protein were expressed in HK-2 cells and human renal tissues, which were significantly increased in time- and dose-dependent manners after LPS treatment (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Human renal tubular epithelial cells can express both SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes, which may play important roles in the inflammatory modulation of the kidney. © 2013 Jiao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84872843817	Sex pheromone recognition and immunolocalization of three pheromone binding proteins in the black cutworm moth Agrotis ipsilon	Insect pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) are believed to solubilize and transport hydrophobic sex pheromones across sensillum lymph to membrane-associated pheromone receptors. To address the molecular mechanisms of PBPs in insect pheromone perception, we undertook a systemic study on the PBPs of the black cutworm Agrotis ipsilon at transcript as well as protein level from tissue distribution and cellular localization to pheromone binding affinity. We cloned three full-length PBP genes AipsPBP1-3 from A. ipsilon antennae, and demonstrated that AipsPBP1-3 transcripts were highly expressed in male antennae. The electron microscopic examinations revealed at least six types of olfactory sensilla on male and female antenna: trichodea, chaetica, basiconica, coeloconica, squamiformia and Böhm bristles. The immunocytochemistry results demonstrated that AipsPBP1-3 proteins were strongly expressed in the sensillum lymph of the trichoid sensilla of male moth. The binding assays showed that AipsPBP1 had high binding affinities with the major sex pheromone components Z7-12:Ac and Z9-14:Ac among five related chemicals and was clustered together with the long trichoid sensilla-expressing LdisPBPs of Lymantria dispar. AipsPBP2 showed high binding affinities also with Z11-16:Ac. AipsPBP3 displayed a high affinity only with Z11-16:Ac. Our studies provide further detail evidences for the involvement of moth PBPs in pheromone discrimination and selective recognition of specific components of the female sex pheromone blends. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the myopic best response rule, players choose action and establish links with other players by unilaterally investing in costly pairwise links in the evolution of networks. First, we characterize the equilibrium networks and describe the impact of the link cost on the equilibrium networks. Next, we find that the dynamics of network formation plays an important role in the choice of players' action. At last, we illustrate and complement the analytical results by NetLogo simulation.

84875753734	Reaction path of one-pot synthesis of methyl N-phenyl carbamate from aniline, urea, and methanol	One-pot synthesis of methyl N-phenyl carbamate (MPC) from aniline, urea, and methanol is a green reaction route. However, along which reaction path the reaction proceeds is still unclear and thereby the reaction mechanism cannot be determined. So the present work put much more emphasis on the analysis of the reaction path of MPC synthesis from aniline, urea, and methanol. First, the components in this reaction system were identified by means of gas-phase chromatograph (GC), high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), and HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. On the basis of the change tendency of the reaction components with reaction time, five plausible reaction paths were conjectured: one proceeds via a dimethyl carbonate intermediate, another utilizes methyl carbamate as an intermediate, still another passes a 1-phenyl biuret intermediate, yet another takes place through a phenylurea intermediate, and the last one carries on using diphenylurea as an intermediate. Then on the basis of thermodynamic analysis of the five possible reaction paths in combination with necessary experimental verifications, the one via a phenylurea intermediate was determined as the major reaction path in the absence of catalyst. Lastly, the influence of catalyst on the reaction path was studied and the result showed that the reaction path changed from through the phenylurea intermediate to the methyl carbamate intermediate in the presence of γ-Al

84875073430	Molecular identification and differential expression of sensory neuron membrane proteins in the antennae of the black cutworm moth Agrotis ipsilon	The insect sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) SNMP1 and SNMP2 are transmembrane domain-containing proteins and are homologs of the vertebrate CD36 transmembrane proteins. It has been suggested that SNMPs play a significant role in insect chemoreception. Previous studies have demonstrated that SNMP1 is expressed in the pheromone-sensitive olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), whereas SNMP2 is expressed in the supporting cells. In this study, we identified two full-length SNMP transcripts, AipsSNMP1 and AipsSNMP2, in the black cutworm moth Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel). The qRT-PCR results indicated that the AipsSNMP1 and AipsSNMP2 transcripts were expressed significantly higher in the antennae than in other tissues of both sexes. The expression of AipsSNMP1 and AipsSNMP2 in the antennae from different development stages of both sexes was investigated and was shown to begin to express in the pupae stage from 3. days before emergence and then increased dramatically at the day of the emergence, and the high expression levels were maintained during the following 4. days after the emergence in both sexes. The mating status had no effect on the expression levels of the AipsSNMP1 and AipsSNMP2 transcripts. Consistent with previous in situ hybridization studies in other Lepidoptera insects, our immunolocalization results at protein level demonstrated that both AipsSNMP1 and AipsSNMP2 were expressed in pheromone-sensitive sensilla trichodea but with a completely different expression profile. AipsSNMP1 is more uniformed and highly expressed along the membrane of the ORN dendrites, whereas AipsSNMP2 is widely distributed at the bottom of the sensilla trichodea and highly localized in the sensillum lymph. Our studies provide further detailed evidence for the involvement and general functional role of insect SNMPs in the detection of sex pheromones and general odorant molecules. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84876170928	Functional Specificity of Sex Pheromone Receptors in the Cotton Bollworm Helicoverpa armigera	Male moths can accurately perceive the sex pheromone emitted from conspecific females by their highly accurate and specific olfactory sensory system. Pheromone receptors are of special importance in moth pheromone reception because of their central role in chemosensory signal transduction processes that occur in olfactory receptor neurons in the male antennae. There are a number of pheromone receptor genes have been cloned, however, only a few have been functionally characterized. Here we cloned six full-length pheromone receptor genes from Helicoverpa armigera male antennae. Real-time PCR showing all genes exhibited male-biased expression in adult antennae. Functional analyses of the six pheromone receptor genes were then conducted in the heterologous expression system of Xenopus oocytes. HarmOR13 was found to be a specific receptor for the major sex pheromone component Z11-16:Ald. HarmOR6 was equally tuned to both of Z9-16: Ald and Z9-14: Ald. HarmOR16 was sensitively tuned to Z11-16: OH. HarmOR11, HarmOR14 and HarmOR15 failed to respond to the tested candidate pheromone compounds. Our experiments elucidated the functions of some pheromone receptor genes of H. armigera. These advances may provide remarkable evidence for intraspecific mating choice and speciation extension in moths at molecular level. © 2013 Liu et al.

84876114321	Protective effects of exogenous surfactant protein a in allergic rhinitis: A mouse model	Objectives: A mouse model of allergic rhinitis (AR) was prepared, and exogenous surfactant protein A (SP-A) was given by an intranasal route to study its mechanism and effects in the mice. Methods: Sixty male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into a normal control group, a group with AR (AR group), and a group with AR that was given SP-A (treatment group). Results: A mouse model of AR was successfully established. Enzyme-linked immunoassay showed that the level of ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin E in the AR group was significantly higher than those in the treatment and control groups (p < 0.05), whereas the levels were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the treatment and control groups. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed typical allergic injury of the nasal epithelium in the AR group, and the number of eosinophils that migrated into the nasal tissue in the AR group was significantly greater than those measured in the treatment and control groups (p < 0.05). Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing revealed that the type 2 helper (Th2) cytokine (interleukin 4 and interleukin 5) levels were highest in the AR group, followed by the treatment and control groups, with significant differences between each of the groups (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found in the levels of nasal mucosa type 1 helper (Th1) cytokines (interferon ?, interleukin 12) among the AR, treatment, and control groups; the highest levels were found in the control group, and the lowest levels were detected in the AR group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Exogenous SP-A had a significant therapeutic effect in mice with AR, and its mechanisms of action included inhibition of the differentiation of Th2 cells in the nasal mucosa, reduced levels of Th2 cytokines, and increased levels of Th1 cytokines. Together, these effects corrected the Th1/Th2 imbalance, inhibited the increase of specific immunoglobulin E production, effectively reduced the symptoms of AR, and inhibited the development of AR. © 2013 Annals Publishing Company.

84879798198	An odorant receptor from the common cutworm (Spodoptera litura) exclusively tuned to the important plant volatile cis-3-Hexenyl acetate	Olfaction plays an important role in insect behaviours. The odorant receptor (OR) repertoire, housed within the dendritic membrane of sensory neurons, is one of the primary determinants of odour recognition. ORs in moths could be classified into pheromone receptors (PRs) and non-pheromone receptors (non-PR ORs). Much research in the field of insect olfaction recently has been focused on PRs of the male moth, but few Lepidoptera studies have been done on the functional study of non-PR ORs. In the present study, we identified and characterized four non-PR ORs from Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) antennae. The tissue expression pattern showed that the four ORs were mainly expressed in adult antennae and further in situ hybridization revealed SlituOR12 was expressed in both long and short sensilla trichodea and sensilla basiconica. A functional analysis of the four SlituORs was conducted in the heterologous expression system Xenopus oocytes. SlituOR12 was exclusively and sensitively tuned to cis-3-Hexenyl acetate and SlituOR19 slightly responded to 4′-Ethylacetophenone; however, SlituOR44 and SlituOR51 did not respond to any chemicals tested in this study. It is proposed that SlituOR12 might partially account for some key behaviours of the female, such as detection of host location and oviposition site. © 2013 Royal Entomological Society.

The synthesis of TDC from 2,4-diaminotoluene (TDA), urea, and methanol is a green route with a good industrialization prospect. So, the study on its reaction kinetics is of great significance. First, the reaction network was structured and simplified on the basis of experimental result analyses. Second, the experimental data for kinetics were measured on an autoclave. Last, the reaction kinetics model was established by means of parametric estimation. Model test results showed that the prediction values of the reaction kinetics model agreed well with the experimental data. Therefore, the reaction kinetics model can be used in the process analyses and scale-up of the reaction of TDA, urea, and methanol to TDC. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84880111649	Identification and functional characterization of sex pheromone receptors in beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua (Hübner)	In moths, males can detect a distinct blend of several pheromone components by specialized olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) on the antennae. Four candidate pheromone receptors (PR) with seven transmembrane domains were identified by homology cloning from the antennae of Spodoptera exigua (Sexi). Phylogenetic analyses reveal that all four odorant receptors (OR) belong to pheromone receptor subtypes. Expression patterns revealed that PRs were male-specific in the antenna except for SexiOR11, which was female antenna-biased. Functional analyses of these PRs were conducted using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. SexiOR13 and SexiOR16 were all broadly activated by multiple pheromone components.

The effects of reaction conditions on the synthesis of TDC-P were studied. The plausible reaction paths existed in this synthesis were speculated based on the result of HPLC-MS analyses. The results showed that the suitable reaction conditions for this synthesis were TDA/urea molar ratio of 1/3, TDA/PrOH molar ratio of 1/84, reaction temperature of 170°C, reaction pressure of 0.6 MPa and reaction time of 4 h, under which TDA conversion, TDC-P yield and selectivity were 95.3%, 66.1% and 69.4%, respectively. There existed three possible reaction paths in the TDC-P synthesis, which were (1) through propyl carbamate and propyl 2-methyl-5-amino-N-phenylcarbamate or propyl 3-amino-4-methyl-N-phenylcarbamate, (2) via toluene-2, 4-bisurea as an intermediate, (3) via propyl 3-ureido-4-methyl-N-phenylcarbamate or propyl 2-methyl-5-ureido-N-phenylcarbamate as an intermediate.

84880946576	Solvent effect on crystal structure of tetracycline hydrochloride	The crystal structure of tetracycline hydrochloride was simulated by Bravais-Friedel-Donnay-Harker (BFDH) and modified attachment energy (AE) models, based on the single-crystal data obtained by Material Studio software. A comparison to the scanning electron microscopy image of tetracycline hydrochloride indicated that the AE model was superior to the BFDH model. The morphology predicted by the AE model was further improved by taking account of the interaction effect between the growing faces and the solvent molecules. The final modification of the AE prediction provided good accordance with the observed results of the experiments. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84883256997	Fine structure and primary sensory projections of sensilla located in the labial-palp pit organ of Helicoverpa armigera (Insecta)	The fine structure and primary sensory projections of sensilla located in the labial-palp pit organ of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Insecta, Lepidoptera) are investigated by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy. The pit organ located on the third segment of the labial palp is about 300 μm deep with a 60-μm-wide opening, each structure containing about 1200 sensilla. Two sensillum types have been found, namely hair-shaped and club-shaped sensilla, located on the upper and lower half of the pit, respectively. Most sensilla possess a single dendrite. The dendrite housed by the club-shaped sensilla is often split into several branches or becomes lamellated in the outer segment. As reported previously, the sensory axons of the sensilla in the labial pit organ form a bundle entering the ipsilateral side of the subesophageal ganglion via the labial palp nerve and project to three distinct areas: the labial pit organ glomerulus in each antennal lobe, the subesophageal ganglion and the ventral nerve cord. In the antennal lobe, the labial pit organ glomerulus is innervated by sensory axons from the labial pit organ only; no antennal afferents target this unit. One neuron has been found extending fine processes into the subesophageal ganglion and innervating the labial palp via one branch passing at the base of the labial palp nerve. The soma of this assumed motor neuron is located in the ipsilateral cell body layer of the subesophageal ganglion. Our results provide valuable knowledge concerning the neural circuit encoding information about carbon dioxide and should stimulate further investigations directed at controlling pest species such as H. armigera. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84886432225	Enhanced liver autophagic activity improves survival of septic mice lacking surfactant proteins A and D	Autophagy is a protective cellular mechanism in response to various stresses, including sepsis. Sepsis is defned as systemic inflammation by infection. Surfactant protein A and D (SP-A and SP-D) are involved in host defense, regulation of inflammation, and homeostasis, but their roles in the autophagic activity and relevant gene expression in sepsis are unclear. In this study, mice lacking SP-A and SP-D (SP-A/D KO mice) and background-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice underwent either cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham surgery. The results showed that SP-A/D KO mice had lower mortality than WT mice in CLP sepsis. Liver tissues showed marked pathological changes in both septic SP-A/D KO and WT mice 24 hrs after CLP treatment; and quantitative analysis of liver histopathology revealed significant difference between septic SP-A/D and septic WT mice. SP-A/D KO mice had higher basal and sepsis-induced level of autophagy than WT mice (p < 0.05), as judged by Western blot and electron microscopic analyses. The expression of 84 autophagy-related genes revealed differential basal and sepsis-induced gene expression between SP-A/D KO and WT mice. The expression increased in three genes and decreased in four genes in septic WT mice, as compared to septic SP-A/D KO mice (p < 0.05). Furthermore, differential responses to sepsis between SP-A/D KO and WT mice were found in six signaling pathways related to autophagy and apoptosis. Therefore, enhanced autophagic activity improves the survival of septic SP-A/D KO mice through the regulation of liver autophagy/apoptosis-related gene expression and signaling pathway activation. © 2013 Tohoku University Medical Press.

84886994848	Gut-lung crosstalk in pulmonary involvement with inflammatory bowel diseases	Pulmonary abnormalities, dysfunction or hyper-reactivity occurs in association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) more frequently than previously recognized. Emerging evidence suggests that subtle inflammation exists in the airways among IBD patients even in the absence of any bronchopulmonary symptoms, and with normal pulmonary functions. The pulmonary impairment is more pronounced in IBD patients with active disease than in those in remission. A growing number of case reports show that the IBD patients develop rapidly progressive respiratory symptoms after colectomy, with failure to isolate bacterial pathogens on repeated sputum culture, and often request oral corticosteroid therapy. All the above evidence indicates that the inflammatory changes in both the intestine and lung during IBD. Clinical or subclinical pulmonary inflammation accompanies the main inflammation of the bowel. Although there are clinical and epidemiological reports of chronic inflammation of the pulmonary and intestinal mucosa in IBD, the detailed mechanisms of pulmonaryintestinal crosstalk remain unknown. The lung has no anatomical connection with the main inflammatory site of the bowel. Why does the inflammatory process shift from the gastrointestinal tract to the airways? The clinical and subclinical pulmonary abnormalities, dysfunction, or hyper-reactivity among IBD patients need further evaluation. Here, we give an overview of the concordance between chronic inflammatory reactions in the airways and the gastrointestinal tract. A better understanding of the possible mechanism of the crosstalk among the distant organs will be beneficial in identifying therapeutic strategies for mucosal inflammatory diseases such as IBD and allergy. © 2013 Baishideng.

84888121736	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene family of the pea aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum	The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) are cholinergic receptors that form ligand-gated ion channels by five subunits in insect and vertebrate nervous systems. The insect nAChR is the molecular target of a class of insecticides, neonicotinoids. Here, we identified and cloned 11 candidate nAChR subunit genes in Acyrthosiphon pisum using genome-based bioinformatics combined modern molecular techniques. Most A. pisum nAChRs including α1, α2, α3, α4, α6, α8, and β1 show highly sequence identities with the counterparts of other insects examined. Expression profiles analysis showed that all subunit genes were expressed in adult head. At least two subunits have alternative splicing that obviously increase A. pisum nicotinic receptor diversity. This study will be invaluable for exploring the molecular mechanisms of neonicotinoid-like insecticides in sucking pests, and for ultimately establishing the screening platform of novel insecticides. © 2013 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

84891342643	The design of control system for motion platform based PLC	In this paper, a new-style platform control system with three degree of freedoms: up-down motion, left-right rolling and front-rear pitching is designed, and also its composition, operating principle and soft design method are introduced. The system is driven by air cylinder and consists of FX series PLC, AD module, DA module, proportional valves, sliding rheostats and so on. Among these modules, sliding rheostats works as a feedback component to comprise a closed loop. Furthermore, to ensure the high positioning precision, the"PID"algorithm is applied. In addition, to control the motion flow reliably, the ladder logic diagram of the turn-off prior to turn-on is used to replace Sequential Function Chart. Experiments show that the motion platform is steady and safety when the proportional valves and directional valves are controlled by PLC. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84892492061	HPLC analysis of reaction system of decomposition dimethyl toluene dicarbamate to toluene diisocyanate	In this paper, a simple and accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis method for analyzing qualitatively and quantitatively the intermediate toluene mono-isocyanate (TMI) and desired product toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in the procedure of dimethyl toluene dicarbamate (TDC) decomposition to prepare TDI was established, in which the ethanol derivatives of TMI and TDI were determined. The optimal chromatography conditions are: methanol-water (6:4 by volume) as mobile phase, flow rate 0.5 mL/min, and detection wavelength 254 nm. Under these conditions, the calibration curves of the ethanol derivatives of TDI and TMI were all linear in certain range with correlation coefficients larger than 0.999, the relative standard deviations were all less than 1.0%. The method can meet the requirements for the analysis of TDC, TMI and TDI in the reaction system of TDC decomposition to TDI, and also meet the analysis of TMI and TDI in the industrial process of synthesis TDI.

84892681099	Expression of SNMP1 and SNMP2 genes in antennal sensilla of Spodoptera exigua (Hübner)	Sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) are olfactory-specific, two-transmembrane proteins. Previous publications reported that SNMP1 is expressed on the dendrite membrane of pheromone-sensitive neurons in Heliothis virescens and is an essential cofactor for pheromone detection in Drosophila. In this study, we cloned two SNMP genes (GenBank accession nos. JX469106 and JX469107) from the antenna of the beet armyworm moth Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Hübner). These SNMP genes are classified into two highly conserved subclades, indicating their importance in physiological activity of lepidopteran insects. SexiSNMP1 is antenna-specific in male and female adults, while SexiSNMP2 is antenna-abundant but also expressed in other chemosensory tissues, particularly proboscises and maxillary palps of adults both sexes. In situ hybridization revealed that both SNMPs are broadly expressed in long and short trichoid and basiconic sensilla. We infer that SNMP1 and SNMP2 act in the detection of the sex pheromone and general odorants. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84892975691	Abscopal antitumor immune effects of magnet-mediated hyperthermia at a high therapeutic temperature on Walker-256 carcinosarcomas in rats	The abscopal effect has previously been described in various tumors and is associated with radiation therapy and hyperthermia, with possible underlying mechanisms explaining each observed case. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the antitumor effects of magnet-mediated hyperthermia on Walker-256 carcinosarcomas in rats at two different temperature ranges (42-46 °C and 50-55 °C). We also aimed to identify whether a higher therapeutic temperature of magnetic-mediated hyperthermia improves the abscopal antitumor effects, where localised irradiation of the tumor causes not only the irradiated tumor to shrink, but also tumors located far from the area of irradiation. Following induction of carcinosarcoma in both sides of the body, magnet-mediated hyperthermia was applied to one side only, leaving the other side as a control. The changes in tumor growth were observed. Our results demonstrated that magnet-mediated hyperthermia at a higher temperature inhibited the growth of carcinosarcoma at the site of treatment. Furthermore, the growth of the carcinosarcoma on the untreated side was also inhibited. The expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen were decreased in the hyperthermia group, which was more significant in the higher temperature test group. Flow cytometric analysis showed an increased number of CD4- and CD8-positive T cells, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed increased levels of interferon-γ and interleukin-2 in the higher temperature group. These results suggested that magnet-mediated hyperthermia at a higher temperature (50-55 °C) can improve the abscopal antitumor effects and stimulate a greater endogenous immune response in carcinosarcoma-bearing rats.

84898428911	Identification of immunity-related genes in Ostrinia furnacalis against entomopathogenic fungi by RNA-seq analysis	Background: Timmunity-related genes inhe Aentomopathogenic funginia furnseq analysisée)) is one of the most serious corn pests in Asia. Control of this pest with entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has been proposed. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions between O. furnacalis and B. bassiana are unclear, especially under the conditions that the genomic information of O. furnacalis is currently unavailable. So we sequenced and characterized the transcriptome of O. furnacalis larvae infected by B. bassiana with special emphasis on immunity-related genes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Illumina Hiseq2000 was used to sequence 4.64 and 4.72 Gb of the transcriptome from water-injected and B. bassiana-injected O. furnacalis larvae, respectively. De novo assembly generated 62,382 unigenes with mean length of 729 nt. All unigenes were searched against Nt, Nr, Swiss-Prot, COG, and KEGG databases for annotations using BLASTN or BLASTX algorithm with an E-value cut-off of 1025. A total of 35,700 (57.2%) unigenes were annotated to at least one database. Pairwise comparisons resulted in 13,890 differentially expressed genes, with 5,843 up-regulated and 8,047 down-regulated. Based on sequence similarity to homologs known to participate in immune responses, we totally identified 190 potential immunity-related unigenes. They encode 45 pattern recognition proteins, 33 modulation proteins involved in the prophenoloxidase activation cascade, 46 signal transduction molecules, and 66 immune responsive effectors, respectively. The obtained transcriptome contains putative orthologs for nearly all components of the Toll, Imd, and JAK/STAT pathways. We randomly selected 24 immunity-related unigenes and investigated their expression profiles using quantitative RT-PCR assay. The results revealed variant expression patterns in response to the infection of B. bassiana. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides the comprehensive sequence resource and expression profiles of the immunity-related genes of O. furnacalis. The obtained data gives an insight into better understanding the molecular mechanisms of innate immune processes in O. furnacalis larvae against B. bassiana. © 2014 Liu et al.

84903388329	Molecular characterization of the Aphis gossypii olfactory receptor gene families	The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, is a polyphagous pest that inflicts great damage to cotton yields worldwide. Antennal olfaction, which is extremely important for insect survival, mediates key behaviors such as host preference, mate choice, and oviposition site selection. In insects, odor detection is mediated by odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs), which ensure the specificity of the olfactory sensory neuron responses. In this study, our aim is to identify chemosensory receptors in the cotton aphid genome, as a means to uncover olfactory encoding of the polyphagous feeding habits as well as to aid the discovery of new targets for behavioral interference. We identified a total of 45 candidate ORs and 14 IRs in the cotton aphid genome. Among the candidate AgoORs, 9 are apparent pseudogenes, while 19 can be clustered with ORs from the pea aphid, forming 16 AgoOR/ApOR orthologous subgroups. Among the candidate IRs, we identified homologs of the two highly conserved co-receptors IR8a and IR25a; no AgoIR retain the complete glutamic acid binding domain, suggesting that putative AgoIRs bind different ligands. Our results provide the necessary information for functional characterization of the chemosensory receptors of A. gossypii, with potential for new or refined applications of semiochemicals-based control of this pest insect. © 2014 Cao, et al.

84903946789	Narrow tuning of an odorant receptor to plant volatiles in Spodoptera exigua (Hübner)	Olfaction plays an important role in insects in recognizing volatile compounds, which are used to find food and mates, as well as avoid danger, predators and pathogens. The key players in the detection of volatile compounds are olfactory receptor (OR) proteins, which are located within the dendritic membrane of sensory neurons and extend into the lymph of sensilla on insect antennae. In the present study, we identify an OR gene, named SexiOR3, which is expressed in adult antenna in both sexes, but with female bias, in the beet armyworm moth Spodoptera exigua. Further in situ hybridization analysis revealed that SexiOR3 was mainly located in short trichoid sensilla. In in vitro heterologous expression experiments, SexiOR3 was narrowly tuned to E-β-farnesene and several compounds of related structure, among 62 different compounds tested in this study. Furthermore, SexiOR3 responds to E-β-farnesene at a low concentration of 10

84906733182	Identification of candidate olfactory genes in Chilo suppressalis by antennal transcriptome analysis	Antennal olfaction, which is extremely important for insect survival, mediates key behaviors such as host preference, mate choice, and oviposition site selection. In insects, odor detection is mediated by multiple proteins in the antenna, especially the odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs), which ensure the specificity of the olfactory sensory neuron responses. In this study, we identified the olfactory gene repertoire of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, an economically important agricultural pest, which inflicts great damage to the rice yield in south and east part of Asia, especially in Southern China. By Illumina sequencing of male and female antennal transcriptomes, we identified 47 odorant receptors, 20 ionotropic receptors, 26 odorant binding proteins, 21 chemosensory proteins and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins. Our findings make it possible for future research of the olfactory system of C. suppressalis at the molecular level. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84908055775	Functional characterization of sex pheromone receptors in the purple stem borer, Sesamia inferens (Walker)	The sex pheromone communication system in moths is highly species-specific and extremely sensitive, and pheromone receptors (PRs) are thought to be the most important factors in males. In the present study, three full-length cDNAs encoding PRs were characterized from Sesamia inferens antennae. These three PRs were all male-specific in expression, but their relative expression levels were very different; SinfOR29 was 17- to 23-fold higher than the other two PRs. Phylogenetic and motif pattern analyses showed that these three PRs were allocated to different PR subfamilies with different motif patterns. Functional analysis using the heterologous expression system of Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that SinfOR29 specifically and sensitively responded to the major pheromone component, Z11-16:OAc [concentration for 50% of maximal effect (EC

84919708310	Processing of pheromone information in related species of Heliothine moths	In heliothine moths, the male-specific olfactory system is activated by a few odor molecules, each of which is associated with an easily identifiable glomerulus in the primary olfactory center of the brain. This arrangement is linked to two well-defined behavioral responses, one ensuring attraction and mating behavior by carrying information about pheromones released by conspecific females and the other inhibition of attraction via signal information emitted from heterospecifics. The chance of comparing the characteristic properties of pheromone receptor proteins, male-specific sensory neurons and macroglomerular complex (MGC)-units in closely-related species is especially intriguing. Here, we review studies on the male-specific olfactory system of heliothine moths with particular emphasis on five closely related species, i.e., Heliothis virescens, Heliothis subflexa, Helicoverpa zea, Helicoverpa assulta and Helicoverpa armigera.
