22644439227	Dynamic interaction between dislocation and diffusing solutes	The dynamic dislocation-solute interaction is studied through a system integration method where a feedback mechanism is introduced to characterize the competition of pinning and depinning effects. The results self-consistently exhibit three branches of the interaction, two stable branches at low and high strain rate (or dislocation velocity) which correspond to the effective pinning or unpinning of dislocation, respectively, and a metastable one at the intermediate strain rate where negative strain rate sensitivities result from dynamic strain ageing. This unified description should be helpful to the studies of rate-softening plastic instability. © EDP Sciences.

23444447432	Experimental investigations on the temporal and spatial behaviors of the PLC effect in Al-Cu alloys	The temporal and spatial behaviors of the PLC (Portevin-Le Chatlier) effect in Al-Cu alloy are systemically investigated and analyzed. Under different applied strain rates, three types of serrated stress-time curves are obtained respectively. And the similarities and differences of them are compared and interpreted qualitatively. Correspondingly, the spatial propagating characteristics of the three types of PLC deformation bands are observed and analyzed. The evolutions of the propagating velocity for type A and B bands are discussed with respect to different tensile strains in the 3mm thick specimens. At the same tensile strain, the power law relationship between band propagating velocity and applied strain rate is also obtained. Contrasting the serrated stress-time curves with the position-time plots, the relationship between the macroscopic spatiotemporal behaviors is compared for the PLC effect. The influence of specimen thickness to the spatial correlation of PLC deformation bands is also discussed.

23644440969	Spatial characteristics of the Portevin-Le Chatelier deformation bands in Al-4 at%Cu polycrystals	The Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect represents a typical plastic instability in many metallic alloys of industrial interest. In space domain, this effect commonly consists of repeated nucleation and propagation of band structure, in which the plastic deformation concentrates, along the tensioned specimen. In this paper, a novel digital speckle pattern metrology technique including digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) and digital speckle correlation (DSC) has been applied to investigate the spatial features (geometrical shape, localized plastic deformation in band) and dynamic characteristics (propagation of the bands, details of the band migration) of the PLC deformation bands in Al-4 at%Cu polycrystals simultaneously and quantitatively. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

By employing the dynamic digital speckle pattern interferometry technology, the characterizations for the PLC deformation bands of type A (continuous propagation along the specimen), type B ("hopping" propagation along the specimen) and type C (random nucleation in the sample) were distinctly clarified. The corresponding positions of deformation bands were traced throughout the whole tensile process.

Moreover, the change of the strain rate range for serrated flow in Al-4%Cu alloys prepared by annealing and quenching heat treatments is reported too.

In the tests, the onset of Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect is delayed with increasing natural aging time. With further aging (such as natural aging for 24 h, or artificial aging for 20 min at 353 K), the amplitude and frequency of the serrated flow will rapidly decrease, till vanish. The effect of combination of aging and deformation on the serrated flow is also studied. The experimental results confirm the hypothesis about dynamic strain aging mechanism that is based on the interaction between dislocations and obstacles. The phenomenon of serrated flow appearing in the stress-time curves and no PLC deformation band simultaneously existing on the specimen surface is also discussed.

The detector is composed of a bi-material (BM) cantilever array, without a silicon substrate, which is eliminated in the fabrication process. Compared with the generally used sacrificial layer cantilever, the loss of incident IR energy caused by the reflection from and absorption by the silicon substrate is eliminated completely in the substrate-free structure. The IR radiation reaching the IR detector surface increases by over 80% in the case of the novel substrate-free detector array structure, compared to the sacrificial layer structure. Moreover, the substrate-free structure has less heat loss than the sacrificial layer structure.

The drop duration is found to be a constant independent of the strain. The average stress drop amplitude and the average reloading time of 1 and 2 mm thick samples increase with strain linearly, while the cases of 3 mm thick samples are much more complicated. The evidence of self-organized criticality is demonstrated, and the nonlinear mechanism in the PLC effect is also explained by comparing with the classic sand-pile model, and by combining with the dynamic strain aging (DSA) principle and the dislocation dynamics.

With the image analysis technology of digital speckle correlation method, the displacement and strain spatial distribution of PLC shear band were quantitatively obtained, and the evolution process of PLC shear band with time was reproduced. The results clearly prove an evolution mechanism of type B PLC shear bands, that is, a PLC shear band first nucleates at one side of specimen, then transversely runs through the entire specimen section with a certain angle, finally forms an inhomogeneous deformation bands. The experimental results show that there exists elastic shrinkage deformation outside the band during the formation of PLC shear band.

33748461444	Investigation of conformation transition of poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) by surface stress detection using micro-cantilever	A new method based on micro-cantilever sensors was presented and used to investigate conformation transition of macromolecules. Poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) were grafted onto one surface of a micro-cantilever by self assemble monolayer method. Then the micro-cantilever was immersed into distilled water in which the temperature can be adjusted in the range of 20-40 °C. The deflection of the micro-cantilever induced by conformation transition of PNIPAM chains was measured using optical lever technique. The results show that the micro-cantilever deflects upon heating and opposite deflection occurs upon cooling, which indicates that the surface stress of the micro-cantilever changes when the conformation of PNIPAM changes upon heating and cooling. The surface stress changes continuously over the range of 20-40 °C. However, a sharp change appears around the low critical solution temperature ( ~ 32 °C ), at which a coil-globule transition occurs in free aqueous solution of PNIPAM. The whole process is irreversible and shows a clear hysteresis, which can be attributed to the hydrogen bonding and the possible chain entanglement formed during the collapse process.

The size effect in Portevin-Le Chartelier (PLC) effect also manifests itself in the difference of PLC types of jerky flow of 1 mm or 2 mm thick samples and those of 3 mm thick samples under the same experimental conditions. Moreover, the geometrical characteristics of attractor of the former series in phase space are described by using methods of nonlinear time series analysis, and chaotic behavior is proved to exist in these series through the application of principal component analysis. The distribution of stress drops of the latter is found to follow a power-law distribution, which is referred to as the signature of self-organized criticality phenomenon.

33751112754	Experimental investigation on the 3D deformation of the nucleation process of PLC shearing band in Al-Cu alloy	The 3D deformation process of type-B PLC shearing band in Al-Cu alloy is captured by the help of a high speed digital photography with 1000 frames per second. A technique based on a novel high-speed digital speckle pattern metrology consisting of in-plane and out-of-plane deformation measurement methods is used for obtaining the playback of the 3D deformation process. The result shows one of the nucleation methods of type-B band: the shearing band initiates at a lateral specimen surface as a narrow band at an angle of 53° to the tensile axils and shears along the thickness direction. Subsequently the band front begins to propagate to the other lateral specimen surface along its length direction and expands in its width direction accompanying with the drop of the stress. When the front of the band reaches the other lateral surface, the band begins to expand in its width direction instantly and avalanchine shearing deformation happens. Based on the out-of-plane data, the relationship to the nucleation positions of following bands is that the latter one initiates on the front edge of the former one and the spacing of their center lines is half of the band width.

33846038241	Failure analysis of uncooled infrared focal plane array under a high-g inertial load	This paper describes the failure analysis of an uncooled infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) under a high-g inertial load system using finite element simulation and experimental validation methods. The uncooled IRFPA, responding to a source of infrared (IR) radiation with spectral range from 8 νm to 14 νm, is a cantilever array, which consists of two materials with mismatched thermal expansion coefficients. The radiance distribution of the IR source could be obtained by measuring the thermal-mechanical rotation angle distribution of every pixel in the cantilever array using a visible optical readout method. Based on this principle, room-temperature infrared imaging was developed under a static gravity environment, as described in our previous paper (Li C et al 2006 Meas. Sci. Technol. 17 1981-6). But under a dynamic inertial load, the rotation angle of every pixel includes not only the thermal-mechanical part but also a part induced by the inertial load. In the elastic deformation range, with a linearly increasing acceleration, the deformation angle induced by the inertial load increases linearly, which is validated by finite element simulation. This linear change in deformation, which can be subtracted from the total rotation angle in the optical readout using certain arithmetic, will not influence the imaging result. It is noteworthy that failure stress will occur when the deformation angle induced by the inertial load moves into the plastic deformation range, and the optical readout cannot image the IR object. Through finite element simulation the critical load resulting in IRFPA failure is 2715g, and this can be validated through impact using a Hopkinson bar after the IRFPA is placed in vacuum. By finite element simulation, the initial IRFPA surface profile without IR radiance after the 2715g load showed a conicoid characteristic. Simulation of the failure analysis of the uncooled IRFPA under 2715g acceleration predicts the military application of IRFPAs for an uncooled infrared imaging system in the high-g tactical range. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

33846913910	Influence of solute concentration on PLC EFFECT IN Al-Cu alloys	The solute concentration and precipitated phase content in Al-Cu alloy were altered by solution treatment at different temperatures. A series of serrated stress-time curves was obtained in tensile tests at a constant strain rate. The influences of solute concentration and precipitated phase content on dislocation movement were analyzed with tensile test results, and the micro-mechanism of Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was discussed. When solution treatment temperature is reduced from 500°C, the amplitude of serrated flow decreases, and reaches the minimum when solution treatment temperature is reduced to 300°C. On the contrary, the amplitude of serrated flow increases with solution treatment temperature decreasing continuously from 300 to 100°C. Experimental results show that, when solution treatment temperature is higher than 300°C, solute concentration is a governing factor to PLC effect, whereas when solution treatment temperature is lower than 300°C, the precipitated phase content affects dominantly PLC effect.

34347262130	Effect of solute atoms and precipitated phase in Al-4.5wt% Cu alloys on the spatiotempopal characteristics of the serrated yielding	It is well accepted that the interaction between solute atom and precipitated phase leads to dynamic strain aging (DSA). In this research solution treatments at different temperatures are adopted to control the solute concentration in solid solution and precipitated phase content in the Al-4.5wt% Cu alloy material, and their influences on dislocation movement are analyzed by subsequent tensile experiments on these treated material specimens, and the corresponding micro-mechanism of DSA is discussed. It is found that, when the solution treatment temperature is reduced stepwise from 500°C, the amplitude of the serrated yielding decreases until it reaches a minimum at 300°C, whereas the amplitude begins to increase as the solution treatment temperature is reduced continually to 100°C. Meanwhile, the heat-treatment also affects the propagation characteristics of shear bands. The experimental results also show that, when the solution treatment temperature is higher than 300°C, the solute concentration is the key factor influencing DSA. However, when the solution treatment temperature is lower than 300°C, the intensity of DSA is determined by precipitated phase density. In the case of room temperature, the micro-mechanism of DSA is found to be primarily governed by precipitated phases.

Three types of interactions between dislocation and solutes were obtained: At low strain rates, the dislocation is effectively pinned by its condensed solute cloud and the solute concentration remains almost at its saturation value. At high strain rates, the npinning effect predominates and dislocation moves at high velocity with little solute disturbance. While at the intermediate strain rates, the aging and unpinning effects take place alternately and dynamic strain ageing operates. Moreover, the N-shaped relationship between the rate-dependent flow stress and strain rate has also been naturally deduced from the model equations without additional assumptions.

A substrate-free FPA for optical readout infrared imaging is fabricated with a pixel pitch of 120 μm. The pressure dependences of thermal conductance of a FPA with/without substrate are studied by modeling analysis. Infrared imaging experiments are performed to validate the modeling analysis. At atmospheric pressure the total thermal conductance of the substrate-free FPA is only 1/1000 time of the traditional FPA which has a 2 μm air gap between the cantilever beam and the substrate. Room temperature object's thermal images are obtained even if the FPA is placed in the atmosphere. The air conductance of a substrate-free FPA at atmospheric pressure could be as small as that of a traditional FPA with a substrate in high vacuum (about 1 Pa). The experimental result also shows that the system noise keeps almost unchanged with the pressure. These characters will decrease the vacuum packaging request of the FPA and should be valuable for practical applications. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

In this paper, an Au/SiNx bi-material microcantilever temperature sensor based on optical readout is presented. The deflection of the cantilever varies with the change of temperature due to the differences in thermal expansion coefficients between gold and silicon nitride. Then, the temperature could be accurately measured by detecting the deflection of the cantilever with optical lever method. By experiments, the theoretical model is verified and the temperature characteristics of the sensor are also determined. With a commercial microcantilever, the temperature resolution of the sensor is tested to be 0.02 K when 25 mm length of optical arm set. By optimizing the microcantilever parameters, the temperature resolution of the sensor could be 0.1 mK.

84907904522	Nano-fabricated pixelated micropolarizer array for visible imaging polarimetry	Pixelated micropolarizer array (PMA) is a novel concept for real-time visible imaging polarimetry. A 320 × 240 aluminum PMA fabricated by electron beam lithography is described in this paper. The period, duty ratio, and depth of the grating are 140 nm, 0.5, and 100 nm, respectively. The units are standard square structures and the metal nanowires of the grating are collimating and uniformly thick. The extinction ratio of 75 and the maximum polarization transmittance of 78.8% demonstrate that the PMA is suitable for polarization imaging. When the PMA is applied to real-time polarization imaging, the degree of linear polarization image and the angle of linear polarization image are calculated from a single frame image. The polarized target object is highlighted from the unpolarized background, and the surface contour of the target object can be reflected by the polarization angle.

41949135087	Uncooled infrared imaging device based on optimized optomechanical micro-cantilever array	It is a major issue to improve the thermo-mechanical sensitivity of uncooled optomechanical focal plane arrays (FPAs) for infrared imaging. This work presents an optimized multi-fold interval metallized leg (IML) configuration to increase the thermo-mechanical sensitivity of an uncooled optomechanical bi-material micro-cantilever array. The inclination angle changes of the cantilever elements are measured in the IR imaging system using an optical readout with a knife-edge filtering operation in the spectrum plane. The multi-fold IML configuration consists of alternately connected unmetallized and metallized legs. With the optimized fold number, the thermo-mechanical sensitivity of a micro-cantilever array can be amplified to two times of one-fold IML for a 120 μm×120 μm element with 1 μm thick SiN

46149100050	Cantilever-based transducer for molecules configuration research	Microfabricated cantilevers have recently become increasingly popular as transducers in chemical and biological sensors. Here, an evaluation of laboratory prototype that is microcantilever-based optical detection is demonstrated. Surface stress changes when molecules adsorb on cantilevers surface, which offers an attractive way to chemical and biological detection by measuring the bending of cantilevers. In this work, different figures of cantilevers were fabricated. Preliminary evaluation of these microfabricated cantilevers was performed by comparing the intensity of reflecting light on the end surfaces of different cantilever figures and the stability of different cantilever figures in liquid. The result demonstrated that triangle cantilever with paddle acting as a flat mirror has better performance of light reflecting and stability in liquid. Then, cantilevers-based sensors were used to detect the conformational changes in PNFPAM molecules with temperature changing. © 2006 IEEE.

49549085115	Modeling and analysis of the thermal-mechanical optical readout uncooled infrared imaging system	To describe and analyze the system level noises of the thermal-mechanical optical readout uncooled infrared imaging system, a photoelectricity coupling model is presented. The photoelectricity coupling device in the model shows the noise isolation characteristic of the optical readout IR imaging system. Based on the model, the noises are partitioned into two kinds: internal noises which are from the Focal Plane Array (FPA), and external noises which are from the optical readout system. The Noise-equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD) caused by internal noises is calculated to be 5.94 mK theoretically. Experiment shows that the NETD caused by external noises is 98 mK, which is close to the NETD caused by the whole noises of the system. The results indicate that the calculation of NETD caused by the internal noises is reasonable and the primary noise problem of the IR imaging system is from the optical readout system.

55149118217	Uncooled infrared imaging using a substrate-free focal-plane array	A substrate-free 160 × 160 focal-plane array (FPA) with a 60-μm × 60-μm pitch has been developed and used for an optical readout uncooled infrared (IR) detector. The supporting frame of the FPA is a temperature-variable one due to its large decreases in both heat capacity and thermal conductance. This thermal characteristic significantly increases the temperature change of the microcantilever, which depends on both the temperature change induced by its absorption of IR radiation and the linear superposition of the temperature prechange induced by other microcantilevers, and therefore improves the performance of the substrate-free FPA. In the proposed IR detector, the fabricated FPA had an average noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) and a response time of 330 mK and 16 ms, respectively. Its performance increased by about 4.3 times compared with that of the substrate FPA that consists of the same microcantilevers. © 2008 IEEE.

56649109691	Propagation characteristics of portevin-Le chatelier bands	The Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) bands are traditionally classified into three types: type A are bands which propagate continuously along the specimen, and are observed at higher strain rates. Type B are bands move in a discontinuous manner, appear at lower strain rates, and give rise to the characteristic PLC serrations, or jerky flow; in some cases type C bands are observed, which nucleate at random sites along the specimen's gauge length. Laser speckle method and modeling are used to show that significant elastic shrinkage of the whole specimen is associated with type B or C bands, while the elastic shrinkage is negligible in the case of type A bands. Detailed observation of the propagation of type A bands shows a fine structure of serrations, of minute magnitude, in such a way that macroscopic elastic relaxation is not possible, hence the bands' continuous propagation. It is concluded that the differentiation between A, B and C types is rather artificial, as whether one type of band or another is observed depends only on the ratio between the externally imposed strain rate and that of the band, where as the fundamental physics of the bands formation and propagation remain unaltered by the strain rate. Further experiments and numerical modeling support these conclusions

60449101315	Performance of an optimized substrate-free focal plane array for optical readout uncooled infrared detector	This note presents an optimized substrate-free focal plane array (FPA), which is implemented in an optical readout uncooled infrared (IR) detector. The supporting frame of such FPA is a temperature-variable one due to the large decreases in both the heat capacity and the thermal conductance. This brings a unique thermal characteristic: the supporting frame functions as a "thermal isolation" frame which reduces the thermal conductance and therefore increases the temperature change and also functions as a "thermal diffusion" frame which certainly results in the temperature prechange in the ones not absorbing IR radiation. This characterization could significantly increase the temperature change of microcantilevers and therefore improve the performance of the substrate-free FPA. In the proposed IR detector, the fabricated 160×160 FPA has an average noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) and a response time of 330 mK and 16 ms, respectively. The performance of the IR detector theoretically increases by about 5.5 times compared with the one using a substrate FPA. Here, the geometry of the substrate FPA is just the same as the fabricated FPA, but the supporting frame is assumed to be a temperature-constant one. If the optical readout sensitivity can be increased enough using an enhanced IR absorber, the fabricated FPA thus has the potential to achieve a NETD value of 70 mK. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

62749084572	Optical sensitivity analysis of deformed mirrors for microcantilever array IR imaging	Optical sensitivity is a major issue to improve the sensor responsivity and the spatial resolution of uncooled optomechanical focal plane arrays (FPA). The optical sensitivity is closely related to the mirror length and the undesired mirror deformation induced from the imbalanced residual stresses in different layers. In this paper, the influences of mirror length and deformation on the optical sensitivity are discussed by Fourier Optics. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that the optical sensitivity is seriously degraded by undesired mirror deformation, and that there exists an optimal mirror length which makes the optical sensitivity achieve its maximum under a certain mirror deformation. Based on the results, an optimized mirror configuration is presented to increase the optical sensitivity of substrate-free bi-material microcantilever array (SFBMA). © 2009 Optical Society of America.

62249192134	Performance analysis of the substrate-free focal plane array in infrared imaging	Based on the proposed optical readout uncooled infrared (IR) imaging system, several batches of the substrate-free focal plane array (FPA) with different pitches have been successively fabricated, and by using these fabricated FPAs, the thermal images were obtained at room temperature. However, the theoretical analysis indicates that the deviation between the theoretical model assuming constant temperature of the supporting frames of the FPAs and the experimental results gradually increases with the decreasing pitch size of from 200 μm to 60 μm. Based on the finite element method, the thermal characteristic of those FPAs was simulated and the reason for the deviation is found to be that the temperature-constant assumption is not quite appropriate for the substrate-free FPA, and the absorption of the thermal radiation will obviously result in the temperature rise of the supporting frame, which would increase the temperature of the adjacent pixels. The imaging performance of the substrate-free FPA is also analyzed. Compared with the substrate FPA with the same pitch, the thermal detection sensitivity of the substrate-free FPA with 60 μm pitch increases by about one order of magnitude. ©2009 Chin. Phys. Soc.

The deformation heterogeneity related to the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect (PLC) in Al-Mg alloy during a tensile test at ambient temperature is investigated through temperature field measurement by infrared pyrometry. Under different applied strain rates, three types of stress-strain curves (types A-C) are obtained respectively. Correspondingly, the similarities and differences of temperature-strain curves are compared and interpreted qualitatively. And the spatial propagating characteristics of the three types of PLC deformation bands are observed and analyzed.

It is found that the temperature of solution treatment (ST temperature) has a remarkable influence on the amplitude of the serrated flow and the propagation characteristics of shear bands. These results are due to the effects of solute atoms and precipitates on dynamic strain aging (DSA). When ST temperature is higher than 300 °C, solute concentration is relatively high and solute cloud is a key factor of DSA. When ST temperature is lower than 300 °C, precipitate content is relatively high and the mechanism of DSA is determined by precipitates. © 2009 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

69249211252	Effect of precipitate on plc effect in 2024 Al alloy	It is normally accepted that the interaction among solute atoms, dislocations and precipitate leads to Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect during the plastic deformation of alloys. Precipitate is directly responsible for some inverse behavior of PLC effect, such as the inversion of the temperature dependence of critical strain; because these behaviors appear only when precipitate exist in the alloys. In this paper, the solute concentration in matrix and the fraction of the precipitate in 2024 Al alloy are changed by heat treatment. Subsequently, tensile experiments are conducted at room temperature (25°C) and low temperature (-100°C) on these treated specimens. The magnitude of serration and the critical strain of the serrated flow are analyzed and the results show that the diffusing solute atoms are necessary for the appearance of PLC effect while the cutting of the precipitate particles alone can not lead to this phenomenon. The mobile dislocations will be blocked and piled up strongly in the front of precipitate and thus precipitate will have an influence on PLC effect. This influence is obvious during tensile tests at medium strain rate.

The change of the interaction between molecules caused by conformation transition will change the surface stress of the microcantilever which causes its bending. The kinetic curves of self-assembly can be obtained by real-time monitoring the deflection of the microcantilever using the optical lever read-out technique. HS-PNIPAMs of different molecular weight were used to study the self-assembly process, and the results showed that the kinetic curves can be divided into three stages corresponding to different conformations, respectively. The first stage cor responds to physical adsorption of HS-PNIPAM on gold-coated side. The second and third stages correspond to chemical adsorption on gold-coated side with conformation transition. The kinetic curves fit Langmuir adsorption isotherm well. The results also show that the reaction rate κ of HS-PNIPAM is far less than that of small molecules and decreases exponentially with the molecular weight; while the time of HS-PNIPAM's self-assembly is far greater than that of small molecules and proportional to the molecular weight. The change of the surface stress is linear to the molecular weight of HS-PNIPAM. ©2009 Chin. Phys. Soc.

70350630335	Optical sensitivity analysis of a bent micro reflector array in uncooled infrared imaging	In an optomechanical infrared (IR) detection system, the optical detection sensitivity, a key factor that affects the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD), is influenced by the length and bend of micro-cantilever reflector of a focus plane array (FPA). The influence on optical detection sensitivity by such a bend due to the bulk micromachining techniques is discussed based on Fourier optics. In this study, the reflectors of the fabricated FPAs with pixel sizes 200 μm, 120 μm and 60 μm have the curvature radii of 23 mm, 11 mm and 8 mm, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that the sensitivities are degraded by the undesired bend of the micro-cantilever reflector. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the sensitivity reaches the maximum value when the reflector length L and the curvature radius R of the micro-cantilever reflector satisfy the relation: L

Primarily because of the bilayer structure of the usual such detector, deformation of the reflector is often unavoidable and seriously degrades the optical readout sensitivity. According to the theoretical analysis and experimental validation, an optical solution to this problem was established, and it was found that for the specific curvature radius, there are many characteristic reflector lengths and filter positions corresponding to the sensitivity peaks. When employing this solution, the sensitivity loss induced by the deformed reflector would be reduced to a minimum level.

In this paper, antibody sulfhydrylation and protein A were used to modify the microcantilever Au surface, and the antibody activities on the microcantilever were evaluated with direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dcELISA). The activity of the antibodies immobilized on the microcantilever via protein A was 1.7-fold of that via the sulfhydrylation reagent 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride. A microcantilever immunosensor method with protein A as the functionalization reagent was established to detect the residues of clenbuterol and chloramphenicol at limits of detection (LOD) of approximately 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Such LODs were better than that of the corresponding dcELISAs. The concentration of clenbuterol in a fortified feed sample detected with the microcantilever immunosensor after thorough extraction and purification agreed well with that detected with the dcELISA. Protein Ashowed to be simple and reproducible for functionalization of the antibodies on the Au surface and, thus, has common application values in microcantilever immunosensor development. The results suggest that microcantilever immunosensors be suitable for detection of small molecules, and the assay sensitivity is mainly related to the quality and activities of the antibodies. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

75849145830	Thermal analysis of serrated yielding in an Al-Mg alloy	The serrated yielding phenomenon is studied in an Al-Mg alloy during the tensile tests at ambient temperature and constant strain rate. The temperature field on the surface of the specimen changes with the increase of strain. An infrared camera is used to observe and record the temperature variations at very high time and space resolutions. According to these thermal data, the formation and propagation of the deformation bands (type A, B) are discussed and some characteristic parameters of the bands such as orientation, bandwidth, and apparent velocity are also obtained. Furthermore, the plastic deformation in the band is quantified from heat transfer equation. Both experimental and computational results show that elastic shrinkage deformation exists outside the band only during the formation of the type B band. Based on this, whether or not shrinkage deformation exists outside the band is proposed as a new standard to discriminate type A and B bands. © Chin.Phys.Soc.

79955113055	The influence of temperature on the PLC effect in Al-Mg alloy	An experimental investigation of the influence of temperature on the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect in Al-Mg alloy is conducted. Under a certain strain rate, the PLC effect is present in the temperature range of 223-328 K. The serration amplitude increases monotonically with increasing temperature, whereas the behaviors of the serration period and the critical strain with temperature include a descending branch under corresponding low temperature range and an ascending branch under corresponding high temperature range. The analysis in relation with dynamic strain aging (DSA) indicates that the temperature plays an important role in the PLC effect by dictating the solubility and the diffusibility of solute atoms. Both the concentration and the diffusibility of solute atoms contribute to increasing the serration amplitude. Under the descending branch temperature range, the serration period mainly depends on the preparation phase and the dominant factor of critical strain is the velocity of dislocations. However, under the ascending branch temperature range, the serration period mainly depends on the pinning phase and the dominant factor of critical strain is the applied stress required for unpinning. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The experimental imaging result and finite element method (FEM) analysis indicated that the substrate-free focal plane array (FPA) did not accord with the condition of constant frame temperature. This paper proposed a new theoretical model on thermal transmission of substrate-free FPA with electrical analogy method. Considering the system as a whole, the analysis of complex thermal interaction of adjacent elements could be averted while the heat absorption and transmission of frame could be considered. The temperature of outer frame was set to be equal to the ambient temperature as a boundary condition. Although it was not so flexible compared with FEM analysis when dealing with the boundary condition, the theoretical model was proved to correspond with the experimental result, and could be used as an approximate formula in thermal response calculation of substrate-free FPA. The model avoids the complication of FEM analysis, especially for large arrays. Further more, the model can be used for substrate-free FPA dimensions design and optimization under certain response target. © Chinese Physical Society.

A sensitive and specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated as mAb3D6, was generated with a GRe-bovine serum albumin conjugate as an immunogen. Microcantilever immunosensors (MCS), one modified with thiolated anti-GRe antibody and one modified with thiolated goat antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), were developed to detect the content of ginsenoside.

84862783293	Thermal analyses and simulations of the type A and type B Portevin-Le Chatelier effects in an Al-Mg alloy	The process of plastic deformation is associated with a transformation of mechanical energy to heat energy. In this study, the type A and type B Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effects were investigated by infrared thermography. The formation, propagation, and morphology of individual PLC bands were observed and characteristic parameters of the bands were measured. In particular, temperature increments originating from elastic shrinkage outside a deformation band were observed for the type B PLC effect, and this shrinkage was confirmed by a computation of the strain rate and plastic deformation within the band. Thus, we suggest a new criterion for distinguishing between the type A and type B PLC effects by the existence of elastic shrinkage outside deformation bands. A phenomenological model is described in detail, taking into account the effect of temperature changes, competition between mobile dislocations and solute atoms, and the influence of elastic deformation. The model has been used in numerical simulations of stress-strain curves and temperature changes associated with the PLC effect.

84867563205	A holistic approach performance analysis of substrate-free focal plane array	Based on a bi-material micro-cantilever thermal deformation principle, an uncooled infrared focal plane array (FPA) with optical readout has been developed from a substrate-based structure to a substrate-free structure. Infrared imaging of the substrate-free FPA indicates that this structure does not satisfy temperature-constant substrate conditions when the FPA unit size decreases from 200 μm to 60 μm. To evaluate the performance of the FPA, this paper puts forward an analytical model of heat transfer in the substrate-free FPA, by using a holistic approach and an electrical circuit analogy. The analytical model provides a fast and convenient way to calculate the temperature gray response and the response time of the substrate-free FPA. A substrate-free FPA with a unit size of 50 μm was fabricated. Infrared imaging experiments validate the model and indicate a noise equivalent temperature difference value of 170 mK has been achieved. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84867582368	Two mechanisms for the normal and inverse behaviors of the critical strain for the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect	The critical strain of the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect marks the boundary between stable and unstable flow. In this paper, tension tests were conducted at different temperatures ranging from 173 to 333 K. The PLC effect is present at temperatures of 223-328 K. Normal behavior of the critical strain is observed at temperatures of 223-298 K, while inverse behavior is observed at 298-333 K. By comparing the stress-strain curves at different temperatures, the curves for 173 and 333 K are identified as the lower and upper envelope curves, respectively. Before the critical strain, the stress follows the lower envelope curve at low temperatures, whereas it follows the upper envelope curve at high temperatures. The subsequent serrations, which are upward at low temperatures but downward at high temperatures, oscillate between the two envelope curves. Furthermore, different dislocation states for the lower and upper envelope curves are proposed. The lower envelope curve implies that few dislocations are pinned by solute, while the upper envelope curve implies that some dislocations are pinned by the solute prior to escape. The dominant factor of the critical strain is the diffusibility of the solute at low temperatures and the pinning strength at high temperatures. Finally, based on dynamic strain aging, two critical mechanisms in relation to the first pinning at low temperatures, and the first unpinning at high temperatures, are proposed and are highly consistent with the experiment. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

84872432797	Study on two critical mechanisms of PLC effect of 5456 Al-based alloy	The normal critical behavior at low temperature and inverse critical behavior at high temperature of 5456 Al-based alloy were observed via tension tests at different temperatures. By comparing the stress-strain curves at different temperatures, the lower and upper envelope curves were identified. Before the critical strain, the stress followed the lower envelope curve at low temperature while followed the upper envelope curve at high temperature. The subsequent serrations, which were upward at low temperature but downward at high temperature, waved between the two envelope curves. Furthermore, in relation with stress and dislocation motion, two types of dislocation motion for stable plasticity corresponding to the upper and lower envelope curves were presented, respectively. The lower envelope curve implied few dislocations were pinned by solute, while the upper envelope curve implied some dislocations were pinned by solute prior to escape. Finally, two critical mechanisms were proposed that the critical strain depended on the first pinning process in normal behavior and on the first unpinning process in inverse behavior. © Copyright.

84874374797	Design optimization and fabrication of the focal plane array reflector	In the optical readout infrared thermal imaging system, the initial reflector deformation of the focal plane array (FPA) decreases the optical detection sensitivity for the system greatly. According to the design and fabrication of the FPA, two optimized design schemes for reducing the initial deformation of the FPA reflector are put forward: thinning the Au layer on the reflector and fabricating reflector with stiffeners. Based on the theoretical analysis, a FPA with a unit size of 200 μm is fabricated and the Au layer of its reflector is thinned. Its reflector curvature radius and the optical detection sensitivity for the system are respectively increased to 4.71 times and 5.2 times of the FPA without thinning process. And a FPA with a unit size of 60 μm is fabricated, its reflector is with stiffeners. Its reflector curvature radius and the optical detection sensitivity for the system are respectively increased to 4.29 times and 1.18 times of that of the FPA without stiffeners.

84877350625	Mechanism and enhancement of the surface stress caused by a small-molecule antigen and antibody binding	Generation of microcantilever bending from biochemical interactions can have wide applications, ranging from high-throughput molecular detection to bioactuation. However, the origin of the biochemically induced surface stress causing the bending is a subject of much scientific debate and interest. Unlike a compressive surface stress caused by biomacromolecule antigen and antibody binding, here we show that a small molecule antigen and antibody binding on the surface gives rise to a tensile stress. We propose that the tensile stress is induced by antibody conformational change which manifests itself as Fab arm motion that exposes the C1q binding site of the antibody due to antigen binding. A microcantilever immunosensor was developed for the detection of Chlorimuron-ethyl (CE). We found that antibodies with oriented immobilization induce a greater resultant surface stress than those with random immobilization. The length of linker between the surface and the antibody plays an important role on the stress transmission. The shorter the length, the greater the surface stress. These mechanism and principles will underpin the design of devices and coatings to significantly lower the small molecule detection limit and may also have an impact on our understanding of antigen and antibody binding. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84880077595	Highly sensitive nanomechanical assay for the stress transmission of carbon chain	Abstract Here, we report the first quantitative experimental study into the molecular basis of the transmission of mechanical signal that originates from biochemical reaction focusing on the length of carbon chain. We designed an experiment by using n-alkanethiols with a same carboxyl group and different chain lengths (n = 1, 5, 10 and 15) to immobilize a same receptor molecule on the gold surface of a microcantilever, and detected the nanomechanical response of biochemical reaction. The sensitivity of the microcantilever was found to be greatly influenced by the chain length of linker that is between the receptor molecule and the microcantilever surface. The efficiency of stress transmission increases significantly with decreasing length of carbon chain. At the same time, we develop a label-free microcantilever sensor for highly sensitive detection of Glycyrrhizic acid (GL). The detection limit of the microcantilever sensor for GL is found to be as low as 20 pg/mL for the shortest linker (n = 1), which is 500 times lower than the longest linker (n = 15) and 50 times lower than that of the corresponding icELISA. These findings will provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of stress transmission, which may be exploited for biochemical sensor and nanoactuation applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84881361872	3D digital image correlation investigation of PLC effect in a new Ni- Co base superalloy	Repeated plastic instability accompanying serrated yielding in stress-strain curves and localization of deformation is observed during plastic deformation of many metallic alloys when tensile specimens are deformed under certain experimental conditions of temperature, strain rate, and pre-deformation. This phenomenon is referred to as the Portevin- Le Chatelier (PLC) effect. TMW alloy, a newly developed Ni-Co base superalloy for aircraft engine application, also exhibit PLC effect during tensile test at temperatures ranging from 300 ? to 600 ?, which are also the temperature range for engine working. In this paper, a 3D digital image correlation (3D DIC) measurement system was established to observe the localization of deformation (PLC band) in a tensile test performed on TMW alloy specimen at temperature of 400?. The 3D DIC system, with displacement measurement accuracy up to 0.01 pixels and strain measurement accuracy up to 100 με, has a high performance in displacement field calculation with more than 10000 points every second on a 3.1G Hz CPU computer. The test result shows that, the PLC bands are inclined at an angle of about 60° to the tensile axis. Unlike tensile test performed on aluminums alloy, the widths of PLC bands of TMW alloy specimen, ranging from 4 mm to 4.5 mm, are much greater than the specimen thickness (0.25 mm). © 2013 SPIE.

84883821251	A technology for eliminating stray light in optical readout of FPA	In the uncooled optical readout infrared imaging technology based on knife edge filter, the reflection of the optical elements bring in stray light spots in the CCD target surface. It makes the proportion of FPA image in the detected light intensity signal reduced, thus the sensitivity of optical detection is reduced. A polarized optical readout system was proposed. Polarizers and a quarter wave plate are added to the system. The polarizing beam splitter is used to replace the original beam splitter. The reflected stray light of the optical components in the optical path is thus eliminated. The proportion of the FPA image received in the CCD target surface substantially increased, so the optical detection sensitivity is enhanced. The polarized optical readout infrared imaging experiment result showed that the detection sensitivity increased by about 47% than the non-polarized system, which is close to the theoretical value.

In this paper, we present a polarized optical readout system to eliminate the stray light. Shading experiments show that, in the new system, the stray light is filtered out up to 86% and the dynamic range of the effective signal light significantly increase by 50%.

84886796864	Wave-plate phase shifting method	This paper proposes a new phase shifting method: wave-plate phase shifting method. By different combinations of a quarter-wave-plate, a half-wave-plate, and an analyzer, phase delays are introduced in the interference light path in order to achieve the phase shifting digital holography. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiments are conducted to verify the validity of this method. The numerical simulation shows that the result of the wave-plate phase shifting method is consistent with that of the traditional four-step phase shifting method. The experimental results successfully reconstruct the object light intensity in the image plane. Based on the wave-plate phase shifting method, a pixelated waveplate array structure is designed to achieve real-time phase shifting digital holography. The wave-plate array phase shifting method not only can reconstruct object image of high quality, but also can be used in dynamic phase measurement. Therefore, pixelated wave-plate array structure and wave-plate array phase shifting method could be widely used in practical applications. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

In this paper, infrared microscopic observation of absorbing particles trapped in gaseous medium is first achieved. When the laser power is about 1.0 W, the temperature of trapped toner particles (diameter is about 7 μm) and toluidine blue particles (diameter is from 1 μm to 20 μm) rises by about 14 K, which provides strong evidence for the photophoretic force mechanism.

When the load falls in the serrations, the slip deformation happens just like an avalanche, and the specimen takes a shrinkage deformation in the outside of the slip band to compensate the elongation deformation in slip band, even for a tensile test. The maximum elongation in the slip band causing by the avalanchine slip is about 7.6 μm.

According to this model, the thermal characteristics of substrate-free FPA under non-vacuum environment were analyzed. The result shows that, the substrate-free FPA has excellent infrared imaging performances under atmospheric pressure, while its NETD (noise equivalent temperature difference) is just increased several times than in the vacuum environment.

84899839828	Highly sensitive nanomechanical immunosensor using half antibody fragments	The improvement of sensitivity is of great significance to the application of biochemical sensor. In this study, we propose a micocantilever-based immunosensor in surface stress mode using half antibody fragments as receptor molecules. The thiol-containing half antibody fragment was obtained with a low loss of antibody biological activity and then was covalently and orientedly immobilized on the gold surface of microcantilevers via two native thiol groups. Such a one-step reaction and immobilization of receptor molecule simplify the preparation process of micocantilever immunosensor. Using shortened and highly oriented half antibody fragments as receptor molecules, the generation of surface stress and the transmission of stress from the interaction region of molecules to the surface of the microcantilever have been elevated significantly. The limit of detection (LOD) of the presented sensor has been significantly lowered to 1 pg/mL, or 1.1 pM in equivalence, which is a 500-fold improvement when compared with intact full antibody coated conventional micocantilever sensors. The results indicate that the half antibody fragment is well suited for the functionalization of the microcantilever surface and is generally applicable to all microcantilever immunosensor development, and this principle will help to design a functional film of devices with significantly lower LOD. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

The size of each unit is 7.4 μm, and the polarization directions of each adjacent 2×2 units in the polarizer array are 0, π/4, π/2, and 3π/4. The period, duty cycle, depth and surface type of the grating are 140 nm, 0.5, 100 nm and rectangle type, respectively. The scanning electron micrographs of the pixelated polarizer array show that there is no disconnection, cross and pollution on the fabricated metal nano-grating lines. The nano-grating lines are straight and uniform in thickness, and the surface type of the grating is ideal rectangular type. The polarization optical micrographs show that the pixelated polarizer array has good polarization characteristics. The maximum polarization transmissivity can reach 79.3%, and the extinction ratio can arrive at 454. Furthermore, the pixelated polarizer array is integrated with the charge coupled devise chip, and the Stokes parameters can be calculated from one frame, then the degree of linear polarization and angle of linear polarization can be obtained. Thus, the polarization enhancement of image is achieved, which can be used in the anti-stealth and recognition.

They mainly focused on the in-plane deformation. In order to achieve the high-accuracy measurement, three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) was employed in this work to investigate the PLC effect in 5456 Al-based alloy. The temporal and spatial evolutions of deformation in the full field of specimen surface were observed. The large deformation of localized necking was determined experimentally. The distributions of out-of-plane displacement over the loading procedure were also obtained. Furthermore, a comparison of measurement accuracy between two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) and 3D-DIC was also performed. Due to the theoretical restriction, the measurement accuracy of 2D-DIC decreases with the increase of deformation. A maximum discrepancy of about 20% with 3D-DIC was observed in this work. Therefore, 3D-DIC is actually more essential for the high-accuracy investigation of PLC effect.

84916920273	Simulations of the interactions between dislocations and solute atoms in different loading conditions	Dynamic strain aging, i.e. the interaction between dislocations and solute atoms, affects the mechanical properties of alloys. In this paper, a 2D-kinetic Monte Carlo model relating to the interaction between dislocations and solute atoms is developed to simulate the motions of edge dislocations in four different conditions. In "single dislocation with constant stress rate" condition, single dislocation is pinned under low stress rate, moves continuously under high stress rate, and moves intermittently under middle stress rates. In "multi-dislocation with zero stress" condition, the solute atoms gather below positive dislocations and above negative dislocations. In "multi-dislocation with constant stress" condition, the influence of solute atoms on dislocation motion becomes stronger with stress decreasing. In "multidislocation with constant stress rate" condition, the collective pinning and unpinning result in the stepped curve of total displacement. The simulated results present the process of dynamic strain aging in a microscopic scale and are consistent with theoretical results.

84920511453	Serrated yielding of 5456 aluminium magnesium alloy based on three dimensional digital image correlation	One of the key issues to deeply understand the intrinsic mechanism of Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) phenomenon is to analyze the spatial distribution and the evolution of the deformation in PLC bands, associated with serrated yielding. In this work, an investigation was carried out with 5456 aluminium magnesium alloy sheet specimens of different thicknesses at room temperature by using three dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) method, which focused itself on the deformation analysis within serrated yielding under different loading procedures. After statistically analyzing loading curves, it is found that the average amplitude and average period increase with increasing strain. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the average period and the thick-ness of specimen, while the average amplitude and the thickness of specimen are independent to some degree. In addition, the experimental result also indicates that the width of the PLC band increases with increasing thickness of the specimen. However, the spatial analysis in PLC bands proves that the angle between the PLC band and the tensile direction is about 60°, which is irrelevant to the specimen thickness and the serration amplitude. Furthermore, it is also found that PLC bands of out-of-plane displacement coincide with bands of strain in the tensile direction by temporal analysis. Most importantly, the experimental result shows that the serration amplitude is proportional to the maximum strain in PLC band when PLC band occurs.

10644282191	Macroscopic model for the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect	The Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect means serrated yielding or jerky flow phenomenon in some alloys. In this paper a macroscopic model is developed to investigate the PLC effect with the emphasis on mechanical response of the structure evolution on microscopic scale. In addition to the normal work hardening effect, the model takes account of the thermal activation of dislocation moving with the aid of stress and the collective interactions between mobile dislocations and solute atoms due to dynamic strain ageing (DSA). It can satisfy the negative strain rate sensitivity of flow stress, which is believed to be one of the most special features associated with the PLC effect. The heterogeneous nature of the deformed material is also considered by introducing a nonuniform spatial distribution of some model parameters. The serrated yielding and localized deformation behavior can be successfully reproduced via numerical simulation based on this model.
