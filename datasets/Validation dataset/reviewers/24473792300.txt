84946687482	Dynamic feedback bits allocation in distributed antenna systems with limited feedback	Efficient Echannel state information (CSI) feedback can simplify the signal preprocessing at the transmitter and improve the performance of a distributed antenna system (DAS). In order to maximize the feedback utility efficiency, we propose to dynamically allocate feedback bits across multiple remote antenna units (RAUs) according to the instantaneous channel condition for a given total feedback constraint. We first derive an upper bound and a lower bound on the spectral efficiency of the DAS. Then, by maximizing the bounds while satisfying the feedback bits constraint respectively, we derive two adaptive feedback allocation schemes. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect CSI at the mobile user (MU) is analyzed and the corresponding feedback bits allocation scheme is given. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive schemes have obvious performance gains over the traditional uniform feedback allocation.

34547280996	Cross-correlation analysis of generalized distributed antenna systems with cooperative diversity	In this paper, geometry-based channel models are proposed to describe the topology of generalized distributed antenna systems with cooperative diversity (GDAS-CD). The system architecture comprises M largely separated access points (APs) at one side of the link, and N geographically closed user terminals (UTs) at the other. The UTs are assumed to be operating in cooperative mode to enhance the system diversity. The average cross-correlation of signals received from noncollocated APs and UTs is derived based on the network topology and the correlation models derived from the empirical data. The analysis is also extended to more general scenarios when the APs are placed in a clustered form. The presented results would provide useful insight into the degree of possible performance improvement from the GDAS-CD. © 2007 IEEE.

36348949574	Diversity gains of generalized distributed antenna systems with cooperative users	A geometry-based channel model is proposed to describe the topology of a generalized distributed antenna system with cooperative diversity (GDAS-CD). The system architecture comprises a number of largely separated access points (APs) each with multiple antennas within an AP at one side of the link, and several geographically closed user terminals (UTs) each having multiple antennas within a UT at the other side. The UTs are assumed to be cooperative devices. The average cross-correlation of signals received from non-collocated APs and UTs is derived based on the system topology and the empirical models proposed by Sorensen. Subsequently, we investigate the diversity gains obtainable from the GDAS-CD based on the proposed model, which would provide insight into the degree of possible performance improvement when combining multiple copies of the received signal. © 2007 IEEE.

77954828867	Fast-group-decodable space-time block code	To make the implementation of high-rate space-time block code (STBC) realistic in practical systems, fast-decodable (FD) and group-decodable (GD) code structures have been separately introduced into STBC to reduce the sphere decoding complexity. However, no STBC has both the two code structures until now. In this paper, high-rate fast-group-decodable STBC (FGD-STBC, which has both FD and GD code structures) is proposed for the first time. We first derive the condition for FD code structure with the lowest sphere decoding complexity, then we prove that such FD code structure can be integrated with the GD-STBC for FGD-STBC construction. Analysis and simulation show that the proposed FGD-STBC has much lower decoding complexity and comparable performance with the existing FD-STBC.

84897894009	Performance analysis and optimization for interference alignment over MIMO interference channels with limited feedback	In this paper, we address the problem of interference alignment (IA) over MIMO interference channels with limited channel state information (CSI) feedback based on quantization codebooks. Due to limited feedback and, hence, imperfect IA, there are residual interferences across different links and different data streams. As a result, the performance of IA is greatly related to the CSI accuracy (namely number of feedback bits) and the number of data streams (namely transmission mode). In order to improve the performance of IA, it makes sense to optimize the system parameters according to the channel conditions. Motivated by this, we first give a quantitative performance analysis for IA under limited feedback and derive a closed-form expression for the average transmission rate in terms of feedback bits and transmission mode. By maximizing the average transmission rate, we obtain an adaptive feedback allocation scheme, as well as a dynamic mode selection scheme. Furthermore, through asymptotic analysis, we obtain several clear insights on the system performance and provide some guidelines on the system design. Finally, simulation results validate our theoretical claims and show that obvious performance gain can be obtained by adjusting feedback bits dynamically or selecting transmission mode adaptively. © 2014 IEEE.

59849083765	Intrinsic measure of diversity gains in generalised distributed antenna systems with cooperative users	The diversity gains achievable in the generalised distributed antenna system with cooperative users (GDAS-CU) are considered. A GDAS-CU is comprised of M largely separated access points (APs) at one side of the link, and N geographically closed user terminals (UTs) at the other side. The UTs are collaborating together to enhance the system performance, where an idealised message sharing among the UTs is assumed. First, geometry-based network models are proposed to describe the topology of a GDAS-CU. The mean cross-correlation coefficients of signals received from non-collocated APs and UTs are calculated based on the network topology and the correlation models derived from the empirical data. The analysis is also extendable to more general scenarios where the APs are placed in a clustered form due to the constraints of street layout or building structure. Subsequently, a generalised signal attenuation model derived from several stochastic ray-tracing-based pathloss models is applied to describe the power-decaying pattern in urban built-up areas, where the GDAS-CU may be deployed. Armed with the cross-correlation and pathloss model preliminaries, an intrinsic measure of cooperative diversity obtainable from a GDAS-CU is then derived, which is the number of independent fading channels that can be averaged over to detect symbols. The proposed analytical framework would provide critical insight into the degree of possible performance improvement when combining multiple copies of the received signal in such systems. © 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

70349176338	Multi-user SISO precoding based on generalized multi-unitary decomposition for single-carrier transmission in frequency selective channel	In this paper, we propose to exploit the richly scattered multi-path nature of a frequency selective channel to provide additional degrees of freedom for desigining effective precoding schemes for multi-user communications. We design the precoding matrix for multi-user communications based on the Generalized Multi-Unitary Decomposition (GMUD), where the channel matrix H is transformed into i r i H PR Q . An advantage of GMUD is that multiple pairs of unitary matrices i P and i Q can be obtained with one single Rr. Since the column of i Q can be used as the transmission beam of a particular user, multiple solutions of i Q provide a large selection of transmission beams, which can be exploited to achieve high degrees of orthogonality between the multipaths, as well as between the interfering users. Hence the proposed precoding technique based on GMUD achieves better performance than precoding based on singular value decomposition.

78649410639	Delay-tolerant cooperative diversity routing MANET	Some mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) such as inter-vehicle communications require a transmission scheme that is robust to mobility and asynchronous reception with low setup overhead. However, many existing cooperative MANETs have complex MAC protocol and high overhead. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer design across the routing, MAC and PHY layers, called delay-tolerant cooperative diversity routing (DT-CDR) MANET, in which network nodes work cooperatively to enhance the robustness of routing through cooperative space-time transmission. We construct a delay-tolerant orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) that supports low-complexity symbolwise decoding in the PHY layer. Due to the delay-tolerant code, strict synchronism is no longer required, hence simple MAC protocol is possible. Performance comparisons between the proposed DT-CDR MANET and conventional routing MANETs show that our design can significantly improve the end-to-end robustness and achieve cooperative diversity. ©2010 IEEE.

78650063938	Information-theoretic algorithm for waveform optimization within ultra wideband cognitive radar network	A novel information-theoretic approach for designing the excitation ultra wideband (UWB) waveforms within a cognitive radar network is developed. This method utilizes the mutual information (MI) between subsequent radar returns to extract desired information from the radar scene. With this approach, the radar system constantly learns about its surroundings and adopts its operational mode accordingly based upon the MI minimization criterion. Subsequently, the positioning algorithm makes use of this information about the radar scene to generate more accurate location estimates. Numerical results demonstrate an improvement in the probability of target detection even at low values of receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed algorithm also promises a better delay-Doppler resolution of the target, which can be analyzed through the radar ambiguity function (AF). Simulation data show an improvement in the target discrimination ability in the presence of noise and clutter. © 2010 IEEE.

Since group-decodable (quasi-orthogonal) code structure can reduce the decoding complexity, we present in this paper systematic methods to construct group-decodable high-rate STBC with full symbol-wise diversity gain for arbitrary transmit antenna number and code length. We show that the proposed group-decodable STBC can achieve high code rate that increases almost linearly with the transmit antenna number, and the slope of this near-linear dependence increases with the code length. Comparisons with existing low-rate and high-rate codes (such as orthogonal STBC and algebraic STBC) are conducted to show the decoding complexity reduction and good code performance achieved by the proposed codes. © 2006 IEEE.

To permit fast decoding, Sezginer, Sari and Biglieri proposed an STBC structure with special QR decomposition characteristics. In this paper, we adopt a simplified form of this fast-decodable code structure and present a new way to optimize the code analytically. We show that the signal constellation topology (such as QAM, APSK, or PSK) has a critical impact on the existence of non-vanishing determinants of the full-rate STBC. In particular, we show for the first time that, in order for APSK-STBC to achieve non-vanishing determinant, an APSK constellation topology with constellation points lying on square grid and ring radius √m

80053502277	Cognitive radio based hierarchical communications infrastructure for smart grid	The current centrally controlled power grid is undergoing a drastic change in order to deal with increasingly diversified challenges, including environment and infrastructure. The next-generation power grid, known as the smart grid, will be realized with proactive usage of state-of-the-art technologies in the areas of sensing, communications, control, computing, and information technology. In a smart power grid, an efficient and reliable communication architecture plays a crucial role in improving efficiency, sustainability, and stability. In this article, we first identify the fundamental challenges in the data communications for the smart grid and introduce the ongoing standardization effort in the industry. Then we present an unprecedented cognitive radio based communications architecture for the smart grid, which is mainly motivated by the explosive data volume, diverse data traffic, and need for QoS support. The proposed architecture is decomposed into three subareas: cognitive home area network, cognitive neighborhood area network, and cognitive wide area network, depending on the service ranges and potential applications. Finally, we focus on dynamic spectrum access and sharing in each subarea. We also identify a very unique challenge in the smart grid, the necessity of joint resource management in the decomposed NAN and WAN geographic subareas in order to achieve network scale performance optimization. Illustrative results indicate that the joint NAN/WAN design is able to intelligently allocate spectra to support the communication requirements in the smart grid. © 2011 IEEE.

82155188525	Block-orthogonal space-time code structure and its impact on QRDM decoding complexity reduction	Full-rate space time codes (STCs) with rate = number of transmit antennas have high multiplexing gain, but high decoding complexity even when decoded using reduced-complexity decoders such as sphere or QRDM decoders. In this paper, we introduce a new code property of STC called block-orthogonal property, which can be exploited by QR-decomposition-based decoders to achieve significant decoding complexity reduction without performance loss. We show that such complexity reduction principle can benefit the existing algebraic codes such as Perfect and DjABBA codes due to their inherent (but previously undiscovered) block-orthogonal property. In addition, we construct and optimize new full-rate block-orthogonal STC (BOSTC) that further maximize the QRDM complexity reduction potential. Simulation results of bit error rate (BER) performance against decoding complexity show that the new BOSTC outperforms all previously known codes as long as the QRDM decoder operates in reduced-complexity mode, and the code exhibits a desirable complexity saturation property. © 2011 IEEE.

84858322678	Review on energy harvesting and energy management for sustainable wireless sensor networks	Sustainable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being widely used nowadays due to two key driving technologies behind them i.e. energy harvesting and energy management. Energy harvesting from environmental energy sources such as solar, wind, thermal, mechanical and so forth are introduced from the perspective of energy supply to the WSN, while energy management of WSN such as the design of MAC protocol, design of routing protocol, and dynamic power management technology are presented from the perspective of energy conservation within the WSN itself. To better understand them in details for optimizing the sustainable WSN performance, in this paper, a review of these two enabling technologies are performed. More depth research into their combined efforts for sustainable WSN is presented and then illustrated with a case study. One of the most commonly referred energy harvesting source, i.e. solar energy, and its energy management which includes a new energy forecast model of wireless sensor nodes and a new model of energy distribution in WSNs using data collection protocol is investigated and demonstrated. © 2011 IEEE.

84862588060	Full diversity blind signal designs for unique identification of frequency selective channels	In this paper, we develop two kinds of closed-form decompositions on phase-shift-keying (PSK) constellations by exploiting linear congruence equation theory: the one for factorizing a pq -PSK constellation into a product of p- and q-PSK constellations and the other for decomposing a specific complex number into a difference of a point in p-PSK constellation and a point in q-PSK constellation. With this, we present a novel and simple signal design technique to blindly and uniquely identify frequency selective channels with zero-padded block transmission by only processing the first two block received signals. In a noise-free case, a closed-form solution to determine the transmitted signals and the channel coefficients is obtained. In a Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading environment, we prove that our scheme enables full diversity for the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) receiver. When only finite received data are given, the linearity of our signal design allows us to use iterative sphere decoders to approximate GLRT detection so that the joint estimation of the channel and symbols can be efficiently implemented. © 2012 IEEE.

84863126291	Energy-efficient cooperative spectrum sensing by optimal scheduling in sensor-aided cognitive radio networks	A promising technology that tackles the conflict between spectrum scarcity and underutilization is cognitive radio (CR), of which spectrum sensing is one of the most important functionalities. The use of dedicated sensors is an emerging service for spectrum sensing, where multiple sensors perform cooperative spectrum sensing. However, due to the energy constraint of battery-powered sensors, energy efficiency arises as a critical issue in sensor-aided CR networks. An optimal scheduling of each sensor active time can effectively extend the network lifetime. In this paper, we divide the sensors into a number of nondisjoint feasible subsets such that only one subset of sensors is turned on at a period of time while guaranteeing that the necessary detection and false alarm thresholds are satisfied. Each subset is activated successively, and nonactivated sensors are put in a lowenergy sleep mode to extend the network lifetime. We formulate such problem of energy-efficient cooperative spectrum sensing in sensor-aided CR networks as a scheduling problem, which is proved to be NP-complete. We employ Greedy Degradation to degrade it into a linear integer programming problem and propose three approaches, namely, Implicit Enumeration (IE), General Greedy (GG), and λ-Greedy (λG), to solve the subproblem. Among them, IE can achieve an optimal solution with the highest computational complexity, whereas GG can provide a solution with the lowest complexity but much poorer performance. To achieve a better tradeoff in terms of network lifetime and computational complexity, a brand new λG is proposed to approach IE with the complexity comparable with GG. Simulation results are presented to verify the performance of our approaches, as well as to study the effect of adjustable parameters on the performance. © 2012 IEEE.

84864362726	Joint rate selection and wireless network coding for time critical applications	In this paper, we dynamically select the transmission rate and design wireless network coding to improve the quality of services such as delay for time critical applications. With low transmission rate, and hence longer transmission range, more packets may be encoded together, which increases the coding opportunity. However, low transmission rate may incur extra transmission delay, which is intolerable for time critical applications. We design a novel joint rate selection and wireless network coding (RSNC) scheme with delay constraint, so as to minimize the total number of packets that miss their deadlines at the destination nodes. We prove that the proposed problem is NP-hard, and propose a novel graph model and transmission metric which consider both the heterogenous transmission rates and the packet deadline constraints during the graph construction. Using the graph model, we mathematically formulate the problem and design an efficient algorithm to determine the transmission rate and coding strategy for each transmission. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the RSNC scheme. © 2012 IEEE.

We then employ the ideas from constrained clustering and propose both a centralized spectrum-aware clustering algorithm and a distributed spectrum-aware clustering (DSAC) protocol. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that DSAC can effectively form clusters under a dynamic spectrum-aware constraint. Moreover, DSAC exhibits preferable scalability and stability with its low complexity and quick convergence under dynamic spectrum variation. © 2012 The Author(s).

Assuming each client possesses a subset of the total messages, we analyze the error correction capability when every client is allowed to broadcast only one linearly-coded message. Our error correction capability bound determines the maximum number of clients that can be compromised or failed without jeopardizing the final decoding solution at each client. We show that deterministic, feasible linear codes exist that can achieve the derived bound. We also evaluate random linear codes, where the coding coefficients are drawn randomly, and then develop the probability for a client to withstand a certain number of compromised or failed peers and successfully deduce the complete message for any network size and any initial message distributions. © 2012 IEEE.

84871769572	Zero-forcing based MIMO two-way relay with relay antenna selection: Transmission scheme and diversity analysis	Combining of physical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can significantly improve the performance of the wireless two-way relay network (TWRN). This paper proposes novel Max-Min optimization based relay antenna selection (RAS) schemes for zero-forcing (ZF) based MIMO-PNC transmission. RAS relaxes ZF's constraints on the number of antennas and extends the applications of ZF based MIMO-PNC to more practical scenarios, where the dedicated relay has more antennas than the end node. Moreover, RAS also brings diversity advantages to TWRN and the achievable diversity gains of the proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed. In particular, an equivalence relation is carefully built for the diversity gains obtained by 1) RAS for ZF based MIMO-PNC and 2) transmit antenna selection (TAS) for MIMO broadcasting (BC) with ZF receivers. This equivalence transforms the original problem to a more tractable form which eventually allows explicit analytical results. It is interesting to see that Max-Min RAS keeps the network diversity gain of ZF based MIMO-PNC to be the same as the diversity gain of the point-to-point link within the TWRN. This insight extends the understanding on the behaviors of ZF transceivers with antenna selection (AS) to relatively complicated MIMO-TWRN/BC scenarios. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

We suggest to feedback the parameters with variable feedback rate, and use efficient source coding and codebook to quantize the GR parameters. The variable feedback rate means that the number of bits used to represent the quantized beamforming matrix is based on the value of the matrix itself. And due to the non-uniform distribution of the GR parameters, source coding and code book can be designed to quantize those parameters in a more effective manner.

84876150531	Adaptive distributed MIMO radar waveform optimization based on mutual information	A novel approach to optimizing the waveforms of an adaptive distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is developed. The research work aims at improving the target detection and feature extraction performance by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the target impulse response and the received echoes in the first step, and then minimizing the MI between successive backscatter signals in the second step. These two stages correspond to the design of the ensemble of excitations and the selection of a suitable signal out of the ensemble, respectively. The waveform optimization algorithm is based upon adaptive learning from the radar scene, which is achieved through a feedback loop from the receiver to the transmitter. This feedback includes vital information about the target features derived from the reflected pulses. In this way the transmitter adjusts its probing signals to suit the dynamically changing environment. Simulation results demonstrate better target response extraction using the proposed two-step algorithm as compared with each single-step optimization method. This approach also results in improved target detection probability and delay-Doppler resolution as the number of iterations increases. © 1965-2011 IEEE.

We consider a limited feedback MU-MIMO CRN, where zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) is performed under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at a cognitive base station to mitigate both interand intranetwork interferences. To minimize the total feedback amount while satisfying the interference constraint and QoS requirements simultaneously, we propose to adaptively adjust the transmit power, select the transmission mode, and choose the feedback codebook size according to the interference constraint, CSI, and QoS requirements. The optimization problem is shown to be an integer programming problem, and we propose a heuristic algorithm that can provide an optimal solution for most practical scenarios.

84881591646	A scalable Hybrid MAC protocol for massive M2M networks	In Machine to Machine (M2M) networks, a robust Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is crucial to enable numerous machine-type devices to concurrently access the channel. Most literatures focus on developing simplex (reservation or contention based) MAC protocols which cannot provide a scalable solution for M2M networks with large number of devices. In this paper, a frame-based Hybrid MAC scheme, which consists of a contention period and a transmission period, is proposed for M2M networks. In the proposed scheme, the devices firstly contend the transmission opportunities during the contention period, only the successful devices will be assigned a time slot for transmission during the transmission period. To balance the tradeoff between the contention and transmission period in each frame, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system throughput by finding the optimal contending probability during contention period and optimal number of devices that can transmit during transmission period. A practical hybrid MAC protocol is designed to implement the proposed scheme. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Hybrid MAC protocol. © 2013 IEEE.

However, these issues as well as the solvability are less understood for networks with multiple multicast sessions. Recently, Wang and Shroff showed that the solvability of networks with two unit-rate multicast sessions (2-URMS) can be decided in polynomial time . In this paper, we prove that for the 2-URMS networks: 1) the solvability can be determined with time O(|E|);2) a solution can be constructed with time O(|E|);3) an optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial time; 4) the number of encoding links required to achieve a solution is upper-bounded by max {3,2N-2}; and 5) the field size required to achieve a linear solution is upper-bounded by max {2, √2N-7/4 + 1/2}, where |E| is the number of links and N is the number of sinks of the underlying network.

We introduce a linear resource allocation (LRA) scheme and show that most existing fairness measures can be converted to LRA with different linear coefficient vectors. We then propose the concept of strong price of fairness (SPoF) to study the network efficiency of the strong equilibrium. We show that both the SPoF and fairness measures are connected to the linear coefficient vector of LRA, which makes it possible to study the fairness and efficiency relationship.

84886701134	An efficient MAC protocol with selective grouping and cooperative sensing in cognitive radio networks	In cognitive radio (CR) networks, spectrum sensing is a crucial technique for discovering spectrum opportunities for secondary users (SUs). The quality of spectrum sensing is evaluated by both sensing accuracy and sensing efficiency. Here, sensing accuracy is represented by the false-alarm probability and the detection probability, whereas sensing efficiency is represented by the sensing overhead and network throughput. In this paper, we propose a group-based cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency. In GC-MAC, the cooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each team senses a different channel while SUs in the same team perform the joint detection on the targeted channel. The sensing process will not stop unless an available channel is discovered. To reduce the sensing overhead, an SU-selecting algorithm is presented to choose selectively the cooperative SUs based on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is built to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of channel conditions: a time-invariant channel and a time-varying channel. An optimization problem that maximizes achievable throughput is formulated to optimize the important design parameters. Both saturation and nonsaturation situations are investigated with respect to throughput and sensing overhead. Simulation results indicate that the proposed protocol is able to significantly decrease sensing overhead and increase network throughput with guaranteed sensing accuracy. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

In particular, a Max-Min user selection is proposed, which aims to harvest the multiuser diversity gain for reliable transmission in the MIMO-Y channel. The impacts of user configurations on the multiuser diversity gains are investigated by theoretical bounds as well as numerical results. It is shown that, by adding a few users in only one or two groups, the overall system performance can be improved significantly. This observation reveals an interesting behavior of MIMO-Y channel, i.e., the local configuration has a global impact. However, we prove that such asymmetrical multiuser diversity gain does not scale with the number of users. Finally, we show that multiuser diversity gain scales with the number of users if we add an equal number of users in all three groups. © 2013 IEEE.

84891500870	High-order intensity modulations for ostbc in free-space optical mimo communications	Recently, Simon-Vilnrotter and Premaratne-Zheng modified the binary pulse-position modulation (PPM) to support free-space optical (FSO) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) that requires the use of negative symbols. In this paper, we extend the investigation to optical OSTBC schemes with high-order intensity modulation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the high-order intensity modulation to maintain the orthogonality of the applied OSTBC is derived, and four Q-ary intensity modulation schemes satisfying this condition are proposed. In asynchronous FSO MIMO channels in which the signals from different transmitters arrive at the receiver with timing misalignment, the proposed modulation schemes can be used with shift-OSTBC to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and provide diversity gain. © 2013 IEEE.

84893341917	Wireless energy and information transfer tradeoff for limited-feedback multiantenna systems with energy beamforming	In this paper, we consider a multiantenna system where the receiver should harvest energy from the transmitter by wireless energy transfer to support its wireless information transmission. To maximize the harvesting energy, we propose the performance of adaptive energy beamforming according to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To help the transmitter obtain the CSI for energy beamforming, we further propose a win-win CSI quantization feedback strategy to improve the efficiencies of both power and information transmission. The focus of this paper is on the tradeoff of wireless energy and information transfer by adjusting the transfer duration with a total duration constraint. By revealing the relationship between transmit power, transfer duration, and feedback amount, we derive two wireless energy and information transfer tradeoff schemes by maximizing an upper bound and an approximate lower bound of the average information transmission rate, respectively. Moreover, the impact of imperfect CSI at the receiver is investigated, and the corresponding wireless energy and information transfer tradeoff scheme is also given. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. © 2013 IEEE.

84893224268	Delay minimization for network coded cooperative data exchange with rate adaptation	In this paper, we dynamically select the transmission rates to reduce the transmission delay required for network coded cooperative data exchange. With low transmission rate, more clients can receive the packet due to longer transmission range. However, low transmission rate may incur extra transmission delay. We consider a delay minimization with rate selection and network coding (DMRSNC) for cooperative data exchange problem under two cases: with and without packet splitting. We construct a network information flow graph to model such a problem, and design transmission strategy with the aim of minimizing transmission delay. With packet splitting, the DMRSNC problem can be formulated as a linear programming based on the graph model, which can be solved in polynomial time. When the packet splitting is not allowed, we derive an upper bound for the minimum total transmission delay required for DMRSNC problem. In addition, we derive that the upper bound is at most three times of the optimal solution in a special case. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in reducing the total transmission delay.

84893268756	Delay minimization for relay-based cooperative data exchange with network coding	In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the delay for data exchange among a group of wireless clients, where each client initially holds a subset of the packets and needs to get all the packets held by other clients. It is assumed that clients cannot communicate with each another directly, they can only exchange packets through a wireless relay. To minimize the total transmission delay during data exchange process, we need to determine at every client, which packets to be uploaded and how to encode the packets. It is also important for the relay node to decide how to encode multiple packets from different clients and select the transmission rate in the downloading process, such that every client can decode all required packets in shortest delay. We first formulate theoretically the above problem of minimizing the total transmission delay as an integer programming, and show that its complexity is NP hard. We then propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, which consists of two processes: uploading process, i.e., how to select and encode the packets from the clients to the relay, and downloading process, i.e., how the relay encode packets and select transmission rate for broadcast to all clients. For each process, theoretical formulation has been derived to minimize their transmission delay, and efficient algorithms are proposed separately. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing the total data exchange delay.

84897466324	A statistical-based algorithm for event region detection in Wireless Sensor Networks	In this paper a new method is proposed for classifying randomly deployed sensor nodes over an area of interest into distinctive categories. The problem of event region and event boundary detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is addressed. Particularly, analysis is provided for a scenario whereby an area of interest featuring two distinctive phenomena is being monitored with a randomly deployed network of wirelessly connected sensor nodes. Each sensor node in the network is asked to acknowledge whether or not it classifies itself as an event-region node based only on its own environment reading. The key decision factor employed in this approach is the statistical attributes of received signal distribution at each sensor node. Applying this algorithm results in reducing the required bandwidth for transmitting the environmental reading to the base station to be proportional to the size of the event-region. This is opposed to other approaches where the required bandwidth is proportional to the size of the entire network. © 2013 IEEE.

84898978285	Ergodic capacity analysis of dual-hop ZF/MRT relaying systems with co-channel interference	In this paper, we analyze the ergodic capacity of dual-hop amplify-and-forward systems where the relay node is equipped with multiple antennas and subject to co-channel interference (CCI) and the additive white Gaussian noise. Specifically, we consider a heuristic precoding scheme, where the relay node first applies the zero-forcing principle to eliminate the interference, and then steers the signal towards the destination with the maximum ratio transmission scheme. Two separate power constraints are investigated, namely, the short-term/long-term power constraint. New exact closed-form ergodic capacity expressions are derived for both cases. It is demonstrated that the short-term power constraint case only achieves a slightly higher capacity, indicating that the long-term power constraint maybe preferred in practice as it requires less control and incurs smaller overhead. In addition, the coupled effect of the number of antennas N and number of interferers M is examined. Our findings show that a slight change in N or M does not cause a significant variation of the ergodic capacity when the difference between N andM is large. On the other hand, when the difference between N and M is small, a slight change in N or M results in a substantial variation of the ergodic capacity.

84899047792	QoS-driven robust beamforming and power allocation in rateless network coded two-way relaying systems	In this paper, we consider a two-way relaying system where two source nodes communicate with the aid of a multiantenna relay. In order to improve spectrum efficiency and enhance transmission reliability simultaneously, a transmission scheme of network coding combining with rateless coding is designed for this relaying system. Distinct from traditional amplifying-forward (AF) and decoding-forward (DF) relaying schemes, our proposed scheme just applies a soft decision to the mixed signal at the relay, leading to a low computation complexity. Moreover, to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements of both source nodes with minimal power, a beamforming design method is proposed by effectively exploiting the spatial degree of freedom at the multiantenna relay. Furthermore, considering the imperfect channel state information (CSI) in practical systems, a robust beamforming design method is presented accordingly. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our theoretical claims. © 2013 IEEE.

84899912375	Outage probability of dual-hop multiple antenna AF systems with linear processing in the presence of co-channel interference	This paper considers a dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system where the relay is equipped with multiple antennas, while the source and the destination are equipped with a single antenna. Assuming that the relay is subjected to co-channel interference (CCI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) while the destination is corrupted by AWGN only, we propose three heuristic relay precoding schemes to combat the CCI, namely, 1) Maximum ratio combining/maximal ratio transmission (MRC/MRT), 2) Zero-forcing/MRT (ZF/MRT), 3) Minimum mean-square error/MRT (MMSE/MRT). We derive new exact outage expressions as well as simple high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage approximations for all three schemes. Our findings suggest that both the MRC/MRT and the MMSE/MRT schemes achieve a full diversity of N, while the ZF/MRT scheme achieves a diversity order of N-M, where N is the number of relay antennas and M is the number of interferers. In addition, we show that the MMSE/MRT scheme always achieves the best outage performance, and the ZF/MRT scheme outperforms the MRC/MRT scheme in the low SNR regime, while becomes inferior to the MRC/MRT scheme in the high SNR regime. Finally, in the large N regime, we show that both the ZF/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes are capable of completely eliminating the CCI, while perfect interference cancelation is not possible with the MRC/MRT scheme. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

84902177309	Spectrum sharing for device-to-device communications in cellular networks: A game theoretic approach	This paper studies the spectrum sharing problem between device-to-device (D2D) and cellular communications in a cellular network. In this network, the D2D links can access the spectrum controlled by a mobile network operator. Each D2D link can either access the sub-bands occupied by cellular subscribers or obtain a sub-band for its exclusive use. The D2D links with exclusive use of sub-bands can also share spectrum with each other. We observe that the above spectrum sharing problem is complex and there may not exist a stable spectrum sharing structure. We establish a hierarchical matching market with incomplete information to model and analyze the above D2D spectrum sharing problem. In our model, each D2D link is selfish and autonomous. We seek a Bayesian equilibrium of our market that achieves a stable spectrum sharing structure among all the D2D links. We derive a sufficient condition for which the Bayesian equilibrium exists. We propose a distributed algorithm which can detect whether this sufficient condition is satisfied and, if satisfied, achieve the Bayesian equilibrium. Our algorithm does not require each D2D link to know the payoffs of others and has the worst case complexity of O(L

84902965131	Distributed scheduling achieves the optimal multiuser diversity gain for MIMO-Y channel	A distributed user scheduling scheme is proposed to harvest multiuser diversity (MuD) for the MIMO-Y channel. A three-party information exchange model is considered, where three representatives are selected from three clusters of users to exchange information via a fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. In particular, a novel MIMO-Y transmission scheme is proposed with the reference signal space (RSS), which enables the distributed transmit/receive beamforming and scheduling of the users. It is shown that the proposed distributed scheduling achieves the same MuD gain as the optimal centralized one, while significantly reducing the complexity and feedback. Moreover, the outage probability of the proposed scheme is quantified, and the achievable MuD gain is shown to be the minimum number of candidates in the three clusters. Finally, numerical results validate our theoretical derivations. © 2013 IEEE.

84902968716	Coding-based data broadcasting for time-critical applications with rate adaptation	In this paper, we dynamically select the transmission rate and design wireless network coding to improve the quality of services, such as delay for time-critical applications. In a network coded system, with a low transmission rate and, hence, a longer transmission range, more packets may be encoded, which increases the coding opportunity. However, a low transmission rate may incur extra transmission delay, which is intolerable for time-critical applications. We design a novel joint rate selection and wireless network coding (RSNC) scheme with a delay constraint to maximize the total benefit (where we can define the benefit based on the priority or importance of a packet for example) of the packets that are successfully received at the destinations without missing their deadlines. We prove that the proposed problem is NP-hard and propose a novel graph model to mathematically formulate the problem. For the general case, we propose a transmission metric and design an efficient algorithm to determine the transmission rate and coding strategy for each transmission. For a special case when all delay constraints are the same, we study pairwise coding and present a polynomial-time pairwise coding algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of 1 - (1/e) to the optimal pairwise coding solution, where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RSNC scheme. © 2013 IEEE.

84903608029	Adaptive mode selection in multiuser MISO cognitive networks with limited cooperation and feedback	In this paper, we consider a multiuser (MU) multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink cognitive network coexisting with a primary network. With the purpose of exploiting the spatial degree of freedom to counteract the internetwork interference and intranetwork (interuser) interference simultaneously, we propose performing zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) at the multiantenna cognitive base station (BS) based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). The challenge of designing ZFBF in cognitive networks lies in how to obtain the interference CSI. To solve it, we introduce a limited internetwork cooperation protocol, namely, the quantized CSI conveyance from the primary receiver to the cognitive BS via purchase. Clearly, the more the feedback amount, the better the performance, but the higher the feedback cost. To achieve a balance between the performance and feedback cost, we take the maximization of the feedback utility function (FUF), which is defined as the difference of the average sum rate and feedback cost while satisfying the interference constraint, as the optimization objective, and derive the transmission mode and feedback amount joint optimization scheme. Moreover, we quantitatively investigate the impact of CSI feedback delay and obtain the corresponding optimization scheme. Furthermore, through asymptotic analysis, we present some simple schemes. Finally, numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our theoretical claims. © 2013 IEEE.

84903318738	TRADER: A reliable transmission scheme to video conferencing applications over the internet	In this paper, we investigate the problem of packet transmissions in real-time video conferencing from a single source to multiple destinations. To overcome the burst path losses over the Internet, we propose a transmission scheme dubbed TRAding DElay for Reliability (TRADER), which appropriately spreads out the FEC (Forward Error Correction) packets departures with respect to the delay constraint. The network measurements from a video conferencing system and the PlanetLab demonstrate that the transmission delays to different destinations mainly differ by 100-250 ms. Motivated by this observation, we present a mathematical formulation and a systematic design to effectively leverage the delay differences for optimizing the receivers video quality. The superiority of TRADER over existing transmission schemes is analyzed based on Gilbert model and continuous time Markov chain. We conduct performance evaluation via semi-physical emulations in Exata and experimental results show that TRADER outperforms the previous approaches in improving video quality in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84904438333	Super-resolution sparse MIMO-OFDM channel estimation based on spatial and temporal correlations	This letter proposes a parametric sparse multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-OFDM channel estimation scheme based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) theory, whereby super-resolution estimates of path delays with arbitrary values can be achieved. Meanwhile, both the spatial and temporal correlations of wireless MIMO channels are exploited to improve the accuracy of the channel estimation. For outdoor communication scenarios, where wireless channels are sparse in nature, path delays of different transmit-receive antenna pairs share a common sparse pattern due to the spatial correlation of MIMO channels. Meanwhile, the channel sparse pattern is nearly unchanged during several adjacent OFDM symbols due to the temporal correlation of MIMO channels. By simultaneously exploiting those MIMO channel characteristics, the proposed scheme performs better than existing state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, by joint processing of signals associated with different antennas, the pilot overhead can be reduced under the framework of the FRI theory. © 2014 IEEE.

Specifically, we consider three heuristic precoding schemes, where the relay first applies the: 1) maximal-ratio combining (MRC); 2) zero-forcing (ZF); and 3) minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) principle to combine the signal from the source, and then steers the transformed signal toward the destination with the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) technique. For the MRC/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes, we present new tight analytical upper and lower bounds for the ergodic capacity, while for the ZF/MRT scheme, we derive a new exact analytical ergodic capacity expression. Moreover, we make a comparison among all three schemes, and our results reveal that, in terms of the ergodic capacity performance, the MMSE/MRT scheme always has the best performance and the ZF/MRT scheme is slightly inferior, while the MRC/MRT scheme is always the worst one. Finally, the asymptotic behavior of ergodic capacity for the three proposed schemes are characterized in large $N$ scenario, where $N$ is the number of relay antennas. Our results reveal that, in the large $N$ regime, both the ZF/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes have perfect interference cancelation capability, which is not possible with the MRC/MRT scheme. © 2014 IEEE.

In particular, the proposed DUS is based on the individual performance metric calculated by each user with its local channel state information (CSI). Therefore, DUS bypasses global CSI and complicated computations at the scheduling center, both are often inevitable with traditional centralized user scheduling (CUS). Furthermore, the outage performance of DUS is analyzed and the achievable multi-user diversity (MuD) order is derived. Numerical results validate the theoretical derivations and show that DUS achieves comparable performances to CUS in the considered scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.

In this paper, a RSS-based localization algorithm, which jointly takes into consideration the effect of channel sight conditions, is investigated. In our approach, the channel sight conditions experience by a moving target to all sensors is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM), with the quantized measured RSSs as its observation. The parameters of HMM are obtained by an off-line training assuming that the LOS/NLOS can be identified during the training phase. With the HMM matrices, a forward-only algorithm can be utilized for real time sight conditions identification. The target is localized by extended Kalman Filter (EKF) by suitably combining with the sight conditions. Simulation results show that our proposed localization strategy can provide good identification to channel sight conditions, hence results in a better localization estimation. © 2014 IEEE.

For the considered scenario, a novel intra-cell performance aware opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) scheme is proposed to mitigate the inter-cell interference while reducing the intra-cell power loss caused by zero-forcing receiving. Unlike the traditional OIA schemes, the proposed scheme reuses the reference signal subspace (RSS) to balance not only the inter-cell interference but also the desired signal power and the intra-cell power leakage. It is shown that the refined selection further improves the achievable sum rate as compared to the existing schemes, and this observation is theoretically analyzed.

84913525998	Design of a scalable hybrid MAC protocol for heterogeneous M2M networks	A robust and resilient medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial for numerous machine-type devices to concurrently access the channel in a machine-to-machine (M2M) network. Simplex (reservation- or contention-based) MAC protocols are studied in most literatures which may not be able to provide a scalable solution for M2M networks with large number of heterogeneous devices. In this paper, a scalable hybrid MAC protocol, which consists of a contention period and a transmission period, is designed for heterogeneous M2M networks. In this protocol, different devices with preset priorities (hierarchical contending probabilities) first contend the transmission opportunities following the convention-based p-persistent carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism. Only the successful devices will be assigned a time slot for transmission following the reservation-based time-division multiple access (TDMA) mechanism. If the devices failed in contention at previous frame, to ensure the fairness among all devices, their contending priorities will be raised by increasing their contending probabilities at the next frame. To balance the tradeoff between the contention and transmission period in each frame, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the channel utility by finding the key design parameters: the contention duration, initial contending probability, and the incremental indicator. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid MAC protocol.

This can be done through shifting consumption to off-peak hours and thus reducing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the electricity system. In this paper, we begin by proposing a demand-side energy consumption scheduling scheme for household appliances that considers a PAR constraint. An initial optimization problem is formulated to minimize the energy cost of the consumers through the determination of the optimal usage power and operation time of throttleable and shiftable appliances, respectively. We realize that the acceptance of consumers of these load management schemes is crucial to its success. Hence, we then introduce a multi-objective optimization problem which not only minimizes the energy cost but also minimizes the inconvenience posed to consumers. In addition to solving the proposed optimization problems in a centralized manner, two distributed algorithms for the initial and the multi-objective optimization problems are also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed demand-side energy consumption schedule can provide an effective approach to reducing total energy costs while simultaneously considering PAR constraints and consumers' preferences.

Every user harvests energy from the HAP in the downlink to support its uplink information transmission. The downlink and uplink channels between the HAP and users are modeled as fading channels with different spatial correlations. We assume that only statistical channel state information is available at the transmitter. First, we obtain the optimal time slot allocation strategy to maximize the ergodic sum-rate for the no-correlation scenario. Then, for the general correlation scenario, we provide highly effective solutions by determining the appropriate time slot allocation, covariance matrix of the transmitted energy signal at the HAP, and covariance matrix of the transmitted information signal at each user.

We show that the DOF of this particular scenario is 1.5. In order to prove this result, we firstly derive a DOF upper bound based on cut-set bound by allowing cooperation among users, which shows that the total DOF is upper bounded by 1.5. Then we propose a novel transmission scheme based on asymmetric signal space alignment (ASSA) to demonstrate the achievability of the upper bound. Theoretical evaluation and numerical results confirm that the upper bound can be achieved by utilizing ASSA, which also proves the optimality of the ASSA-based scheme in terms of DOF. Combining the upper bound and achievability, we conclude that the exact DOF is 1.5. Moreover, we present a novel iterative joint beamforming optimization (I-JBO) algorithm to further improve the sum rate. Numerical simulations have been provided to demonstrate the convergence speed and performance advantage of the I-JBO algorithm.

The large number of antenna elements in LS-MIMO system is exploited to enhance transmission security and improve system performance, especially when the eavesdropper is closer to the information source and has more antennas than the legitimate user. However, in practical systems, the problem becomes challenging because the eavesdropper channel state information (CSI) is usually unavailable without cooperation and the legitimate CSI may be imperfect due to channel estimation error. In this paper, we first analyze the performance of physical layer security without eavesdropper CSI and with imperfect legitimate CSI, and then propose an energy-efficient power allocation scheme to meet the demand for wireless security and quality of service (QoS) simultaneously.

Coordinated beamforming is employed to mitigate the interference, including intra-cell and inter-cell interference. However, due to the limited capacity of the backhaul link, only partial channel state information (CSI) is obtained at the base stations (BSs), resulting in residual interference even with coordinated beamforming.

84924365503	To migrate or to wait: Delay-cost tradeoff for cloud data centers	To upgrade the systems or fix the security issues, some physical machines (PMs) in data centers are required to undergo a maintenance process, which might disable the continuous services of the virtual machines (VMs) run on them for a few time slots. To reduce the waiting delay, one may migrate the VMs to other active PMs. However, it will incur extra migration cost, e.g., bandwidth or memory used to move data. To balance the tradeoff between delay and migration cost, we formulate a two-objective optimization problem, which minimizes both delay and migration cost according to a certain weightage, so as to decide whether the VMs should be migrated to other active PMs or should wait their own maintained PMs to be back. We first prove that the proposed problem is NP-hard. For a special case, where each VM requires the same size of resource, we show that the defined problem can be converted to minimum weighted bipartite matching problem in an auxiliary bipartite graph. A lower bound of the delay is derived for a specific setting. For the general case of the problem, we also design an efficient heuristic algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

The main objective is to encourage EUs with small distributed energy resources (DERs), or with high sensitivity to their inconvenience, to take part in the energy trading via providing incentive to them with relatively higher payment at the same time as reducing the total cost to the energy controller. The proposed scheme is modeled through a two-stage Stackelberg game that describes the energy trading between a shared facility authority (SFA) and EUs in a smart community. A suitable cost function is proposed for the SFA to leverage the generation of discriminate pricing according to the inconvenience experienced by each EU. It is shown that the game has a unique sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE), under the certain condition at which the SFA's total cost is minimized, and that each EU receives its best utility according to its associated inconvenience for the given price. A backward induction technique is used to derive a closed form expression for the price function at SPE, and thus the dependency of price on an EU's different decision parameters is explained for the studied system. Numerical examples are provided to show the beneficial properties of the proposed scheme.
