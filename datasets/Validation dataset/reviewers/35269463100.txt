84930965818	Gas transfer velocities of methane and carbon dioxide in a subtropical shallow pond	Two diel field campaigns under different weather patterns were carried out in the summer and autumn of 2013 to measure CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes and to probe the rates of gas exchange across the air-water interface in a subtropical eutrophic pond in China. Bubble emissions of CH<inf>4</inf> accounted for 99.7 and 91.67% of the total CH<inf>4</inf> emission measured at two sites in the summer; however, no bubblewas observed in the autumn.The pondwas supersaturated with CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> during themonitoring period, and the saturation ratios (i.e. observed concentration/equilibrium concentration) of CH<inf>4</inf> were much higher than that of CO<inf>2</inf>. Although the concentration of dissolved CO<inf>2</inf> in the surface water collected in the autumn was 1.24 times of that in the summer, the mean diffusive CO<inf>2</inf> flux across the water-air interface measured in the summer is almost twice compared with that in the autumn. The mean concentration of dissolved CH<inf>4</inf> in the surface water in the autumn was around half of that in the summer, but the mean diffusive CH<inf>4</inf> flux in the summer is 4-5 times of that in the autumn. Our data showed that the variation in gas exchange rate was dominated by differences in weather patterns and primary production. Averaged k<inf>600</inf>-CO<inf>2</inf> and k<inf>600</inf>-CH<inf>4</inf> (the gas transfer velocity normalised to a Schmidt number of 600)were 0.65 and 0.55 cm/h in the autumn, and 2.83 and 1.64cm/h in the summer, respectively. No statistically significant correlation was found between k<inf>600</inf> and U<inf>10</inf> (wind speed at 10mheight) in the summer at lowwind speeds in clearweather.Diffusive gas fluxes increased during the nights, which resulted from the nighttime cooling effect of water surface and stronger turbulent mixing in the water column. The chemical enhancements for CO<inf>2</inf> were estimated up to 1.94-fold in the hot and clear summer with low wind speeds, which might have been resulted from the increasing hydration reactions in water due to the high water temperature and active metabolism in planktonic algae. However, both the air and surface water temperatures decreased continually, and relatively lower temperature and overcast weather with occasionally light rain dominated the second campaign in the autumn. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the surfacewater and U10 controlled gas transfer velocities of CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf>, respectively, in the cool autumn. When the surface water temperaturewas higher than the air temperature, higher CO<inf>2</inf> fluxwas observed because thewater bodywas unstable and overturned quickly, inducing quick CO<inf>2</inf> emitted from plankton algae in surface water to the atmosphere.

84939785495	An investigation on summer algal blooms in Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir	Taking Xiangxi River, a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir as the study object, and according to the monitoring data obtained in summer of 2011, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of nutrients and chlorophyll a in the tributary bay before and after an algal bloom, and their relevance were analyzed. The results showed that the algal bloom lasted during June 21-29, 2011, and the maximal value of chlorophyll a achieved 125. 8 mg · m<sup>-3</sup>. The algal bloom had a significant influence on the spatial distribution of DIN and DIP, and the nutrients were at high concentrations in middle reaches, and low concentrations in the estuary, but diminished from the estuary to the upper reaches, and sharply declined in the algal bloom area. The high background concentrations of nutrients in Yangtze River increased the risk of algal blooms in the tributary bay. The outflow position of the Yangtze River water with high background concentrations of nutrients in the Xiangxi River bay was just the region with the most severe algal bloom. The nutrient supply of mainstream water to the tributary bay surface water was the key factor affecting the algal bloom fluctuation.

84940326379	Feeding behaviors of darkbarbel catfish (Peletobagrus vachelli Riehardson) in spawning ground of Chinese sturgeon in lower reaches of Gezhouba Dam, China: A laboratory study	Darkbarbel catfish (Peletobagrus vachelli) is one of the major predatory fishes feeding on the eggs of Chinese sturgeon. In this paper, the wild darkbarbel catfish population (body length 14.34±5.16 cm, body mass 61.29±23.62 g) was collected from the lower reaches of Gezhouba Dam, and a laboratory experiment was conducted to study the feeding preference, locomotion, and feeding circadian rhythm of the population under the conditions of natural day/ night rhythm and water temperature 20.6 ±0.5 °Cand with the baits of earthworm (Pheretima sp.), commercial pellet, dried tofu, fish (Pseudorasbora parva), shrimp (Macrobranchium nipponense), and sweet potato, aimed to search for the countermeasures to reduce the predation of darkbarbel catfish on the eggs of Chinese sturgeon. No significant differences were observed in the percentages of the preference to the six kinds of baits, but the feeding rate of darkbarbel catfish on earthworm, fish, and shrimp was significantly higher than that on tofu, sweet potato, and commercial pellet. Under no bait addition, the locomotion level of the darkbarbel catfish could be defined as active period (18:00-22:00), sub-active period (22:00-7:00), and non-active period (7:00-18:00), with significant differences among the three periods. Under bait addition, the locomotion level of the darkbarbel catfish could be defined as activity period (18:00-5:00) and non-activity period (5:00-18:00), with significant differences between the two periods. The feeding activity level of the darkbarbel catfish was classified into feeding period (17:00-5:00) and non-feeding period (5:00-17:00), with significant differences between the two periods. It was concluded that darkbarbel catfish preferred to feed earthworm, fish, and shrimp, and the locomotion and feeding rhythms of the darkbarbel catfish were of nocturnal, with the locomotion level disturbed by baits.

14844364046	Displacement-controlled method and its applications to material non-linearity	For the analysis of non-linear problems, the displacement-controlled method (DCM) has a more extensive application scope and more powerful abilities than the load-controlled method (LCM). However, difficulties of the DCM's procedure not amenable to most finite element implementations of the conventional LCM have restricted its applications in geomechanics. By means of Sherman-Morrison's theorem, the solution of DCM is improved. The improved procedure is characterized by high efficiency, good numerical stability and a programme structure similar to LCM. Two aspects of applications of DCM are illustrated. The first application is to compute the response of a structure under a given load level like the conventional finite element analysis. The second application is to trace the equilibrium path of a structure under a given load distribution type. A simple but effective algorithm is presented for automatically adjusting the step length in tracing the equilibrium path. Examples illustrate that the proposed procedures are suited for modelling complicated non-linear problems in geomechanics. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

15344339061	Dam made of cables and concrete plate elements (cable-plate dam)	A new kind of "slim and thin" dam named cable-plate dam is put forward in this paper. This type of dam consists of cables and plates. The cables are made of high strength materials and anchored into both sides of riverside hill slope. And the plates are made of fiber reinforced materials and fixed on cables. As the whole body of dam is flexible and its stability relies on both sides of river valley cables anchored on. There are only tensile stresses exiting in dam body when dam is taken into use. When floods happens the dam can discharge water through it's body or over its top. The average thickness of dam is about several centimeters and as a result the needed local materials and excavation are fewer than common dams. Therefore, this kind of dam will hardly damage the natural environment of dam region. And it is feasible in technology and in economy. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

15344351620	Multi-objective linear programming method of optimizing foundation deformation modulus for high arch dam	The good deformation characters of foundation are severely requested when a high dam especially high arch dam is constructed on the foundation. But it does not mean the higher modulus the better working condition of arch dam. It is a big difficult problem for designers to rationally make a design which not only does good to the stress, stability and deformation for arch dam, but also can save a large sum of money on treating foundation through man-made methods. This paper establishes an optimization model for multi-objective linear programming of deformation modulus for arch dam foundation based on the unit deformation modulus method for calculating the stress of arch dam. In the optimization model, the deformation modulus E which varies with different elevation for arch dam foundation is chosen as design variable and through using multi-objective linear programming method the optimal deformation modulus is solved which on the one hand avails the best working condition of arch dam and on the other can reduce the treatment costs to the minimum within the value bound of deformation modulus that artificial methods can reach. The model created in this paper is used to solve the optimal deformation modulus of a high arch dam in China. The calculated results indicate that the optimization model is reasonable and practical and also provides strong technique support to designers and foundation treatment. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

The proposed mixed finite element solution can overcome some numerical difficulties encountered in the analysis of contact problems in geomechanics. These difficulties include contact of large area, non-smooth contact, alleviation of ill-condition and treatment of rigid displacements. The well-posed issue of the formulation and a criterion for judging collapse of the system are also discussed in detail. The paper then presents two simple examples and a very challenging example from the shiplock of the Three Gorges Project in construction. These examples illustrate that the proposed mixed finite element solution is robust and suitable for solving interface problems encountered in geomechanics. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

23044472123	Definitions of safety factor of slope stability analysis with finite element method	There exist three definitions of safety factor in slope stability analyses by limit equilibrium methods (LEM). Definition 1 defines the safety factor as the ratio of the shear strength of soil to the shear stress required for equilibrium. Definition 2 defines the margin of safety factor as the factor of the strength reduction, by which the shear strength of the soil would have to be divided to bring the slope into a state of critical equilibrium. Definition 3 defines the safety factor as the ratio of the resistant shear force to the driving shear force along a certain slip surface. This study discusses the relation between Definition 1 and 3. A unified algorithm is given, which is used to locate the critical slip lines corresponding to Definition 3 and Definition 2 respectively. It is also proved while the finite element method is used to analyze slope stability, both the safety factor and the potential slip surface based on Definition 3 are different from those on Definition 2. Some irrational results might be obtained if Definition 3 is used in finite element slope stability analysis.

28844459120	Slope stability analysis based on elasto-plastic finite element method	The paper deals with two essential and related closely processes involved in the finite element slope stability analysis in two-dimensional problems, i.e. computation of the factors of safety (FOS) and location of the critical slide surfaces. A so-called φ-v inequality, sin φ ≥ 1 - 2v is proved for any elasto-plastic material satisfying Mohr-Coulomb's yield criterion. In order to obtain an FOS of high precision with less calculation and a proper distribution of plastic zones in the critical equilibrium state, it is stated that the Poisson's ratio v should be adjusted according to the principle that the φ-v inequality always holds as reducing the strength parameters c and φ. While locating the critical slide surface represented by the critical slide line (CSL) under the plane strain condition, an initial value problem of a system of ordinary differential equations defining the CSL is formulated. A robust numerical solution for the initial value problem based on the predictor-corrector method is given in conjunction with the necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of solution. A simple example, the kinematic solution of which is available, and a challenging example from a hydraulic project in construction are analysed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures.

3142530766	Finite element analysis on landslide mechanism at Shiliushubao	The landslide at Shiliushubao is a part of the Huanglashi landslide, a very important ancient landslide in Three Gorges Dam's headpond. Analyses are conducted on the mechanism of landslide by means of FEA based on the displacement-controlled method. In case that the slide surface is known, the study illustrates the application of the Katona contact element to modeling sliding surface. As comparison, another computation scheme is set, in which the sliding body is of the property of soil in the sliding band and there is no contact interface between the rock bed and the sliding body. In two manners, the safety factors are approximate but the failure mechanisms are quite different. This states that the property of soil in the sliding band controls the stability of landslide. The study also explains the reason why the safety factors obtained by conventional FEM are different from those by limit equilibrium methods.

33745636520	On two definitions of the factor of safety commonly used in the finite element slope stability analysis	In the 2D finite element slope stability analysis, there are two commonly used definitions on the factor of safety. The first is the strength reserving definition, which defines the factor of safety as the factor by which the shear strength of the soil would have to be divided to bring the slope into the state of critical equilibrium. The second is the overloading definition, which defines the factor of safety as the ratio of total resisting forces to total driving forces along a certain slip line. This study formulates a uniform initial value problem of ordinary differential equations for locating the critical slip lines corresponding to the two definitions and proposes a prediction-correction procedure for the initial value problem. Through solving the relevant initial value problem, the critical slip line can be located without specifying its shape and location. It is also demonstrated that while the finite element method is utilized for analyzing slope stability, the critical slip lines based on the overloading definition might be for the most part shallower than those by the strength reserving definition and the conventional limit equilibrium methods, and hence the design based on the overloading definition might be precarious. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33751561875	Direct solution of near-symmetric matrices and its applications	By a near-symmetric matrix, we mean that only a very few of entries in the matrix are non-symmetric. If those non-symmetric entries above the diagonal are replaced with the corresponding entries below the diagonal, it will become symmetric. Such a matrix can be encountered in the analysis of nonlinear continuum problems. Based on Sherman-Morrison's formula, a new scheme for decomposing near-symmetric matrices is proposed, which is much more effective and less memory-used than those solvers for common sparse non-symmetric matrices under the condition that the numerical stability is assured. Moreover, the solver corresponding to the scheme, which is suitable for both symmetric and non-symmetric matrices, can be developed through slightly augmenting the solvers based on LDL

Adopting flexibility to measure stiffness of bedding rock slope, we can achieve the relation between mechanical model, failure character and critical slope length of bedding rock slope. If the value of flexibility is smaller than critical flexibility, bedding rock slope can be simplified to pole model. If the value of flexibility is greater than critical flexibility, bedding rock slope can be simplified to pole or girder model according to actual slope length; and buckling failure of bedding rock slope happens only under special condition.

34047247063	Numerical simulation of orthotropic anisotropic damage considering rock-water interaction	An orthotropic anisotropic elastic damage model has been proposed, and the elastic deformation, damage deformation and other irreversible deformation can be identified respectively. A second rank damage tensor is used to characterize the induced damage with damage evolution being related to the propagation criteria of microcracks. A specific form of the Gibbs free energy function is used to obtain the effective elastic stiffness, and the limited scopes of relative anisotropic damage parameters are suggested based on the energy principle. A method for determining of all parameters of the anisotropic damage model is proposed by virtue of conventional biaxial test. The mechanical behaviors of different loading paths are described, such as proportional loading, lateral unloading; while the comparison between test data and numerical simulations shows an overall good agreement. Then, the anisotropic damage model is extended to describe the hydro-mechanical behaviors to simulate the coupled hydro-mechanical responses in different loading paths. The numerical results show that the proposed and extended model is suited to describe the main features of hydro-mechanical behaviors of rock.

34548514857	Discussion on multiple solution of safety factor of a slope	The calculated value of safety factor of a slope directly determines the design of slope engineering. However, the limit equilibrium method can not yield a single value of safety factor; thus the study of multiple solution of safety factor helps in justifying the reasonableness of the computation results and selecting the range of possible values of safety factor. The initial distribution of normal stresses over the slip surface is assumed, which is then modified by a Lagrangian function involving three parameters to satisfy the complete equilibrium conditions of the sliding body. Solving the equilibrium equations yields values of the three parameters associated with a series of prescribed safety factors, and the reasonable range of safety factor of a slope is justified according the reasonableness of the normal stress distribution over the slip surface. Example studies show that the reasonable range of safety factor for a circular slip surface is within 5%; however, for non-circular slip surfaces, this range would be as large as 15%.

The proposed method enjoys excellent numerical properties and can be easily generalized to the three-dimensional situations in which all the six equilibrium conditions can be satisfied. This study demonstrates the application of the procedure to two-dimensional situations.

Since the impounding of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China in 2003, the hydraulic conditions and aquatic environment of the Xiangxi Bay (XXB) have changed significantly. The resulting emergence of eutrophication and algal blooms leads to its deteriorated water quality. The XXB becomes an ideal case study area. Thus, a simulation-based inexact chance-constrained nonlinear programming (SICNP) model is developed and applied to eutrophication control planning in the XXB of the TGR under uncertainties. In the SICNP, the wastewater treatment costs for removing total phosphorus (TP) are set as the objective function; effluent discharge standards, stream water quality standards and eutrophication control standards are considered in the constraints; a steady-state simulation model for phosphorus transport and fate is embedded in the environmental standards constraints; the interval programming and chance-constrained approaches are integrated to provide interval decision variables but also the associated risk levels in violating the system constraints. The model results indicate that changes in the violating level (q) will result in different strategy distributions at spatial and temporal scales; the optimal value of cost objective is from [2.74, 13.41] million RMB to [2.25, 13.08] million RMB when q equals from 0.01 to 0.25; the required TP treatment efficiency for the Baisha plant is the most stringent, which is followed by the Xiakou Town and the Zhaojun Town, while the requirement for the Pingyikou cement plant is the least stringent.

The material properties used in grouting and two methods for crack repair were discussed in details, and consequently reliable repair measures were proposed and implemented. It is a better choice to adopt the hole-drilling method for the relatively regular crack. The grouting pressure should not be too high and it is generally between 0.4-0.6 MPa. For the second time grouting, the pressure maybe increased to 0.8 MPa. Other method is the pasting nozzles method which is more suitable for irregular cracks such as cracks with intensive density and crossing cracks. Its grouting pressure is generally between 0.6-1.0 MPa. The in-situ tests in Three Gorges Project demonstrate favorably the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods for crack repair within the lining concrete.

Singularity of the seepage point is accordingly eliminated. A strategy is developed for overcoming the mesh-dependency in the finite element implementation. © 2007.

Based on the observation that the critical slip surface will be within the plastic zone and be composed of the points at which the equivalent plastic strain arrives at the maximum in the vertical direction. First, some vertical lines are arranged along the horizontal direction. Then, along each of the vertical lines the point with the maximum equivalent plastic strain is found out. All such points take on a shape of wave and form the functional data. Finally, the functional data are smoothed by the least squares and the position of the critical slip surface is determined.

Confining pressure values of 0, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 MPa are used on the C30 concrete specimens, Confining pressure values 0, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32 MPa are used on the C40 concrete ones; The concrete specimen is loaded by the classified sinusoidal forces under displacement control mode. The expression of the stressstrain curve is chosen and analyzed, the correlation of the material parameters and the factors is analyzed. The results show that the formula parameter of stress-strain curve using for the SFRC under static force presented by Ezeldin is modified, the modified model have provides a good description of the stress-strain curve of the SFRC under the three-axis dynamic compression. The higher fiber content is the more significant role to improve the dynamic compressive strength, but under pressure the fiber content less improves the dynamic strength of concrete. Dynamic peak stress of concrete is sensitive to the confining pressure, and the sensitivity decreases with the increasing of strength. The peak strain correlated to the various factors is basically the same as the peak stress. Under the dynamic load the relationship between the secant elasticity modulus, the steel fiber content and secant modulus of SFRC is improved with the increase of the concrete strength. Confining pressure and fiber content of concrete have not much impact to the index toughness on the state of compression.

The confining pressure values of 0, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 MPa were used on the C30 concrete specimens, the confining pressure values of 0, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32 MPa were used on the C40 concrete specimens; The concrete specimen is loaded in certain sine-wave pressures in axis grade by grade.

65749118750	Effect of the stirrup on cracking of concrete cover due to reinforcement corrosion	Considering the change of the spacing and diameter of stirrups, a corrosion-induced cracking module for concrete members is built by ANSYS. The effect of the stirrup on cracking of concrete cover due to longitudinal reinforcement corrosion is analyzed, and the following conclusions are reached. The peak value of the corrosion pressure inducing longitudinal crack is influenced slightly by spacing of stirrups over 100 mm, but the position of cracks is influenced remarkably. In fact, cracks appear firstly at the location of stirrups with less possibility, but it shows high possibility that cracks appear between two adjacent stirrups. The longitudinal crack initiation due to corrosion of reinforcement can be prevented or postponed effectively by stirrups spacing in 50mm. The concrete cover-cracking is influenced slightly by the diameter of stirrups.

70449394493	Multi-objective non-linear programming method of optimizing foundation deformation modulus for Jinping high arch dam	The good deformation characters of foundation are severely requested when a high dam especially high arch dam is constructed on the foundation. But it doesn't mean the higher modulus the better working condition of arch dam. It is a big difficult problem for designers to rationally make a design which not only does well to the stress, stability and deformation for arch dam, but also can save a large sum of money on treating foundation through man-made methods. This paper establishes an optimization model for multi-objective non-linear programming of deformation modulus for arch dam foundation based on the unit deformation modulus method for calculating the stress of arch dam. In the optimization model, the deformation modulus E which varies with different elevation for arch dam foundation is chosen as design variable and through using multi-objective non-linear programming method the optimal deformation modulus is solved which on the one hand avails the best working condition of arch dam and on the other can reduce the treatment costs to the minimum within the value bound of deformation modulus that artificial methods can reach. The model created in this paper is used to solve the optimal deformation modulus of Jinping arch dam, the tallest high arch dam both in China and in the world. The calculated results indicate that the optimization model is reasonable and practical and also provides strong technique support to designers and foundation treatment. © 2009 IEEE.

73349143295	Experimental study of the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on fish growth	To find out the appropriate hydrodynamic conditions for fish growth is an important issue in present eco-hydraulic research. The experimental study presented here is to investigate the effect of the hydrodynamic conditions on fish growth. Especially, the Carassius auratus is chosen here for the case study through taking segmentation experiments in the graded ring shape flume. The detailed hydrodynamic characteristics of flumes which are relevant to fish growth are obtained through the 3D numerical simulation of the flume's flow field. Compared with the simulation results and the on-site measurements, the simulation is shown to be reliable. Combining the relative daily growth rate of Carassius auratus with the flow detail characteristics which are quantized by three hydrodynamic characteristic variables including flow velocity, velocity gradient and kinetic energy gradient, the quantitative relationship is established between the fish growth and the hydrodynamic characteristic variables. There is a short-term effect of flow velocity stress on the growth of Carassius auratus, and 0.2 m/s is a very feasible velocity for the growth of Carassius auratus. A negative correlation is found between the relative daily growth rate and the kinetic energy gradient with the relative daily growth rate decreasing with the increase of kinetic energy. The threshold of kinetic energy gradient of the growth of Carassius auratus is 0.009 J/(kg·m). The quantification of the hydrodynamic conditions of fish growth can provide the quantitative basis for the ecological water conservancy planning.

A major barrier to water pollution forecasting is the lack of an efficient system for water pollution monitoring. Traditional water pollution sampling is time-consuming, expensive, and can only be taken for small sizes. 3S technique provides a new technique to monitor water pollution repetitively for a large area.

77953609048	Influence of the impounding process of the Three Gorges Reservoir up to water level 172.5 m on water eutrophication in the Xiangxi Bay	The water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) rose to 172.5 m in two stages from September to November, 2008. The hydrodynamic parameters and water quality parameters (e.g. flow velocity, temperature, turbidity and nutrient content) had been continuously monitored to reveal the influence of the impounding process of the TGR on the water eutrophication in the Xiangxi Bay (XXB). The maximal daily rise of the water level of the TGR was about 2.38 m. The water exchange between the mainstream (the Changjiang River) and the XXB of the TGR was enhanced by density current, and its main characteristics were a density-stratified flow in different directions. The water exchange reduced the differences of the water quality parameters (for example, temperature, turbidity, nutrient level, pH, etc.) between the mainstream and the XXB during the impounding process. Meanwhile, the water stability index in the mainstream remained small but it was lowered in the XXB. The main causes included the dilution by water of lower concentration of the chlorophyll a (Chl. a) entering from the mainstream, the decline of the water stability, and the increase of suspended silt, which induced the Chl.a to decrease in the XXB during the impounding process. The grade of the water eutrophication changed from middle eutrophic level to mesotrophic state in the process. However, as available nutrients were imported into the XXB from the mainstream during the impounding process the risk of water eutrophication increases in the XXB in the future. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

Taking microseism and centigrade meters as the main experiment gauging methods, the mechanism of the landslide is studied and the feasibility of landslide is forecast by micro-seismic monitoring. The experimental results show that the strong rainfall before the initial reservoir impoundment period has little influence on the landslide stability; and the uplifting pressure due to the reservoir water will only induce the creeping of landslide, while the shear strength reduction of slippery zone by attenuation of water immersion is the true failure cause of the landslide. The microseismic events achieved from the experiment display the distortion-breakage-destruction process of landslide clearly, revealing the slippery zone destruction process that is from the toe to the middle of landslide; and the feasibility of landslide forecast by microseismic monitoring is verified.

Chlorophyll a, pH and water temperature could be the significant influence factors to dissolved oxygen in spring algal bloom by using stepwise multiple binomial regression and correlation analysis method. Mean value of dissolved oxygen in Xiangxi Bay during spring algal bloom was 8.555 ± 2.414 mg/L with a minimum and maximum concentration of 4.719 and 19.543 mg/L respectively and dissolved oxygen increased to the peak level as a result of algal bloom occurred in Xiangxi Bay and oxygen released during phytoplankton photosynthesis. Dissolved oxygen decreased from the surface to the bottom in the water column. The spatial change of dissolved oxygen in the bottom was not significant and difference of dissolved oxygen between the surface and the bottom in Xiangxi Bay was more significant than Yangtze River. © 2010 IEEE.

77956846431	Factors for stability of three-dimensional unsaturated soil landslides	Three-dimensional structure and unsaturated condition have essential influences on the evaluation of slope stability. In order to study the main influencing factors on the stability of unsaturated soil slopes, an extended three-dimensional model for standard tests is taken as the example, then based on elasto-plastic constitutive model and strength criterion of unsaturated soils, the numerical simulations of slope stability are carried out. From the two aspects of external and internal factors, the influencing rules on the stability of three-dimensional unsaturated soil slopes are analyzed by discussing the variation of negative pore water pressure distribution and underground water table caused by rainwater infiltration as well as the depth of sliding surface and the strength parameters. The results show that the three-dimensional method can reflect the spacial stress state and the shape of sliding surface, and that the influence degree of each analytical factors on the slope stability is successively the variation of ψ, the decline of suction due to water infiltration and the depth of sliding surface. With the depth increase, the effect of ψ increases, and the water infiltration has obvious influences on the shallow landslides.

79952617336	A three-dimensional procedure for evaluating the stability of gravity dams against deep slide in the foundation	In the design of a gravity dam, any dam monolith must be checked to determine if the stability against sliding along a potential failure surface in the foundation meets the requirement specified by the design code. Till date, such verification is usually carried out based on two-dimensional limit equilibrium methods. Two-dimensional analyses are sometimes too conservative to meet the requirements. For this purpose, in the context of the limit equilibrium methods, a rigorous three-dimensional procedure is developed, which can accommodate failure surfaces of any shape and satisfy all equilibrium conditions. Meanwhile, the procedure considers the reinforcement of concrete plugs that are laid between the sliding body and the rock foundation. On the base of distribution of factors of safety of all dam monoliths, an idea called "the design of equal safety" is suggested, which says that all monoliths should have nearly equal factors of safety as far as possible. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79953197494	A new integrated surface and subsurface flows model and its verification	A new coupled model for simulating surface and subsurface flows in a fully integrated way is presented. This model contains two sub-models; one is the 2D kinematic wave approximation of the Saint Venant's equations used to model runoff, and another is Richards' equation for variably saturated subsurface flow. In this model, boundary conditions (the conditions describing groundwater discharge at the land surface or surface water infiltration into the subsurface) could be eliminated through mathematic transformations of the governing equation of surface and subsurface flows. The solution of surface and subsurface flows could be simultaneous. And the surface domain and subsurface domain could be considered as a fully integrated domain. This approach naturally provides pressure and fluxes continuity along land surface. In order to assess this modelling approach, several classical validations, verification and application test cases are presented. For overland flow solely, the model is compared to an analytical solution and to commonly use hydrological models. The integrated model is then validated with a sandbox laboratory experiment and a soil column test. Finally, the effects of rainfall intensity, hydraulic conductivity of soils and initial bulk water content of soils to runoff and infiltration of a homogeneous soil slope are studied under different conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the coupling model of infiltration and runoff under rainfall, the drain model of surface drain ditch is realized by adjusting the slope gradients of the runoff control equation. The model is easy to understand and program composition. Furthermore, the seepage field, runoff field, the infiltration capacity and infiltration process are simulated for five typical landslides. The results show that when the rainfall intensity is smaller compared to infiltration rate of the soil, the surface drain should be set in front of the more penetrable slope segment to cut off the runoff in the upper and reduce the infiltration capacity; while the rainfall intensity is larger compared to infiltration rate of the soil, the effect of drain is not evident.

80051679810	Impacts of water release operations on algal blooms in a tributary bay of Three Gorges Reservoir	Water release operation is crucial for water quality in large reservoirs such as Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), because it determines the hydrodynamics and hence the self-purification capability. As algal blooms were often observed in some tributary bays of TGR during the release periods, high frequency field observations were carried out in a typical eutrophic tributary bay (Xiangxi River) from February 9 to May 10, 2009. In this paper we assess the hydrodynamic behaviour, density stratification, and trophic status in this bay, respectively using a series of observations for flow, physical, chemical and biological parameters. Then, we analyze the effects of reservoir release operations on algal blooms using correlation analysis method. An empirical prognosis is concluded for the likelihood of algal bloom occurrence as a function of daily fluctuation of water level (DFWL) and water temperature. Our results indicate that during the release period, the algal bloom occurrences are closely tied to the DFWL in that if the ratio of DFWL to total water depth ranges from -10×10

82955186390	Review on the methods to quantify fish's ability to cross velocity barriers in fish passage	Fish passage structures are constructed to facilitate fish moving to suitable habitats that are important during specific life stages. However, whether fish can successfully pass through a passage structure depends on their ability to swim against velocity barriers within the structure. Therefore, quantifying fish swimming ability is essential and to date, this knowledge is lacking for many species. Up to now, there is no widely-accepted method available to determine fish's ability crossing through velocity barriers. Establishment of such methods is important in both theoretical research and practical application. This review first summarized the widely-adopted methods for testing fish swimming ability. Swimming ability is mainly characterized by sustained swimming speed (i.e. the speed a fish can maintained for at least 200 minutes), critical swimming speed (i.e. the speed a fish can reach when using a step-wise protocol of speed increase) and burst speed (i. e. the maximum speed a fish can swim at, and this is usually maintained for <20 seconds). Critical swimming speed is the most common indicator of fish swimming ability. The critical swimming speed, burst speed and sustained speed are often used as references to design the fish passage, together with velocity field that is calculated by mathematical model. However, there are strong arguments that it is not effective to design fish passages according to the above swimming speeds because they are mainly determined in uniform flow condition which is significantly different from the complicated water flows in real passage structures. Unsteady flow (e. g. turbulence), which is a common phenomenon caused by the frictional effects of substrate and other objects in the water that disrupt laminar flow, might bring differences from laboratory results to field application. Thus, this review analyzed the key factors which affect fish crossing past velocity barriers, including fish behavior, metabolism, and hydraulics. Fish behavior has important influence on the ability to cross flow barriers, and such behaviors include sprinting, burst-glide, substratum skimming, jumping and flow refuging. Accordingly, researchers have defined the sprinting speed, gait transition speed, burst-glide speed and leaping ability of fishes to quantify their ability cross velocity barriers. Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism provides energy for fish swimming, and the related parameters such as oxygen consumption rate, blood glucose and lactate are effective indicators of a fish's ability to cross passage structures. In recent research, excessive post-exercise oxygen consumption and transport costs are used to measure energy expenditure during and after swimming in order to understand energy utilization and recovery. Hydraulics is another factor affecting fishes' ability to cross velocity barriers. It is observed that turbulence and jet-flows affect fish behavior and metabolism, thus affect passage success. Appropriate flow fields can increase the potential for fish to cross vertical slot fishways and culverts. In summary, a fish's ability to pass through velocity barriers is complicated and depends on several biotic and abiotic factors. Future studies are suggested to (1) analyze the relationships between swimming behavior, swimming ability and hydraulic condition, and (2) quantify the energy cost-recovery rate during fish crossing velocity barriers, and (3) develop mathematical models to describe the probability that a fish can pass through velocity barriers according to the above relationships between hydraulic condition, swimming behavior and energy dynamics.

84859398667	Study of inclined loading mode on slope in physical model test	Usually a physical model can be built to simulate the failure process of slope and study the instability mechanism of slope, while inclined model is a typical loading method to simulate the failure process. As a loading method, the controllability of loading mode and similarity of stress field during inclining process are significant points that can influence the application of the method. In order to study the controllability of test, taking bulk slip mass for example, the influences of inclined model and centrifugal loading methods on anti-sliding safety factor of slip mass are analyzed. The results show that anti-sliding safety factor decreases persistently with the inclination angle increasing in the inclined loading mode. But the anti-sliding safety factors of centrifugal loading test are influenced obviously when the acceleration is in the range of 1g-10g(where g is acceleration of gravity). In order to compare the similarities of stress field in the model before and after inclining, a numerical model of physical slope is built to simulate stress fields with different inclination angles. The results show that the stress state in the middle of slope keep steady; the stress state in the front part of slope changes greatly when the inclination angle is larger; variation of local stress field is propitious to simulate the failure process of reservoir landslide. In order to verify the application effect of the inclined model to landslide failure process, a slope model test is taken based on the prototype of Qianjiangping landslide; the failure process of landslide is obtained. Comparing with the results simulated by discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) method, the failure form obtained from inclined model test is closer to the real condition of landslide.

84862798072	Effects of vertical mixing on phytoplankton blooms in Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir: Implications for management	Since the initial filling of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), serious phytoplankton blooms have occurred in its tributary bays. Cyanobacteria blooms have been observed in a number of tributary bays and threaten the drinking water security of residents in the TGR region. To identify the key factors controlling phytoplankton blooms in tributary bays and propose an effective management strategy, a one-year water quality study (November 2009 to October 2010) was conducted in Xiangxi Bay (XXB) of TGR. The results show that a rapid decrease in mixing depth is associated with the spring bloom, fading of the fall bloom occurs with the rapid increase in mixing depth, and an extremely shallow mixing depth is associated with cyanobacteria blooms that predominate during the summer. Development of thermal stratification in XXB is the major cause of seasonal variation in mixing depth and density current intrusion from TGR is the major cause of short-term variation in mixing depth. The seasonal thermal stratification of XXB is disrupted by sufficiently large water level fluctuations in TGR. The density current is lifted from mid-depths to the surface and chlorophyll a concentrations rapidly decrease in response. Based on these findings, a conceptual model is proposed for a management strategy to control phytoplankton blooms in tributary bays via controlled releases from TGR. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862304346	Research on mechanical properties of corroded steel bar in concrete under chloride environment	Based on the experiments, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the rule for the residual properties of corroded reinforcing bars in chloride environment is discussed, and the cause is analyzed. 214 corroded bars were taken from the RC specimens experienced wet-dry cycle test for two years. The tensile experiment results show that when the corrosion ratio is small, the nominal strength of the steel bar decrease almost linearly with the reduction of corrosion ratio; when the corrosion ratio is large, the nominal strength and the equivalent strength decrease with the increase of corrosion ratio, so it is ductility. As to the force-displacement curve, the yield is lowered, even disappears as the corrosion is more and more non-uniform. The fracture morphology changes with local corrosion characters is tics, which can be described as 3 types. Under the same condition, the mechanical properties of corroded small-diameter bars are degraded more than that of large ones. From the analysis of theory and simulation based on experiment, it may conclude that the actual tensile strength of reinforcing bars changes not remarkably pre and post the corrosion. The nominal tensile strength is decreased, chiefly because of the cross sectional area decreased after corrosion that lead to the decrease of resistance. The decrease of cross sectional area, notch effect and the additional eccentric force due to corrosion have a remarkable influence on the elongation of steel bars. It is mainly attributed to the additional moment for the local non-uniform corrosion that the yield platform on the force-displacement curve is shortened, even disappears.

The sensitivity analysis to model parameters shows that crack width on the surface is the most important factor for the corrosion depth of steel; stirrup spacing also has a significant effect on the corrosion depth of longitudinal reinforcement; the smaller the stirrup spacing is, the more remarkable the effect is. The experimental data show that the model is of good applicability.

In these two periods, transparency, near surface current velocity, water temperature differences between surface and bottom, mixing depth, rate of nitrogen vs. phosphorus, turbidity, total nitrogen, relative water column stability and rate of euphotic depth and mixing depth were significantly different. During the discharging stage, the discharging process did not limit algal growth. However, during the impounding stage, strengthening density current intrusion intensified vertical mixing and increased the mixing depth in the bay. Thus, smaller ratio of euphotic vs. mixing depth played a key inhibition role on algae propagation.

Meanwhile, the phosphoric loadings from point and non-point sources were identified, respectively. The results show that: the variation of rainfall-runoff under 'squat' rain was relatively slow, while under 'pointed thin' rain it presented quickly both during rising and recession. Total phosphorus concentration increased quickly because soil carried particulate phosphorus into water under the heavy rainfall, while the relative variations of dissolved total phosphorus and orthophosphate concentration were slightly elevated. Compared with 'squat' rain, the maximum value of total phosphorus concentration and flux were both higher in 'pointed thin' rain, which led to the more heavily soil erosion. The dynamics of flux and concentration of phosphorus were generally consistent with that of the flow rate between the two different types of rain. Phosphorus from non-point source accounts for 90% during the whole heavy rain. Because of the long lasted time during 'squat' rain, the contribution of the 'squat' rain outweighs the 'pointed thin' rain.

84874870778	The Influence of hydrodynamic conditions on algal bloom in the Three Gorges Reservoir tributaries	Water level has risen considerably since the impounding of Three-Gorges Reservoir in year 2003 and that might broaden and deepen the Yangtze River and the tributary of Three Gorge, will greatly slowdown the flow velocity to change hydrodynamic conditions. This changes Influence the Water Environment of Yangtze River and the tributary of Three Gorges Reservoir, especially eutrophication and algal bloom of the tributaries in Three Gorges Reservoir in recent years. For studying the course of algal bloom in the tributaries of Three Gorges Reservoir and the comprehensive prevention countermeasures, about the hydrodynamics of Yangtze River main stream and tributary in Three Gorges Reservoir must be carefully researched. In this article, general situation of the algal bloom of the tributaries in Three Gorges Reservoir were presented, and analysed on characteristics and influencing factors of breakout of algal bloom from certain self-conditions changes before and after impoundment of the Three Gorges reservoir, knowing that lower the nutrient input and improve water flow regime and flow velocity behaviors are the main measures of comprehensive prevention countermeasures of algal bloom in the tributaries of Three Gorges Reservoir; This research status of influence mechanism of hydrodynamic conditions on algal bloom and the research tendency of the tributaries' hydrodynamic conditions on algal bloom in Three Gorges Reservoir were reviewed, which provided certain theory reference for study and prevention countermeasures of algal bloom in the Three Gorges Reservoir tributaries. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84874879683	Field monitoring and numerical simulating on three-dimensional thermal density currents in the estuary of Xiangxi River	To study the special hydrodynamic characteristic in the estuary of Xiangxi River, this project monitored water temperature and flow velocity both of Yangtze River and Xiangxi River in 2010. In addition to monitoring the water environment of two rivers, a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic model was also applied. By utilizing both field data and a numerical model, a more holistic view of the 3-D thermal density currents was discovered than by using either method alone. The results of the study showed that the invasion form of water from Yangtze River changed along with the variation of differences in water temperature between two rivers. The invasion water influenced the flow field and thermal field distributions in the estuary of XXR: The farther away from the river mouth, the thermal stratification was stronger and the water temperature horizontal distribution was more uniform. Flow velocity decreased as the distance from the river mouth increased. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The life skill trainings for the hatchery fish before its release may have active effects on the improvement of the survival rate of post-release. This paper analyzed the reasons for the low survival rate of fish post-release, and pointed out that foraging and anti-predation capability was one of the key factors affecting the survival rate of fish post-release. The key factors affecting the foraging and anti-predation capability, including prey and predator recognition, social learning experience, environmental complexity, and fish swimming ability were discussed, and the innovative training techniques leading to a higher fish post-release survival rate were suggested.

84879786953	An eco-environmental friendly operation: An effective method to mitigate the harmful blooms in the tributary bays of Three Gorges Reservoir	Harmful algal blooms, which frequently occur in different tributaries, have become a serious water quality problem of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) since its initial filling. A three-year monitoring campaign from 2008 to 2010 was conducted to identify the controlling factors of algal blooms and effective preventive measures. The following results were obtained: 1) Layered and bidirectional currents, called intrusive density currents, dominate the tributary bays of the TGR year round; 2) continuously increasing water level can make the intruding density current shift from the middle to the surface, and surface intrusive water can reduce the surface water temperature and break the stable stratification of the tributary; 3) the appearing or fading away of algal blooms is closely associated with fluctuations in the TGR water level. Thus, the water level fluctuation patterns of different "tide-types" may prevent the occurrence of algal blooms in the spring and summer, and the "stair-type" tides may control autumn blooms during the impounding period. These methods were feasible and effective throughout the actual TGR's operation in 2009-2011. These patterns formed an eco-environmentally friendly operation (EEFO) to mitigate algal blooms. As an in situ treatment with easier operation and less negative impact and loss, compared with chemical and filter-feeding fish methods, the EEFO is currently considered as the most feasible remedial measure to remit the eco-environmental problems at the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84879149087	Characteristics of nutrient loss by runoff in sloping arable land of yellow-brown under different rainfall intensities	In order to investigate the loss characteristics of N and P through surface flow and interflow under different rainfall intensities, a field experiment was conducted on the sloping arable land covered by typical yellow-brown soils inXiangxi River watershed by artificial rainfall. The results showed that the discharge of surface flow, total runoff and sediment increased with the increase of rain intensity, while the interflow was negatively correlated with rain intensity under the same total rainfall. TN, DN and DP were all flushed at the very beginning in surface flow underdifferent rainfall intensities; TP fluctuated and kept consistent in surface flow without obvious downtrend. While TN, DN and DP in interflow kept relatively stable in the whole runoff process, TP was high at the early stage, then rapidly decreased with time and kept steady finally. P was directly influenced by rainfall intensity, its concentration in the runoff increased with the increase of the rainfall intensity, the average concentration of N and P both exceeded the threshold of eutrophication of freshwater. The higher the amount of P loss was, the higher the rain intensity. The change of N loss was the opposite. The contribution rate of TN loss carried by surface flow increased from 36.5% to 57.6% with the increase of rainfall intensity, but surface flow was the primary form of P loss which contributed above 90.0%. Thus, it is crucial to control interflow in order to reduce N loss. In addition, measures should be taken to effectively manage soil erosion to mitigate P loss. The proportion of dissolved nitrogen in surface flow elevated with the decrease of rainfall intensity, but in interflow, dissolved form was predominant. P was exported mainly in the form of particulate under different rainfall intensities and runoff conditions.

84883292708	Temporal variation of methane flux from Xiangxi Bay of the Three Gorges Reservoir	Three diel field campaigns and one monthly sampling campaign during June 2010-May 2011 were carried out to investigate the CH 4 flux across the water-gas interface in Xiangxi Bay of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The average CH 4 flux was much less than that reported from reservoirs in tropic and temperate regions. The photosynthesis of phytoplankton dominated the diel gas fluxes during alga bloom in spring and summer. The maximum monthly flux occurred in June 2010 and corresponded to the lowest water level. Water temperature, sediment temperature, and TOC did not have significant correlation with the monthly CH 4 fluxes. Continuously decreasing hydrostatic pressure and the low water level resulted in more CH 4 emission at the sediment-water during the discharging period, and thus increases the CH 4 effluxes because the diffusion time through a thin water column is shorter and less CH 4 may be oxidized compared with that in a long water column.

84894559614	Prediction of chlorophyll a concentration using HJ-1 satellite imagery for Xiangxi Bay in Three Gorges Reservoir	Since the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir in 2003, algal blooms have frequently been observed in it. The chlorophyll a concentration is an important parameter for evaluating algal blooms. In this study, the chlorophyll a concentration in Xiangxi Bay, in the Three Gorges Reservoir, was predicted using HJ-1 satellite imagery. Several models were established based on a correlation analysis between in situ measurements of the chlorophyll a concentration and the values obtained from satellite images of the study area from January 2010 to December 2011. Chlorophyll a concentrations in Xiangxi Bay were predicted based on the established models. The results show that the maximum correlation is between the reflectance of the band combination of B4/(B2+B3) and in situ measurements of chlorophyll a concentration. The root mean square errors of the predicted values using the linear and quadratic models are 18.49 mg/m

In surveys, the sampling was undertaken from six sites of Xiangxi Bay on three dates: 29 March 2009, 28 March 2010 and 17 August 2010. Mean values of total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen contents in the sediments and pore water of Xiangxi Bay all increased with time, especially in summer. There were intimate relationships between internal nitrogen loading and water ecosystem. Correlation coefficients R were 0.7408 (between total nitrogen in pore water and total nitrogen in sediments) and 0.7483 (between total nitrogen in sediments and chlorophyll-a in surface water), respectively. Total nitrogen concentration differences between pore water and overlying water were all positive and had good correlation with chlorophyll-a concentration of Xiangxi Bay. The release of nitrogen in sediments had an important impact on phytoplankton growth in Xiangxi Bay. © 2012 CIWEM.

84896049495	A laboratorial method for establishing the velocity curve of fish habitat suitability	Biological habitat method is one of the main methods for calculating ecological water demand in river. To establish the numerical relationship between organisms and characteristic index, which represents the physical and chemical property of habitat, is the key part in biological habitat method. Flow velocity is one of the most important indicators of habitat, and the velocity curve of habitat suitability usually stands for the relationship between organisms and flow velocity. Traditional habitat suitability curve for fish can be obtained through experience or spot field investigation, whose drawbacks include subjectivity, huge cost and time-consuming. In order to make up above drawbacks, the authors attempt to design a circular channel with gradually varied velocity. Taking a physiological and ecological control test of young Carassius Auratus as an example, a new method has been put forward to obtain the velocity curve of fish habitat suitability, which indirectly comes from the aggregative indicator of physiological and ecological indexes. The result shows that the curve can quite accurately reflect the function between fish and flow velocity. Our experiment and analytical method can be used as a source of reference to create velocity curve of habitat suitability for various organisms.

84901660344	Study of mechanical behaviors of key blocks and characteristics of force transmit and stability coefficient of different stress states of landslides	The mechanical behaviors of key blocks and characteristics of force transfer of landslides were analyzed. The interactions among forces of sliding, friction and thrust were investigated assuming the anti-sliding forces were not reduced. The slice is at the critical stress state if the sliding force is equal to the friction. Representative characteristics of thrust between the analyzed slices were studied. The difference of the thrust between slices defines the different stress states. If the stresses of slices are between the residual stress state and the peak stress state, the trust change decrease or increase gradually(the measured values of the thrusts can be negative or positive). If the stresses of slices have not reached the peak state, the thrust increases gradually(the measured values of the thrusts can only be positive). A relationship between the coefficients of stability considering the different stress states was derived. The coefficient of stability calculated with the conventional stability analyses in terms of the critical stress state of landslides was not the smallest one, while that calculated in terms of the residual stress state turned out to be the smallest one, considering three different stress state(the critical stress state, the failure stress state, the residual stress state and the mixed stress state).

The riverbed samples were classified into silt, pebble and gravel. The submerged macrophyte types were categorized into: No plant, Vallisneria spiralis, Hydrilla verticillata, and Vallisneria spiralis+Hydrilla verticillata. The macrofauna belonged to 6 classes, 34 genera and 42 species. Species similarity, density, biomass, functional feeding group and diversity were used as indices for comparison of macrofauna community differences between the eight places. Analysis was performed using CLUSTER, NMDS and one-way ANOVA methods. Results show that macrofauna taxon composition, density, functional feeding group, and species diversity had significant variations in different bed, with those in silt being especially different than in pebble and gravel. In silt, macrofauna taxon composition, biomass, relative abundance of filter-collectors were higher where submerged macrophyte were present, but the total density was lower. In pebble, the total biomass and functional feeding group had obvious difference between Hydrilla verticillata and Hydrilla verticillata. In gravel, all the indices had little difference between Vallisneria spiralis and Vallisneria spiralis + Hydrilla verticillata. The analysis of the RDA (Redundancy analysis) can well explain the differences among the eight places, namely demonstrating that the influence of bed types on the distribution of macrofauna was larger than submerged macrophyte, and that the two factors had strong interactions.

84920685194	Study of mechanical properties of landslides in different stress state	The mechanical behaviours of key blocks are analysed for landslides. In general, the deformation of key block is small, and if this occurs, the failure of landslide will happen; or the antisliding force will augment, when the deformation of key block increases, if the key block fails, the landslide failure will occur. The characteristics of force transmit are analysed; the relationships among sliding force, frictional resistance and trust are investigated under the condition that the antisliding forces are not taken the reduction; the critical stress slice is defined to be a state wherein the vector sum of sliding force and frictional resistance is equal to zero, that is the trust is equal to zero. Representative characteristics of thrust between slice blocks are researched, the trust's change between slices will be larger or smaller, when the slice blocks are located at the destroyed zone or the residual stress state (the trust measuring value may be negative or positive); when the stresses of slices take the sate before peak, the thrust's change will be more and more (the measuring value of trust becomes positive). These relative researches are a guiding role for the in situ monitoring of landslides. The stable factor obtained by conventional method of landslides is studied by considering the four different stress states (the critical stress state, the destroyed stress state, the residual stress state and their comprehensive stress state); the stable coefficient obtained by conventional critical stress state method is not minimum, and it is obtained when conventional residual stress state is minimum, and their relationships are deduced.

The induction velocity of the juvenile grass carp, silver carp, and darkbarbel catfish was (8.21±0.68), (6.74±0.84), and (33.11±3.06) cm·s<sup>-1</sup>, and the relative induction velocity was (0.91±0.22), (0.67±0.15), and (2.9±0.29) BL·s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the induction velocity between juvenile grass carp and silver carp (P>0.05), but the induction velocity of juvenile darkbarbel catfish was four times higher than that of the juvenile grass carp and silver carp. It was suggested that the juvenile grass carp and silver carp were more sensitive to the water velocity than the juvenile darkbarbel catfish. This study could provide scientific reference for designing the fish way and determining the trawling speed.

Samples were taken from 33 different sites from July 30 to August 19, 2011. The nutrient patterns of the three representative tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR)—the Modao, the Daning, and the Xiangxi Rivers—were also investigated. The results show that the mainstream of the TGR has a higher concentration of nitrogen and a lower concentration of phosphorus than that of the upper mainstream before the TGR. Moreover, it was found that nitrate-nitrogen (NO<inf>3</inf>-N) is the main nitrogen component, while particulate phosphorus predominates the total phosphorus (TP). It was found that the three representative tributaries of the TGR have lower total nitrogen (TN) concentrations compared to the corresponding sections of the mainstream TGR. Based on the nutrient spatial pattern, the nutrient flux was calculated. The total fluxes of TN, NO<inf>3</inf>-N, TP, and orthophosphate (PO<inf>4</inf>-P) from the upstream reach into the TGR are 2,155.06, 1,674.97, 212.98, and 83.42 t day<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The amount of nutrients imported from the TGR into its tributaries is more than the amount exported. It was determined that the Xiangxi River has the largest net rate of imported nitrogen at 7.66 t day<sup>−1</sup>, whereas the Daning River has the largest net rate of imported phosphorus at 1.75 t day<sup>−1</sup>. In addition, compared with the nutrients imported from the TGR into its tributaries, the nutrient flux from the upstream reach into the TGR contributes approximately less than 3 %.

Results show that biomass and Chl-a concentration of the phytoplankton in the main stream of the Yangtze River was much lower than that respectively in XXB during the algae bloom season in summer, which was mainly attributed to the fact that the water body of the main stream of the Yangtze River was well mixed, while that of XXB was weakly mixed vertically. As a result the phytoplankton in the latter grew flourishingly and evolved from diatom (in June) to green algae (in July) and then to cyanobacteria (in August). Gray correlation analysis indicates that density of the phytoplankton was closely related to thickness of the euphotic layer and the mixed layer of the waterbody with correlation coefficient being over 0. 6 and that succession of the phytoplankton communities was mainly affected by water temperature, waterbody stability and thickness of the mixed layer.
