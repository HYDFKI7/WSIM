13944254376	Improved cut-off negative pressure method for unsteady seepage flow with free surface	The cut-off negative pressure method is one of effective approaches to solve the seepage flow problem with free surface. According to the characteristics of cut-off negative pressure method, however, it is found out that the deficiency of the algorithm is to easily cause inexact simulation in the vicinity area around free surface owing to the penalty function with only one controlling penalty parameter. Therefore, the improved cut-off pressure method is presented by constructing penalty function with two controlling penalty parameters. The improved algorithm is able to improve the simulation precision and convergence speed through considering the effect of the partially saturated or unsaturated elements more precisely and calculating the node forces more accurately. Finally, the improved cut-off negative pressure method is applied to simulation of unsteady seepage flow with free surface, and the corresponding program codes are developed with validation of some examples.

15944389568	Multiple-index assessment for global stability of high-steep rock slope of the three gorges project permanent shiplock	It is a controversial problem to assess comprehensively the global stability of high-steep rock slope of the Three Gorges Project permanent shiplock. The information on slope stability includes geological data, results of numerical analysis, measuremental data, experiential knowledge, and so on. Therefore, a suitable analytical methodology of system engineering integrating the comprehensive qualitative and quantitative information is needed. A multi-index system and model, which is able to evaluate comprehensively the global stability of high-steep rock slope by using extension theory, is proposed. The qualitative grade and quantitative degree for the global stability of high-steep rock slope by the index system and model can be obtained. The slope stability can be assessed dynamically. Analytic Hierarchy Process method has been used to compute the subjective weights of evaluation indexes. The objective weights can be obtained by calculating the relational degree between evaluation indexes and grades with extension theory. By combination of the views of both the subjective and objective weights, an optimization theory has been used to calculate the weights for index evaluation. The results have shown that for the high-steep rock slope of the Three Gorges Project permanent shiplock, its grade and degree of global stability are 1 and 1.86, respectively. Then the global stability can be ranged between excellent and good. The numerical example has shown that the proposed method is feasible and effective, and the evaluation results are reasonable. In addition, this method can also be used to assess dam health, rock quality, and dam aging.

The relation between load set and effect set is main factor determining character of dam structure. In fact, the diagnosis of dam safety is a process of finding the factors causing problems in dam behaviour and dam safety. The information of dam safety, viz. data, rules, knowledge, need be analyzed through the integration of qualitative methods and quantitative methods. From the viewpoint of systems engineering, a diagnosis model was proposed to analyze dam behaviour. Rough sets theory was used to discover adaptively the influence factors of dam safety. A decision system was built to describe the qualitative or quantitative information on dam safety. It was composed of problems in dam behaviour and influence factors determined by experiential knowledge and other projects. Rough sets theory was used to eliminate the redundant factors.

25144469400	Time series evolution forecasting model of slope deformation based on multiple factors	A lot of factors such as topography, geological conditions and rainfall influence slope deformation. The importance of rainfall is difficult to determine. Based on the analysis of the multiple factors of slope deformation and observation of monitoring deformations, a statistic method to correlate slope deformation and rainfall was developed including the hysteresis of rainfall. Whereafter, by applying observation to ordinary statistic model comprising rainfall, temperature and time factor, the main factors affecting slope deformation were extracted by stepwise regression. According to the factors extracted and time series observation, a recursion model was obtained with multilayer recursion analysis method of dynamic system forecasting. At the end, a time series evolution forecasting model of slope deformation was presented combining with regression model and recursion model. The model syncretizes the merits of regression analysis and recursive analysis for enhancing the capability of forecasting evolution of slope deformation. Through comparison between the forecasting and the observation of monitoring deformations, the deformation and stability of slope can be monitored. The engineering case analysis indicates that the model is effective and has big value for forecasting of slope deformation.

25144502947	Time series evolution model for deformation modulus of geological defect	Geological defects existing extensively in foundations often do harms to the safety of buildings. At the same time, construction of large-scale structures leads to variation of the natural geological condition. And in some cases, the geological defects may deteriorate with the construction of structures, which will bring adverse impacts on the normal operation of the buildings. Deformation modulus of the geological defect is a key parameter that reflects its deformation and strength character, so deformation modulus of the geological defect is used to study its evolvement rules. The theory, which is to build time series evolution model for geological defect by use of monitoring data, is presented. Then based on Elman recurrent neural networks, the detailed process to build time series evolution model for geological defect is proposed.

The PLSR method is well integrated with non-model-style data connotation analyses, thus the regression modeling, data structure simplifing and the multicollinearity analyzing could be simultaneously carried out, and the model precision is controlled by the method of cross validation test. Model results show that the PLSR method has a wider applicability than the least-square regression method, for the former can satisfactorily identify system information or noise and effectively eliminate the multicollinearity effects on model accuracy of simulation and forecast, which makes the model tend to be more reasonable in physical genesis analyses on observation data.

Aimed at this shortage, an uncertainty inverse analysis method for engineering system was studied. From uncertainty analysis point of view, the engineering structure was considered as an uncertainty system, and a Bayesian uncertainty inverse analysis method based on the principle of maximum entropy (POME) was put forward, which organically combined information entropy theory and Bayesian method of inverse analysis, so that the system discriminance problem of uncertainty inverse analysis was transformed into an optimization evaluation problem for Bayesian rule function. Utilizing appropriate optimization method, uncertainty inverse analysis could be realized for evaluations of engineering structure parameters or fountainhead loads. As an engineering example, the method advanced was utilized to carry out inverse analyses of material parameters of dam concrete elastic modulus and bedrock deformation modulus. The calculation results show that the material parameters obtained are right and that the precision is higher than that of the conventional deterministic methods of inverse analysis which is widely used presently.

By setting up lamellar elements in general 3D FEM to simulate the dam concrete cracks and the bed rock conformations such as fault, weak interlayer and cracked belt, the inverse analysis method proposed can effectively simulate the interfacial characteristics of opening, cutting and sliding.

The autoclave expansion value and strength of that concrete were investigated and the relationships between the expansion or strength and the soundness were discussed. The results of this study showed that it was unsuitable to apply a standard for the soundness evaluation of cement with MgO to that of concrete. Unlike the MgO content upper limit 5% in cement, more than 5% in concrete is acceptable. The soundness of concrete can be evaluated on the basis of expansion rate or strength changes after autoclave and it will be better to use changes in strength to express the volume soundness of concrete. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Dam behavior is influenced by geological factors and engineering factors. Some of above factors are determinate, others are stochastic, fuzzy and alterable. It is a decision-making problem of engineering system to assess dam behavior. Qualitative knowledge and quantitative data need to be integrated.

The identification model needs to be described with a complicated and nonlinear function. Wavelet networks based on wavelet frames were used to establish the identification models of dam behavior for the first time. Firstly, time-frequency analysis for training data was implemented to determine the original structure of the wavelet network. Next, a new method was proposed for iterative elimination of the redundant neurons according to the dependency between the network output and the nodes in the hidden layer. In this method, rough sets theory was used to calculate the dependency. Lastly, this article built the identification models for the displacement and cracks of one concrete arch-dam with the trained wavelet network.

The results showed that there were relations between the morphologies of brucite and its forming conditions. The size of brucite crystals increased with the curing time, and they were fiber-shaped at lower curing temperature and stick-shaped at higher temperature. When MgO was cured in paste with 10 percent cement, the crystal of brucite was fiber-shaped, while cured in paste with 95 percent cement, the crystal was hexaflaggyshaped, which aggregated and produced some micro-cracks in paste when the curing temperature was increased. At 180°C autoclaving temperature of MgO, the brucite was regular hexaflaggy-shaped crystal; for 216°C, it was less irregular. When the paste mixed with 50 percent fly ash, the crystal of brucite was needle-shaped and distributed more evenly, so decreased the deformation and crack of the concrete.

34548316481	Optimization inversion of concrete dam's time-dependent parameters based on deformation monitoring data	Based on the deformation monitoring data, three-step method which is used for inverse analysis of time-dependent parameters of dam and rock foundation is developed. Firstly, the elastic moduli of dam and rock foundation are inversely analyzed according to the water pressure components apart from monitoring model. Then, the elastic module of the viscous element is inversely analyzed using the steady value of time-dependent parameter components. Finally, the viscous parameters of the viscous element are inversely analyzed based on the process value of the time-dependent components. Taking the Longyangxia gravity arch dam as an example, the method is used for inversion of time-dependent parameters which are sensitive. The reasons that the radial time-dependent deformation of the crown beam between the elevation 2530 and 2610 m is towards upstream are explained in mechanical mechanism. Because the viscous coefficients of the dam and foundation rock are great, the time-dependent deformation caused by the dam self-weight leads to the dam upstream deformation stabilize in a long time; and the long-term low water level of the Longyangxia gravity arch dam is also a factor.

Two different earthquake input mechanisms are used for comparison, including massless foundation input model and viscous-spring boundary model considering radiation damping due to infinite canyon.

Compared with the results of using massless foundation input model, the damage-cracking region and contraction joint opening are substantially reduced when using viscous-spring boundary model to take into account radiation damping. However, if the damping ratio of the dam is artificially increased to about 10%-15% for massless foundation input model, the joint opening and damage-cracking of the dam are comparable to the results obtained from the viscous-spring boundary model. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

The dam deformation is the result of the mutual game playing between source factors and resistance factors. Therefore, resistance factors of structure and materials that reflect resistance character of arch dam structure are introduced into the traditional model, where structure factor is embodied by the flexibility coefficient of dam body and the maximum dam height, and material property is embodied by the elastic modulus of dam.

62549098613	Influence of fractality of fracture surfaces on stress and displacement fields at crack tips	In the classic theory of fracture mechanics, expressions for calculating the stresses and displacements in the vicinity of the crack tip are deduced on the basis of the assumption that a fracture surface is a smooth surface or that a crack is a smooth crack. In fact, the surface of a crack formed during the fracture is usually very irregular. So the real asymptotic form of the stress and displacement fields at the crack tip is different from the classic one. Considering the irregularity of a real fracture surface or a real crack profile, the crack is taken as a fractal one, and then the real asymptotic form at the crack tip is developed by applying Griffith's energy balance principle and fractal geometry. Through the developed asymptotic form, it is discovered that the fractality of the crack reduces the stress singularity at the crack tip. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

67649834030	Evaluation model for service life of dam based on time-varying risk probability	For many dam projects in China, the 50-year designed life time is coming to an end. It is urgent to study the theory and method to evaluate the dam service life. In this paper, firstly, the probability theory of fuzzy event and time-varying effect theory are used to analyze the time-variety of various risk factors in the process of dam operations. A method is proposed to quantify the above time-variety and a model to describe the fuzzy time-varying risk probability for the dam structure is also built. Secondly, the information entropy theory is used to analyze the uncertain degree relationship between the characteristic value of membership function and fuzzy risk probability, and a mathematical method is presented to calculate the time-varying risk probability accordingly. Thirdly, the relation mode between time-varying risk probability and service life is discussed. Based on this relation mode and the acceptable risk probability of dams in China, a method is put forward to evaluate and forecast the dam service life. Finally, the proposed theory and method are used to analyze one concrete dam. The dynamic variability and mutation feature of the dam risk probability are analyzed. The remaining service life of this dam is forecasted. The obtained results can provide technology support for the project management department to make treatment measures of engineering and reasonably arrange reinforce cost. The principles in this paper have wide applicability and can be used in risk analysis for slope instability and other fields. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

70349378893	A Model for dam health monitoring	Quantitative analysis of monitoring data obtained from concrete dams can provide useful information about the behavior of dams, permit prediction of the future values by considering the corresponding actions, and detect abnormalities (or irregularities) as early as possible to enable a timely response. It can also contribute to options regarding the building process and to control of the construction program during construction. As a rule, the traditional statistic models can be used in quantitative analysis of monitoring data. A statistic model is established on the basis of all monitoring data. After a long time (maybe several years), the coefficients in the model are updated. Before updating, the old coefficients are always used without considering the new measurements added. As a result, the reliability and accuracy of the prediction with the models are doubtful. Therefore, the models are essentially static. To monitor the dam in real time, it is necessary to update the models dynamically. To overcome the drawback of the traditional statistic model, a dynamic model for dam monitoring, based on a recursive method, is set up. An example is provided, and it shows that the quality of prediction of the dynamic model presented is better than that of the static model. If the dynamic model is used along with automatic monitoring system, it can monitor a dam in real time and predict the behavior of the dam more accurately.

70349389839	Time varying analysis is model for cracks causality of concrete dams	The main factors of influencing the crack change of concrete dams can be reduced to three parts of water pressure, temperature and aging, but it is very difficult to get the effects of this three parts respectively. The nonlinear time-varying relationship between the crack change and its influencing factors is very strong. Using the unique ability of data analysis and learning of artificial neural network, and through the intercrossing of dam construction knowledge, then a good approach to solve these problems can be offered. In this paper, based on in-situ monitoring data of concrete dams, from the angle of machine learning, the time varying analysis model for causality of cracks of concrete dams is introduced, and the evolution law of load cracks with the change of time and load is analyzed and forecasted. The example indicates that the model can finely describe and forecast the time varying characteristic of cracks causality in concrete dams, and can give each factor's contribution to crack opening.

70349408991	A model for quantitative analysis of stresses of the three gorges dam in construction	In the field of dam safety monitoring, quantitative analysis of monitoring results is a very important task. It can offer useful information about the behavior of dams, permit prediction of the future values by consideration of the corresponding actions, and detect anomalies as early as possible to enable a timely response. To date almost all work has been focusing on quantitative analysis of monitoring results obtained from dams in service, but quantitative analysis of monitoring results obtained from dams during construction has been neglected. In fact, the quantitative analysis of monitoring results obtained during construction is very important because it can contribute to options regarding the building process and to control of the construction program during construction. For the purpose of quantitative analysis of monitoring results obtained during construction, it is necessary to establish a mathematical model. However, such a model does not exist yet. This paper presents a model and derives the formula in the mathematical model for the quantitative analysis of monitoring data obtained during the construction. As an example of the application of the model, the monitoring results obtained from the Three Gorges dam, which is the largest and the most important dam under construction in China, are used. The example shows that the model is well established and can be applied to analyze quantitatively the monitoring results obtained during construction.

Based on a comparison of stress and displacement components of the semi-infinite elastic foundation, the elastic finite depth foundation with rigid constraint at the bottom, and the elastic finite depth foundation with smooth rigid supporting constraint at the bottom under infinite uniform pressure on horizontal surface, it is concluded that the elastic finite deep foundation model with rigid constraint at the bottom is more rational than other two models.

For steady observation series, a control field for the whole observation values has been established based upon PCA; for unsteady observation series that have significant tendency, a control field for the future observation values has been constructed according to PC statistical predication model. These methods have already been applied to an actual project and the results showed that data interpretation method with PCA can not only realize data reduction, lower data redundancy, and reduce noise and false alarm rate, but also be effective to data analysis, having a broad application prospect. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

84863154889	The mechanical behavior and model of the crossfeed of the contact bodies	Interactions occur between the contact bodies under the outside loads. The crossfeed is the dynamic changing process of the contact surface, named crossfeed surface, under the loads, which is an important task in civil engineering. Aiming at the shortcoming of the classical contact mechanics, in which the contact surface is considered smooth, with the help of the shearing and ploughing of the tribology, the mechanical behavior and correspond model of the interacted contact bodies were studied. Based on the fracture mechanics, the cohesion of the crossfeed surface varied with the contact areas was acquired, and the algorithm of the corssfeed mechanical model of the contact bodies was studied. Compared with the photo-elastic experiment of the joint sample, the result shows that the corssfeed mechanical model of the contact bodies is more practical than the traditional model. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84864566844	Safety evaluation of replacement reinforcement quality in abutment contact zones of ultra-high arch dam in first impoundment period based on prototype monitoring	Reinforcement quality evaluation at the abutment is an important research direction. Prototype monitoring and theoretical derivation were integrated to study the replacement reinforcement quality in abutment contact zones of the Xiaowan ultra-high arch dam. The principles of monitoring layout and design are introduced in detail. Prototype monitoring shows that the increment of the interfacial compressive stress is much larger in the impoundment stage than in the regulating stage. The water pressure and time-effect are two main factors affecting the interfacial stress. The time-effect is the key factor in the initial impoundment stage, and the water pressure is the key factor after impoundment. The contact properties are significantly improved by grouting. This study shows that there are three typical stages in the joint opening hydrographs, namely the compression stage, opening stage, and stable stage. There is a nonlinear relationship between the joint opening and temperature, which can be well described by the S-function. In conclusion, the reinforcement effect is satisfying, and the abutment is safe. Copyright © 2012 Editorial Office of Water Science and Engineering.

84866090197	Comprehensive evaluation methods for dam service status	More than 87000 dams have been built in China, and about one third of them are risky projects. A number of high and ultra- high dams are being constructed in China's western region. The current dam construction practice tends to focus on socio- economic benefits and neglect the environment and ecology. Furthermore, periodic examinations are intended to ensure the structural safety of dams. This paper proposes a general evaluation principle for dam service. This principle stipulates that dam projects should have maximum socio-economic benefits and minimum negative effects on the environment and ecology. To satisfy the general principle of mutual harmony, socio-economic benefits, dam safety, environment, and ecology are analyzed, and the evaluation methods for dam service status are discussed. Then, a fusion algorithm of interlayer assessment is proposed on the basis of evidence theory and the fuzzy comprehensive analysis method. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation model is established. Example analysis shows that the proposed theories and methods can fulfill scientific assessment of the service status of dams. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84867980116	A plastic damage model for concrete structure cracks with two damage variables	Based on the concepts of continuum damage theory, a new plastic damage model for concrete crack failure is developed through studying the basic damage mechanics. Two damage variables, tensile damage variable for tensile damage and shear damage variable for compressive damage, are adopted to represent the influence of microscopic damage on material macro-mechanics properties under tensile and compressive loadings. The yield criteria and flow rule determining the plasticity of concrete are established in the effective stress space, which is convenient to decouple the damage process from the plastic process and calibrate material parameters with experimental results. Meanwhile, the plastic part of the proposed model can be implemented by back-Euler implicit algorithm, and the damage part is explicit. Consequently, there exist robust algorithms for integrating the constitutive relations using finite element method. Comparison with several experimental results shows that the model is capable of simulating the nonlinear performance of concrete under multiaxial stress state and can be applied to practical concrete structures. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84869066174	Information fusion diagnosis and early-warning method for monitoring the long-term service safety of high dams	Analyzing the service behavior of high dams and establishing early-warning systems for them have become increasingly important in ensuring their long-term service. Current analysis methods used to obtain safety monitoring data are suited only to single survey point data. Unreliable or even paradoxical results are inevitably obtained when processing large amounts of monitoring data, thereby causing difficulty in acquiring precise conclusions. Therefore, we have developed a new method based on multi-source information fusion for conducting a comprehensive analysis of prototype monitoring data of high dams. In addition, we propose the use of decision information entropy analysis for building a diagnosis and early-warning system for the long-term service of high dams. Data metrics reduction is achieved using information fusion at the data level. A Bayesian information fusion is then conducted at the decision level to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis. Early-warning outcomes can be released after sorting analysis results from multi-positions in the dam according to importance. A case study indicates that the new method can effectively handle large amounts of monitoring data from numerous survey points. It can likewise obtain precise real-time results and export comprehensive early-warning outcomes from multi-positions of high dams. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84881274925	Deep stability evaluation of high-gravity dam under combining action of powerhouse and dam	The rock foundation of a gravity dam is usually cut into slide blocks by the structural surfaces. Its stability is controlled by the characteristics and the combining action of these structural surfaces. The failure of a gravity dam can be caused by the destruction or large deformation of local rocks under the condition of certain loads. The coupling of continuous-discontinuous deformation is a typical characteristic of the process. As a new design idea, the powerhouse and dam are combined into an integer with one structural pattern to improve the antisliding stability of the gravity dam. The external loads are undertaken together by the powerhouse and dam. The loads acting on the dam can be transferredpartly to the powerhouse, and the powerhouse weight and tail water pressure can increase the dam's stability. The optimal design of a gravity dam section can be implemented, decreasing the project quantity, and reducing construction costs. This design idea has been adopted by the Yangtze Three Gorges Project in China. The coupling methods of discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) and FEM are used to implement the deep antisliding stability evaluation for a gravity dam under the combining action of both the powerhouse and dam. The blocks are subdivided into the finite element meshes; the displacement field and stress field in the blocks are solved by FEM, and the contacts betweenthe deformable blocks are simulated and analyzed with theDDAmethod. The description ability for the block deformation can be increased, the calculation precision for the stress field in block can be improved, and the ability ofDDAin solving the large deformation of a multiblock system can be inherited. Therefore, the destructive form determined by this coupling method is closer to the actual situation. As an example, thecoupling methods ofDDAandFEMare used to analyze and assess the deep antisliding stability of the No. 3 left powerhouse-dam section of one dam when the upstream loads are taken together by the high gravity dam and the combined powerhouse located behind dam. The effect of combining the action of the powerhouse and dam is appraised by the numerical analysis for the mechanism transferring force between the dam and powerhouse, the influence on the deformation and stress of dam and powerhouse under the combining action of powerhouse and dam, the interaction of structural planes, etc. The entire instability process of the dam is simulated and analyzed by means of reducing the mechanical parameters. Last, the qualitative and quantitative analyses are implemented to evaluate the local and the whole stability of the gravity dam underthe combining action of the powerhouse and dam. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Wavelet neural network combines the time-frequency domain localization properties of wavelet transform and self-learning ability of traditional feed-forward neural network. Wavelet neural network is used to approximate the non-linear relation between factor of safety and control factors of rock slope stability. The stability of rock slope can be analyzed and forecasted with wavelet neural network trained by engineering case as learning samples. The numerical example shows that the precision of approximation and prediction of the proposed model can satisfy the quantitative evaluation for the stability of rock slopes. The model has the good capability of noise-resistance. Time-frequency analysis for training data is implemented to determine the original structure of wavelet network. A new method is proposed for iterative elimination of the redundant neurons. In this method, rough sets theory is used to calculate the dependency between the network output and the nodes in the hidden layer.
