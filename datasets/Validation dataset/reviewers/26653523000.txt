84930507337	Efficacy of autologous bone marrow buffy coat grafting combined with core decompression in patients with avascular necrosis of femoral head: A prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled study	Abstract Introduction: Avascular necrosis of femoral head (ANFH) is a progressive disease that often leads to hip joint dysfunction and even disability in young patients. Although the standard treatment, which is core decompression, has the advantage of minimal invasion, the efficacy is variable. Recent studies have shown that implantation of bone marrow containing osteogenic precursors into necrotic lesion of ANFH may be promising for the treatment of ANFH. Methods: A prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effect of bone-marrow buffy coat (BBC) grafting combined with core decompression for the treatment of ANFH. Forty-five patients (53 hips) with Ficat stage I to III ANFH were recruited. The hips were allocated to the control group (core decompression + autologous bone graft) or treatment group (core decompression + autologous bone graft with BBC). Both patients and assessors were blinded to the treatment options. The clinical symptoms and disease progression were assessed as the primary and secondary outcomes. Results: At the final follow-up (24 months), there was a significant relief in pain (P <0.05) and clinical joint symptoms as measured by the Lequesne index (P <0.05) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (P <0.05) in the treatment group. In addition, 33.3% of the hips in the control group have deteriorated to the next stage after 24 months post-procedure, whereas only 8% in the treatment group had further deterioration (P <0.05). More importantly, the non-progression rates for stage I/II hips were 100% in the treatment group and 66.7% in the control group. Conclusion: Implantation of the autologous BBC grafting combined with core decompression is effective to prevent further progression for the early stages of ANFH. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01613612. Registered 13 December 2011.

20544443993	Establishment of rat osteoarthritis model and stability	Aim: Osteoarthritis (OA) has been one of the diseases that serirously influence health and quality of life of human beings with the prolonging people's average life and social aging. The aim of this study was to establish an animal model of OA in rats so as to provide a basis for the rehabilitative intervention of OA. Methods: The study was completed in the Laboratory for Animals, College of Life Science, Nanjiang University from October 2003 to June 2004. Fifteen adult SD rats were used. Anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and partial meniscectomy of 1/3 inside were performed to one knee as experiment group, and the other knee was treated with nothing the control group. The rats were sent to a large cage, where they were free to move for a month. Results: The models were successfully established in 12 of the 15 rats, so they were qualified. Early changes of OA such as hyperplastic synovium, erosion on the surface of cartilage and loss of PG staining were found typically in the experiment group; no similar chages were found in the control group, with significant difference between them. Conclusion: The method of ACLT and partial meniscectomy of 1/3 inside for the knee of rats is satisfactory for the establishment of OA model in rats. This method is of the characters of short period, a little request for the breeding sites, low cost of animals and strong contrast of the control group. The model established is ideal for the application of recent molecular biology in the study of OA.

21744450580	Genistein derivatives as selective estrogen receptor modulators: Sonochemical synthesis and in vivo anti-osteoporotic action	Genistein derivatives were synthesized from genistein through a facile sonochemical approach in high yields. The bioassay was performed on ovariectomized (OVX) rats in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) and the weight of bone ash (WBA) to lead to the discovery of eight novel genistein-based selective estrogen receptor modulators. Attention to the structure-activity relationship disclosed that the newly introduced 2-hydroxyethylthio scaffolds were essential for the anti-osteoporotic activity. Moreover, the anti-osteoporotic action of genistein, deprivable by methylation, could be restored and enhanced by subsequent sulfonation. The most promising compound was 4′,5,7-tri[3-(2-hydroxyethylthio)propoxy]isoflavone, displaying 24% (or 8%) increment in BMD and 31% (or 11%) increase in WBA of the femora relative to those discerned with the OVX (or genistein) group. Acute toxicity test showed that none of the active compounds was acutely toxic. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33751300226	Replication of the association of the aspartic acid repeat polymorphism in the asporin gene with knee-osteoarthritis susceptibility in Han Chinese	A genetic association of osteoarthritis (OA) and functional polymorphisms in the aspartic acid (D) repeat of the asporin gene was reported in Japanese and European Caucasians; however, the results were controversial. Our objective was to evaluate whether the D repeat polymorphism was associated with knee OA in Han Chinese. The D repeat polymorphism was genotyped in 218 patients who suffered from primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation and in 454 age-matched controls, and the allelic association of the repeat was examined. Frequencies of the D13 and D14 alleles were similar to those of Japanese, but different from those of European Caucasians. The D14 allele was significantly over-represented in knee OA patients (P=0.0013; odds ratio 2.04; 95% confidence interval 1.32-3.15). D14 was more frequent in early-onset patients than in late-onset patients (P=0.043) and the age at onset in patients with D14 was earlier (P=0.028; log-rank test). Thus, the association of the D14 allele with knee OA susceptibility was replicated in Han Chinese. This was the first instance that association of the OA susceptibility gene was definitely replicated between different ethnic groups. © 2006 The Japan Society of Human Genetics and Springer.

33846286832	Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B signal transduction pathway in experimental osteoarthritis chondrocytes of rats	Aim: To verify the hypothesis that nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signal transduction pathway is activated in osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Methods: The experiment was carried out in the Animal Experiment Center of Life Science School, Nanjing University from July to September 2005. Twenty SPF SD rats were selected with the left knee as experiment group and the right knee as control group. 1 The osteoarthritis models were established by anterior cruciate ligament transection, and then Amikacin intraperitoneal injection (20 mg per rat) was given for 3 days to prevent inflammation. The control group was not given any treatment. 2 After 6 weeks of operation, all muscles around knee was cut off following anterior middle incision to cut down the femur above condyles, then the tibia was cut down 1 cm below tibial plateau. The articular capsule, lateral and medial collateral ligament were cut off to separate the femur and tibia. The proximal tibia was sent for pathological experiments and the distal femur was sent for molecular biological detections. The proximal tibia was put into 0.5 mol/L edathamil for decalcification for 8 weeks, and 5 μm pathological section was prepared. HE stain and toluidine blue stain were used to observe the damage degree of tibial cartilage. The activating level of femoral condyles chondrocytes NF-κB signal transduction pathway (p65 gray integral) was detected by Western-blot. Results: All 20 rats entered the result analysis. 1 Pathological results after 6 weeks of operation: The HE stain and toluidine blue stain showed that the joint surface of the control group was even, while it was seriously destroyed in the experiment group. 2 Comparison of results of the two p65 gray integrals: NF-κB p65 in the experiment group was higher expressed than in the control group (0.832±0.112, 0.372±0.081, P < 0.05). Conclusion: NF-κB signal transduction pathway is activated in experimental osteoarthritis chondrocytes of rats.

34447265958	Comparison of bone marrow versus explant culture methods for adult osteoblast	Aim: To compare the proliferation, differentiation, osteogenic ability, and morphology of primary osteoblast cultured by two methods, and look for a more simple and effective method for osteoblast culture. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Department of Scientific Research, Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Nanjing University from March to October 2006. 1 The cancellated bone of tibia and femur was harvested from the arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of a patient with anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament. The bone marrow of the same patient was collected for osteoblast culture. 2 In the same culture condition, the osteoblasts harvested from cancellated bone and marrow were primarily cultured with explant culture and bone marrow culture methods. 3 The morphological changes of primary osteoblast were, observed under inverted phase contrast microscope, and the number and percentage of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) stained positive cells were calculated by modified Gomori method. Cell proliferation curve was drawn by MTT assay. ALP content and proliferation of osteoblast were detected by NPP method. The osteogenic ability of osteoblast was compared by Von Kossa staining. Results: 1The result from inverted phase contrast microscope showed that there was no difference in cell shape by two methbds. 2The purification of osteoblast cultured with explant culture from cancellated bone was higher than that from marrow [(90±6)%, (68±10)%]. 3Results of MTT assay showed the proliferation of cells cultured with explant culture from cancellated bone was superior to that from marrow since the third day; ALP activity test suggested that the differentiation of osteoblast harvested from the marrow was more active than that from the cancellated bone. 4The quantity of mineralized nodules stained by Von Kossa was no difference [explant culture: (8±6)/sight; bone marrow: (12±3)/sight]. Conclusion: Explant culture and marrow culture have respective advantage and defect. Therefore, it is suitable to select the corresponding method according to empirical demand.

34547093391	Association of the aspartic acid-repeat polymorphism in the asporin gene with age at onset of knee osteoarthritis in Han Chinese Population	Recent genetic studies for osteoarthritis (OA) have been focused on ASPN, the gene encoding asporin, where aspartic acid (D)-repeat polymorphisms are associated with OA in several ethnic groups. The purpose of the present study is to further examine the association of the D-repeat polymorphism in a Han Chinese population. The D-repeat polymorphism was genotyped in 354 knee OA patients (257 women and 97 men) who suffered from primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation, and the association of the repeat with various clinical parameters was examined. The age at onset (years) in patients with the D14 allele (mean: 51.9, SD: 8.5) was younger than that those without the D14 allele (mean: 54.9, SD: 10.9) (P = 0.023). Survival analysis showed D14 was significantly associated with age at onset of OA (P = 0.004 in the dominant model). The average age at onset of patients with the D13/D13 genotype (mean: 56.1, SD: 11.1) was older than those without the D13/D13 genotype (mean: 53.0, SD: 9.9) (P = 0.013). Our study further highlighted the significance of asporin in OA. © 2007 The Japan Society of Human Genetics and Springer.

34547790324	Meta-analysis of association between the ASPN D-repeat and osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of human arthritis. Genetic factors have been implicated in OA. It was reported that an aspartic acid (D)-repeat polymorphism in the gene encoding asporin (ASPN) was associated with OA of knee and hip joints in Japanese; in the three independent studies performed, the D14 allele of the ASPN polymorphism was over-represented and the D13 allele was under-represented. Subsequently, four replication studies, three in Europeans and one in Chinese populations, have been reported; however, they showed inconsistent results. To evaluate between-study heterogeneity and to estimate the common genetic effect of the D-repeat polymorphism on OA, we performed a meta-analysis of the five reports that include seven association studies, using the DerSimonian-Laird procedure. We detected association between knee OA and the susceptible D14 allele [P = 0.003, summary odds ratio (OR) = 1.46] with significant heterogeneity (P = 0.047) among the studies. We also detected positive association between knee OA and the protective D13 allele (P = 0.026, summary OR = 0.84) with significant heterogeneity (P = 0.040) among the studies. Because of significant heterogeneity, we stratified the studies by ethnicity. We detected positive association between knee OA and the D14 allele (P = 0.0000013, summary OR = 1.95) with non-significant heterogeneity (P = 0.535) in Asian populations. In hip OA, significant heterogeneity was identified and there was no positive association for any allele in any comparison. The present results suggest that the association of the ASPN D14 allele and knee OA has global relevance, but that its effect has ethnic differences. © The Author 2007.

38849087358	Effects of infra-articular injection of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor on matrix metalloproteinase in articular cartilage of a rat model of osteoarthritis	Objective: To observe the effect of intra-articular injection of SB203580, a selective p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-13 in a rat model of osteoarthritis (OA) and to explore the relationship between the MMP-3/MMP-13 expressions and the severity of OA. Methods: Fourty SD rats underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and then randomly divided into four groups, with 10 rats in each group. Group A received 0.1 ml intra-articular injection of SB203580 at a high concentration of 100μmol/L (once a week) immediately after surgery, and group B were treated under the same condition using SB203580 with a low concentration of 10μmol/L. Group C received 0.1 ml intra-articular normal saline, and group D were not injected as controls after ACLT. All rats were sacrificed seven weeks after the surgery. Macroscopic and immunohistochemical studies were performed on the cartilage. Protein expressions of MMP-3 and MMP-13 were determined by Western blot. Results: Cartilage degradation was significantly milder in group A and group B than in the control groups, as shown by morphological studies (P < 0.05) and immunohistochemical studies (P < 0.05). The protein expressions of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in cartilage were significantly lower in groups A and B than in groups C and D (P < 0.01). Conclusion: SB203580 can inhibit the expressions of MMP-3 and MMP-13 and thus protect the cartilage.

38549178090	Lack of association of single nucleotide polymorphism in LRCH1 with knee osteoarthritis susceptibility	A genetic association of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and a C/T transition single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs912428) located in intron 1 of the LRCH1 gene has recently been reported in European Caucasians; however, the results are inconsistent. Our objective was to evaluate the association in different knee OA populations. Three case-control association studies were conducted in Han Chinese, Japanese, and Greek Caucasian populations. The LRCH1 SNP was genotyped in patients who had primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation and in matched controls, and the association was examined. We performed a meta-analysis for the studies together with results of two previous papers using the DerSimonian-Laird procedure and calculated the power of the pooled studies by the software R. A total of 1,145 OA patients and 1,266 controls were genotyped. No significant difference was detected in genotype or allele frequencies between knee OA and control groups in the three populations (all P > 0.05). Association was not observed even after stratification by gender and Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) scores. Meta-analysis also supported the lack of association between LRCH1 and knee OA. The strong heterogeneity between original and replication studies was detected in Caucasian populations. However, a tendency for the increase of TT genotype was observed in the European populations (OR = 1.46, P = 0.06). The powers for European and Asian replication studies were less than 0.8. Our results suggest that there is no association between LRCH1 and knee OA. However, lack of association should be concluded by further replication studies. © 2007 The Japan Society of Human Genetics and Springer.

79951853292	Recommendations for standardization and phenotype definitions in genetic studies of osteoarthritis: The TREAT-OA consortium	Objective: To address the need for standardization of osteoarthritis (OA) phenotypes by examining the effect of heterogeneity among symptomatic (SOA) and radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) phenotypes. Methods: Descriptions of OA phenotypes of the 28 studies involved in the TREAT-OA consortium were collected. We investigated whether different OA definitions result in different association results by creating various hip OA definitions in one large population based cohort (the Rotterdam Study I (RSI)) and testing those for association with gender, age and body mass index using one-way ANOVA. For ROA, we standardized the hip-, knee- and hand ROA definitions and calculated prevalence's of ROA before and after standardization in nine cohort studies. This procedure could only be performed in cohort studies and standardization of SOA definitions was not feasible at this moment. Results: In this consortium, all studies with SOA phenotypes (knee, hip and hand) used a different definition and/or assessment of OA status. For knee-, hip- and hand ROA five, four and seven different definitions were used, respectively. Different hip ROA definitions do lead to different association results. For example, we showed in the RSI that hip OA defined as " at least definite joint space narrowing (JSN) and one definite osteophyte" was not associated with gender (P =0.22), but defined as " at least one definite osteophyte" was significantly associated with gender (P=3×10

79951585162	Association of the D repeat polymorphism in the ASPN gene with developmental dysplasia of the hip: A case-control study in Han Chinese	Introduction: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common skeletal disease, which is characterized by abnormal seating of the femoral head in the acetabulum. Genetic factors play a considerable role in the etiology of DDH. Asporin (ASPN) is an ECM protein which can bind to TGF-β1 and sequentially inhibit TGF-β/Smad signaling. A functional aspartic acid (D) repeat polymorphism of ASPN was first described as an osteoarthritis-associated polymorphism. As TGF-β is well known as an important regulator in the development of skeletal components, ASPN may also be involved in the etiology of DDH. Our objective is to evaluate whether the D repeat polymorphism of ASPN is associated with DDH in Han Chinese.Methods: The D repeat polymorphism was genotyped in 370 DDH patients and 445 control subjects, and the allelic association of the D repeat was examined.Results: From D11 to D18, eight alleles were identified. D13 allele is the most common allele both in control and DDH groups, the frequencies are 67.3% and 58.1% respectively. In the DDH group, a significantly higher frequency of the D14 allele and significantly lower frequency of D13 was observed. The association of D14 and D13 was found in both females and males after stratification by gender. There was no significant difference in any other alleles we examined.Conclusions: Our results show an obvious association between the D repeat polymorphism of ASPN and DDH. It indicates that ASPN is an important regulator in the etiology of DDH. © 2011 Shi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84887462208	Lumbar disc degeneration is linked to a carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 variant	Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is associated with both genetic and environmental factors and affects many people worldwide. A hallmark of LDD is loss of proteoglycan and water content in the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. While some genetic determinants have been reported, the etiology of LDD is largely unknown. Here we report the findings from linkage and association studies on a total of 32,642 subjects consisting of 4,043 LDD cases and 28,599 control subjects. We identified carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3), an enzyme that catalyzes proteoglycan sulfation, as a susceptibility gene for LDD. The strongest genome-wide linkage peak encompassed CHST3 from a Southern Chinese family-based data set, while a genome-wide association was observed at rs4148941 in the gene in a meta-analysis using multiethnic population cohorts. rs4148941 lies within a potential microRNA-513a-5p (miR-513a-5p) binding site. Interaction between miR-513a-5p and mRNA transcribed from the susceptibility allele (A allele) of rs4148941 was enhanced in vitro compared with transcripts from other alleles. Additionally, expression of CHST3 mRNA was significantly reduced in the intervertebral disc cells of human subjects carrying the A allele of rs4148941. Together, our data provide new insights into the etiology of LDD, implicating an interplay between genetic risk factors and miRNA.

84897543670	Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in estrogen receptor alpha gene with susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis: A case-control study in a Chinese Han population	Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and its multifactorial nature has been increasingly recognized. Genetic factors play an important role in OA etiology and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) gene polymorphisms may be involved. This study tried to explore whether the ESR1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with primary knee OA in the Chinese Han population. Two SNPs, rs2234693 and rs9340799, were genotyped in 469 cases and 522 controls. Rs2234693 was associated with knee OA in the dominant genetic model (TT + TC versus CC) (P=0.025) and a higher T allele frequency existed (P=0.047) among females. The combined genotype (TT + TC) (P=0.025) and T allele (P=0.016) were related with mild knee OA only. For rs9340799, A allele was associated with knee OA in all subjects (P=0.031) and females (P=0.046). Statistical differences were detected in the dominant genetic model (AA + AG versus GG) among females (P=0.030). The combined genotype (AA + AG) (P=0.036) and A allele (P=0.039) were merely correlated with mild knee OA. ESR1 gene is considerably associated with knee OA etiology in the Chinese Han population. © 2014 Xiaoyu Dai et al.

43049122786	A meta-analysis of European and Asian cohorts reveals a global role of a functional SNP in the 5′ UTR of GDF5 with osteoarthritis susceptibility	We have performed a meta-analysis combining data for more than 11 000 individuals. It provides compelling evidence for a positive association between a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′-UTR of GDF5 (+104T/C; rs143383) and osteoarthritis (OA) in European and Asian populations. This SNP has recently been reported to be associated with OA in Japanese and Han Chinese populations. Attempts to replicate this association in European samples have been inconclusive, as no association was found in the case-control cohorts from the UK, Spain and Greece when studied individually. However, the pooled data of UK and Spain found an association of the T-allele with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.10. Although the European studies had adequate power to replicate the original findings from the Japanese cohort (OR = 1.79), these results suggest that the role of the GDF5 polymorphism may not be as strong in Europeans. To clarify whether the European studies were hampered by insufficient power, we combined new data from the UK and the Netherlands with the three published studies of Europe and Asia. The results provide strong evidence of a positive association of the GDF5 SNP with knee OA for Europeans as well as for Asians. The combined association for both ethnic groups is highly significant for the allele frequency model (P = 0.0004, OR = 1.21) and the dominant model (P < 0.0001, OR = 1.48). These findings represent the first highly significant evidence for a risk factor for the development of OA which affects two highly diverse ethnic groups. © The Author 2008.

44449135139	Association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in RHOB and TXNDC3 with knee osteoarthritis susceptibility: Two case-control studies in East Asian populations and a meta-analysis	Introduction: Conflicting findings on the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RHOB and TXNDC3 with susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis (OA) have been reported in European Caucasians. To examine the associations of these SNPs with OA in East Asian populations and to evaluate their global significance, we conducted two case-control studies in 955 Chinese and 750 Japanese patients. Methods: We genotyped the previously implicated SNPs rs585017 (in RHOB) and rs4720262 (in TXNDC3) in patients with primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation and in matched control individuals, and analyzed their associations. We further conducted a meta-analysis of the study findings together with those of previously reported European studies using the DerSimonian-Laird procedure. Results: A significant association of RHOB with knee OA was observed in male Chinese patients (P = 0.02). No significant associations were found for RHOB in any other comparisons in the East Asian populations. The association of TXNDC3 was replicated in Chinese female (P = 0.04) and Japanese (P = 0.03) patients, although none of these associations persisted after Bonferroni correction. Significant association (P = 0.02 for the allelic frequency) with nonsignificant heterogeneity was found in the East Asian replication study. No significant association was found in any comparison in the meta-analysis for all studies. Conclusion: Our study replicates the association, previously reported in European Caucasians, of TXNDC3 with knee OA susceptibility in an East Asian population. © 2008 Shi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

48349105759	Common variants in DVWA on chromosome 3p24.3 are associated with susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis	Susceptibility to osteoarthritis, the most common human arthritis, is known to be influenced by genetic factors. Through a genome-wide association study using ∼100,000 SNPs, we have identified a previously unknown gene on chromosome 3p24.3, DVWA, which is associated with susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis. Expressed specifically in cartilage, DVWA encodes a 276-amino-acid protein with two regions corresponding to the von Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA domain). Several DVWA SNPs are significantly associated with knee osteoarthritis in two independent Japanese case-control cohorts. This association was replicated in a Japanese population cohort and a Han Chinese case-control cohort (combined P = 7.3 × 10

55649089437	Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in growth differentiate factor 5 with congenital dysplasia of the hip: A case-control study	Introduction: Congenital dysplasia of the hip is an abnormal seating of the femoral head in the acetabulum, mainly caused by shallow acetabulum and lax joint capsule. Genetic factors play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of congenital dysplasia of the hip. The gene growth differentiate factor 5 (GDF5) has been implicated in skeletal development and joint morphogenesis in humans and mice. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′-untranslated region of GDF5 (rs143383) was reported to be associated with osteoarthritis susceptibility. As a key regulator in morphogenesis of skeletal components and soft tissues in and around the joints, GDF5 may be involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of congenital dysplasia of the hip. Our objective is to evaluate if the GDF5 SNP is associated with congenital dysplasia of the hip in people of Han Chinese origin. Methods: The GDF5 SNP was genotyped in 338 children with congenital dysplasia of the hip and 622 control subjects. Results: The SNP was significantly associated with congenital dysplasia of the hip (p = 0.0037; odds ration (OR) = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11 to 1.75). A significant difference was detected in female samples when stratified by gender (p = 0.0053; OR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.91), and in hip dislocation when stratified by severity (p = 0.0078; OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.85). Conclusions: Our results indicate that GDF5 is important in the aetiology of congenital dysplasia of the hip. To the authors' knowledge this is the first time that a definite association with the congenital dysplasia of the hip susceptibility has been detected. © 2008 Dai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

59849122690	Total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in 11 cases	From August 2000 to March 2006, 11 male patients (19 hips, average age of 38 years) with ankylosing spondilitis who underwent total hip arthroplasty were analyzed retrospectively with a follow-up period of 22 months to 7 years. The disease course was 4-31 years. Three patients had unilateral surgery, and 8 had bilateral one. Modified anterior lateral hip and lateral incision was used. The Harris grade system and X- ray examination were used to evaluate the curative effects. At the final follow-up, Harris hip score was improved from 34.2 to 85.5, and the postoperative movement range was significantly improved. Except for one hip dislocated at the early time after operation, there was no sign of prosthesis loosening. The incidence of heterotopic ossification was 10.5% (2 hips). Total hip arthroplasty can greatly relieve the pain of the patients, reconstruct the function of hip joint and improve the quality of life for patient with ankylosing spondilitis.

64549151355	Large replication study and meta-analyses of DVWA as an osteoarthritis susceptibility locus in European and Asian populations	Recently, through a genome wide association study in Japanese knee osteoarthritis (OA) cases, a previously unknown gene, DVWA, was identified. The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7639618 was subsequently found to be consistent and most significantly associated in Japanese and Han Chinese knee OA studies and functional relevant. Here, the association of the DVWA polymorphisms (rs7639618, rs11718863 and rs9864422) was genotyped in 1120 knee OA cases, 1482 hip OA cases and 2147 controls, all of white European descent from the Netherlands, the UK, Spain and Greece. Random effect DerSimonian and Laird meta-analyses were performed to assess the association in the different strata. To assess a more global effect, the original Japanese and Chinese data were included with the European. The meta-analyses provided evidence for global association of rs7639618 with knee OA with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.15-1.45 and a P-value of 2.70 × 10

67449128720	Testing the druggable endothelial differentiation gene 2 knee osteoarthritis genetic factor for replication in a wide range of sample collections	Objectives: To replicate a previously reported association with osteoarthritis (OA) of the promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10980705 in the endothelial differentiation gene 2 (EDG2). Methods: Five collections of samples, four from Europe and one from China, were studied. They included patients with 3 OA phenotypes: 1501 with knee OA, 1497 with hip OA and 376 with generalised OA. A total of 2521 controls were also studied. Allele and genotype frequencies of the rs10980705 SNP were analysed in each individual sample collection and in pooled data. In addition, a meta-analysis to incorporate results from the original Japanese report was performed. Results: The association of the rs10980705 SNP with knee OA was not replicated in any of the five sample collections studied or in their combined analysis (odds ratio (OR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.22; p = 0.10). Meta-analysis of all data, including the original Japanese study, did show association with knee OA (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.26; p = 0.002) but the effect was accounted for by the Japanese data and was less significant than the original report. No association was found with hip OA or with generalised OA. Conclusions: The original report of a promising genetic association between a druggable G-protein coupled receptor, EDG2, and knee OA has not been replicated. This lack of replication could be due to a modest effect of the promoter polymorphism that will require even larger studies (the winners curse) although a more pronounced effect in the Asian population vs Europeans cannot be excluded.

66449089103	Large-scale analysis of association between GDF5 and FRZB variants and osteoarthritis of the hip, knee, and hand	Objective. GDF5 and FRZB have been proposed as genetic loci conferring susceptibility to osteoarthritis (OA); however, the results of several studies investigating the association of OA with the rs143383 polymorphism of the GDF5 gene or the rs7775 and rs288326 polymorphisms of the FRZB gene have been conflicting or inconclusive. To examine these associations, we performed a large-scale meta-analysis of individual-level data. Methods. Fourteen teams contributed data on polymorphisms and knee, hip, and hand OA. For rs143383, the total number of cases and controls, respectively, was 5,789 and 7,850 for hip OA, 5,085 and 8,135 for knee OA, and 4,040 and 4,792 for hand OA. For rs7775, the respective sample sizes were 4,352 and 10,843 for hip OA, 3,545 and 6,085 for knee OA, and 4,010 and 5,151 for hand OA, and for rs288326, they were 4,346 and 8,034 for hip OA, 3,595 and 6,106 for knee OA, and 3,982 and 5,152 for hand OA. For each individual study, sex-specific odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each OA phenotype that had been investigated. The ORs for each phenotype were synthesized using both fixed-effects and random-effects models for allele-based effects, and also for haplotype effects for FRZB. Results. A significant random-effects summary OR for knee OA was demonstrated for rs143383 (1.15 [95% confidence interval 1.09-1.22]) (P = 9.4 × 10

69049113951	Genetic polymorphisms of interleukin-1β (-511C/T) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (86-bpVNTR) in susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis in a Chinese Han population	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial disorder in which genetic factors act as important contributors to its onset and progression. Associations between genetic polymorphisms of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) gene cluster and OA susceptibility have been studied continuously in different ethnic groups, yielding controversial results. This study investigated the association of interleukin-1β (-511C/T) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (86-bp VNTR) polymorphisms with knee OA susceptibility in a Chinese Han population. A case-control association study was conducted. The two polymorphisms were genotyped in 453 patients who had primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation and in 487 matched controls. Allelic and genotypic frequencies and haplotype distribution were compared between OA and control subjects. For either of the two loci, no significant difference was detected in genotype or allele distribution between knee OA and control groups (all P > 0.05). The haplotype distribution of the two loci showed no difference between the two groups, either. Furthermore, no association between the genotype of the -511 and VNTR polymorphisms and the clinical variables, age, sex, body mass index and Kellgren/Lawrence score was observed in OA patients. The genetic polymorphisms of interleukin-1β and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist are not risk factors for OA etiology in Han Chinese. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77949438627	Lack of evidence for association between DVWA gene polymorphisms and developmental dysplasia of the hip in Chinese Han population	Developmental dysplasia of the hip is the most frequent inborn deformity of the locomotor apparatus. Genetic factors play a considerable role in pathogenesis of Developmental dysplasia of the hip. Recently, several DVWA SNPs were found to be consistent and most significantly associated in Japanese and Han Chinese knee OA studies. Its functions may be associated with cartilage. It may be involved in etiology and pathogenesis of Developmental dysplasia of the hip. Our objective is to evaluate whether the DVWA SNPs (rs7639618, rs9864422 and rs11718863) are associated with Developmental dysplasia of the hip in Han Chinese. Three SNPs rs7639618, rs9864422 and rs11718863 (in DVWA) were genotyped using a Taqman 5′ allelic discrimination assay on an ABI 7500 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument in 368 children who suffered from Developmental dysplasia of the hip and 508 control subjects, and analyzed their associations. The genotype distribution and allele frequency were compared between Developmental dysplasia of the hip and healthy control. Neither genotype distributions nor allelic frequencies of the assayed single nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be significantly different between patients and controls. There was also no significant difference when the patients were stratified by sex or severity (all P > 0.05). Our results indicate that DVWA does not seem to be a risk factor for Developmental dysplasia of the hip etiology in Chinese Han population. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78049293809	Association of the leptin gene with knee osteoarthritis susceptibility in a Han Chinese population: A case-control study	Previous studies have suggested that leptin works as a key regulator in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), and genetic factors modulate OA. This study assessed the contribution of leptin gene (LEP) polymorphism(s) to knee OA among Han Chinese. Three tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering all those LEP SNPs of which the minor allele frequencies were over 10% were selected. Study subjects (697 patients and 699 controls) were divided into four groups (underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese) by body mass index (BMI).

78149406119	Association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HLA class II/III region with knee osteoarthritis	Objective: A genome-wide association study and a replication using Japanese, Spanish and Greek Caucasian populations have recently indicated two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7775228 and rs10947262) associated with knee Osteoarthritis (OA) susceptibility. We have further evaluated the association in knee OA subjects from Han Chinese and Australian Caucasian origin. Methods: Two independent case-control association studies were performed using Han Chinese and Australian Caucasian populations. The two SNPs were genotyped in patients who had primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation and/or received total knee replacement surgery as well as in matched controls. They were subjected to statistic analyses. Results: A total of 991 OA patients and 1536 controls were genotyped. No significant difference was detected in genotype or allele frequencies of the two SNPs between knee OA and control groups in the two populations (all P>0.05). The association was also negative even after stratification by sex, body mass index (BMI) and Kellgren/Lawrence scores. The significant heterogeneity was detected between Chinese and Japanese (both P<0.05). In the Caucasian samples, no significant heterogeneity was detected (both P>0.05). The result of meta-analysis showed significant association between knee OA and rs10947262 in total subjects [summary OR=1.26, 95%confidence intervals (CI)=1.07-1.27, P=3×10

78649692441	Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in Tbx4 with developmental dysplasia of the hip: A case-control study	Objective: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), formerly known as congenital dislocation of the hip, comprises a spectrum of abnormalities, including abnormal acetabular shape (dysplasia) and malposition of the femoral head during embryonic, fetal and infantile growth periods. Genetic factors play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of DDH. As a key regulator for the hindlimb outgrowth and identification, Tbx4 may be involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of DDH. Our objective is to evaluate whether the Tbx4 (rs3744438 and rs3744448) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with DDH in Chinese. Method: The Tbx4 SNPs were genotyped in 505 children with DDH and 551 control subjects and their association was evaluated statistically. Results: Rs3744438 was not associated with DDH. Rs3744448 was significantly associated with DDH in the dominant genetic model of males (P=0.039; odds ratio (OR)=0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.32-0.97) and allele G was significantly lower in patients than controls compared with allele C (P=0.02; OR=0.59; 95% CI=0.37-0.92). After adjusted for gender, we discovered a significant association with hip dislocation in the dominant genetic model when stratified by severity (P=0.03; OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.55-0.97), but not with subluxation and instability. Conclusions: Tbx4 tends to play an important role in the aetiology of DDH. © 2010.

78650977422	Genetic polymorphism of PITX1 in susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis in a Chinese Han population: A case-control study	Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and the precise etiology of this disease remains unclear. Genetic factors play a considerable role in pathogenesis of OA. Several OA-susceptibility genes have been identified. Recently, a new emerging role of pitx1 transcription factor in OA pathogenesis has been reported. Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) has been implicated in hind limb development of mice and is essential to maintain cartilage function. Because of the different expression in the knee joint between OA and normal people, PITX1 may be involved in etiology and pathogenesis of OA. The present study is to evaluate the association of the PITX1 polymorphism (rs479632) with knee OA in a Chinese Han population. A case-control association study was conducted. The polymorphism was genotyped in 581 patients who had primary symptomatic knee OA with radiographic confirmation and in 570 matched controls. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between patients and control subjects. No significant difference was detected in genotype or allele distribution between knee OA and control groups (all P > 0.05). The association was also negative even after stratification by sex. Furthermore, no association between the SNP genotype and the clinical variables age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) score was observed in OA patients. The present study suggests that the PITX1 polymorphism (rs479632) is not a risk factor for knee OA susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Further studies are needed to give a global view of this polymorphism in pathogenesis of OA. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79953039983	Association Between Deep Vein Thrombosis and the Temperature at the Popliteal Fossa During Cement Curing in Total Knee Arthroplasty	The temperature at the popliteal fossa during cement curing and its relationship with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has not been investigated. Fifty-six consecutive patients who underwent primary TKA were recruited. The temperatures at the popliteal fossa were measured during bone cement exothermic polymerization. Postoperative operated leg ascending venographies were performed 5 days after TKA for screening of DVT. The maximum temperatures were 32.5°C ± 1.0°C at the popliteal fossa during cement curing. No significant difference was found of the maximum temperatures in the popliteal fossa between the non-DVT and DVT groups. The present study indicated that the heat resulting from polymerization of the cement may not be a possible cause of damage to the veins surrounding the knee, and it may have no relationship with DVT. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79953686844	Clinical outcome of Zweymüller total hip arthroplasty for patients with high congenital hip dislocation	Treatment of high congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) remains controversial. We report the outcome of hip arthroplasty using a cementless threaded cup and a cementless straight stem in patients with high congenital hip dislocation. Between January 2001 and August 2004, 17 patients with high congenital hip dislocation were treated. During surgery, at least 25% of the cup was anchored in bone. By monitoring somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) of the common peroneal nerve we were able to reduce the femoral head into position in the true acetabulum by releasing soft tissues. A bulk autogenous femoral head bone graft was implanted in 5 patients to achieve at least 75% bony coverage of the acertabular component. Follow-up ranged from 48 months to 91 months with an average of 69.7 months. The mean Harris hip score increased from 43 points preoperatively to 89 points at the time of final follow-up (P<0.001). Radiographic analysis showed bony union of the bone graft in all cases. © 2011 Wichtig Editore.

84862772786	A large-scale replication study for the association of rs17039192 in HIF-2α with knee osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease with a genetic component for its etiology. Recently, a genetic association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17039192 in HIF-2α with knee OA has been reported in a Japanese population; however, controversy exits for its replication and a role of HIF-2α in OA. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the SNP by a large-scale replication study. A total of 8,457 subjects (3,129 OA cases and 5,328 controls) from seven independent cohorts from six countries (Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Greece, and Australia) were recruited and genotyped. The association of rs17039192 with knee OA was evaluated by meta-analyses. The association of the HIF-2α SNP was not replicated in any of the populations. Contrary to the previous report, the odds ratios (ORs) of the risk allele frequency were all less than 1. A combined analysis for the seven populations also showed no replication of the association (OR=0.91, 95% confidence interval=0.81-1.03). Our large-scale meta-analysis showed that the association of rs17039192 in HIF-2α with knee OA is negative. The significance of HIF-2α in human OA (idiopathic OA as a common disease) should be further evaluated carefully. Copyright © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

84864035162	The anatomy of proximal femoral autografts for pelvic reconstruction: A cadaveric study	Purpose: One important reconstruction procedure following pelvic tumor resection is ipsilateral femoral autograft reconstruction in which the autograft is transposed onto the defect and a conventional total hip replacement is implanted in the autograft. The purpose of this study is to provide anatomical evidence for this reconstruction by measurement of proximal femoral autografts. Methods: The anatomical study of proximal femoral autografts was performed on thirteen fresh-frozen Chinese male cadavers. Four parameters were measured and included the diameter of the femoral head (DFH), the distance from the apex of the greater trochanter perpendicular to the medial cortex edge of the femoral neck (DAM), the length between the apex of the femoral head and the midpoint of osteotomy line under the lesser trochanter (LAM), and the width of the greater trochanter from anterior to posterior (WG). The correlation between height and each of the various parameters was analyzed using the Spearman's correlation. Results: The median (Wrst and third quartile) values of the measurements for the above mentioned parameters were 49 mm (48-52.7 mm), 58.5 mm (54.5-60.9 mm), 102 mm (96-105.2 mm) and 48 mm (46.5-51 mm), respectively. There was a positive correlation between height and each of these four parameters (P < 0.05). Conclusions The proximal femoral autograft reconstruction may be a good option after resection of a pelvic tumor because of the provision of biological reconstruction. However, an individual preoperative plan should be carefully performed following evaluating the size of the bone defect after tumor resection and height and width of the remaining greater trochanter prior to conventional hip replacement. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84864230489	Association of estrogen receptor alpha gene polymorphisms with bone mineral density: A meta-analysis	Background A number of studies have examined the association between estrogen receptor alpha (ESR-α) gene polymorphisms and bone mineral density (BMD), but previous studies of ESR-α gene XbaI (rs9340799) and PvuII (rs2234693) polymorphisms have been hampered by small sample size, regional restrictions and inconclusive results. Thus a meta-analysis is needed to assess their pooled effects. Methods This study reviewed all published articles indexed in Pubmed using the keywords in the title or abstract. All data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standard form, the studies were meta-analyzed and minor discrepancies were resolved by authors' discussion. Results Twenty seven eligible studies involving 8467 women and 2032 men were identified. The XbaI and PvuII polymorphisms were significantly associated with BMD of the lumbar spine. XX and PP homozygotes had a protective effect in comparison with carriers of the x and p alleles, the effects were more significant in premenopausal women or Western women. At the femoral neck, the results were different. XX served as a protective factor in postmenopausal women, Western women, Western postmenopausal women, and men, while PP was likely to serve as a risk factor in Eastern women, Eastern postmenopausal women, and men. Conclusions The XbaI polymorphism is correlated to BMD at diverse skeletal sites. PP had a protective role for the lumbar spine but might be a risk factor for the femoral neck.

DDH has a considerable genetic component. Design We reviewed the recent progress on genetic study of DDH. Results By linkage and case-control association studies, DDH loci have been identified with several susceptibility genes that involve in bone and joint biology; however, no unequivocal genes with global significance have been detected. The current problem of the association study in DDH is discussed. Conclusions By advanced technologies and international collaboration, we need to find more susceptibility genes and bridge the gap between genetic evidence and molecular mechanisms. © 2012 The Authors.

84868507424	Biomarkers of deep venous thrombosis	Deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which is associated with pulmonary embolism, is a fatal disease because of its high morbidity and mortality in outpatients and inpatients, especially in hospitalized patients. At the same time, lack of subjective clinical symptoms and objective clinical signs makes the diagnosis complicated. Historically, the primarily imaging modalities, including duplex ultrasound, helical CT scans, and venography, establish the diagnosis of DVT. Currently, both imaging modalities and serology are utilized. These plasma molecules are regarded as the biomarkers of DVT including D-dimer, P-selectin, Factor VIII, thrombin generation, inflammatory cytokines, microparticles, fibrin monomer, leukocyte count and so on. This brief review is used to analyze the contribution of the biomarkers to diagnosis and guidance of therapy for DVT. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84871613543	Case report: Osteochondral avulsion fracture of the posteromedial bundle of the PCL in knee hyperflexion	Background: Injury of the PCL of the knee in adults usually results in rupture rather than avulsion fracture and avulsions usually occur at the tibial insertion. Case Description We report an avulsion of the PCL with a femoral origin in a 22-year-old man who was injured by hyperflexion of the knee and was treated with arthroscopy. There were two parts in the partial osteochondral avulsion fracture of the PCL posteromedial (PM) bundle. One part was fixed with polydioxanone suture through drill holes and the other was removed. The fracture healed after 3 months and the knee was stable. At 11 months postoperatively the patient had returned to full-time work without pain or restrictions. The Lysholm II knee score was 95 points. Physical examination showed a negative posterior drawer sign. Literature Review We identified four other reported cases of PCL femoral origin avulsion fractures in adults. The subjects were 20 to 25 years old in four of five reports, including our patient. Three of the five patients had involvement of only the lateral cortex of the medial femoral condyle whereas two other patients including our patient, had an osteochondral fracture. The mechanism of PCL avulsion seems to be similar to that of a PCL rupture. Purposes and Clinical Relevance The hyperflexion injury may result in injury of the PM bundle of the PCL. Our case and one other in the literature suggest such avulsions need not involve the entire PCL. © The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons® 2012.

84871645791	Intravenous release of NO from lipidic microbubbles accelerates deep vein thrombosis resolution in a rat model	Objective: The experiment was designed to analyze whether and how Nitric Oxide (NO) microbubbles facilitates deep vein thrombosis (DVT) resolution in a rat model. Methods and Results: DVT was induced by ligation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and left common iliac vein (LCIV) in a rat model. The rats were sacrificed at day 2 and day 8 after ligation. NO was wrapped in lipidic microbubbles which were injected (1.6 ml/kg) via tail vein twice a day. Thrombi isolated from IVC were measured by weight (g) and weight length ratio (g/cm).The histological analysis of LCIV indicated that platelets and inflammatory cells aggregation were reduced. The expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was quantified by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and western blot. The coagulation functions including prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT),activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) were tested as well.Vein walls from IVC were processed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for several endothelial genes including matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), thrombomodulin (TM), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The thrombus weight and the expression of VCAM-1 significantly decreased after NO microbubbles treatment. The expression of these endothelial genes were significantly up-regulated by NO micribubbles. There was no statistical difference among the groups in terms of PT, APTT, and TT. Conclusion: NO microbubbles significantly facilitate DVT resolution in a rat model. The antithrombotic properties of NO microbubbles may be associated with reduced platelets and inflammatory cells aggregation, enhanced collagen turnover and stimulus to an anticoagulant condition of endothelium. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84880776931	Genetic Polymorphism of NOS3 with Susceptibility to Deep Vein Thrombosis after Orthopedic Surgery: A Case-Control Study in Chinese Han Population	Deep vein thrombosis is one of the common complications of orthopedic surgery. Studies indicated that genetic factors played a considerable role in the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase which encoded by nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), can generate nitric oxide in endothelial cells. As a predominant regulator for vascular homeostasis, nitric oxide might be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombosis. It had been proved that the NOS3 polymorphism (rs1799983) was associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases. Our objective was to evaluate the association between the NOS3 polymorphism (rs1799983) and deep vein thrombosis after orthopedic surgery in Chinese Han population. The polymorphism was genotyped in 224 subjects with deep vein thrombosis after orthopedic surgery and 580 controls. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between subjects with deep vein thrombosis and control subjects. The allele and genotype frequencies of the NOS3 polymorphism (rs1799983) were significantly different between subjects with deep vein thrombosis and control subjects. There were also significant differences when the subjects were stratified by gender, surgery type and hypertension status. These findings suggested that the NOS3 polymorphism (rs1799983) was associated with susceptibility to the deep vein thrombosis after orthopedic surgery in Chinese Han population, and NOS3 might play a role in the development of deep vein thrombosis after orthopedic surgery. © 2013 Qin et al.

Plasma D-dimer levels were obtained preoperatively and at days 1, 3, and 7 postoperatively in 83 consecutive patients undergoing THA treated with nadroparin prophylaxis plus intermittent pneumatic compression. Unilateral ascending venography was performed at postoperative day 7 or 8. There was a significant difference between the D-dimer levels in the DVT group (28 patients) and non-DVT group (55 patients) on each day (P<0.01). ROC analysis showed the AUC on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 was 0.706, 0.712 and 0.772 respectively. The D-dimer concentration on postoperative day 1, day 3 or day 7 is of moderate predicting value of DVT in patients undergoing THA, treated with nadroparin prophylaxis plus intermittent pneumatic compression. © 2013 Wichtig Editore.

It comprises a spectrum of abnormalities, including shallow acetabulum and decreased coverage of the femoral head. Genetic component plays a considerable role in the aetiology of DDH. HOXB9 may be involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of DDH, as it plays an important role in the development of the limbs. Our objective was to evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HOXB9 (rs2303486 and rs8844) were associated with DDH in Chinese population. The HOXB9 tag SNPs were genotyped in 460 DDH cases and 562 control subjects by Taqman assay, and their association was examined. rs8844 was not associated with DDH. rs2303486 was associated with DDH in the dominant genetic model (p = 0.037; odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.71). After stratification by sex, significant association of the dominant genetic model still existed in the female subjects (p = 0.015; OR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.08-1.98), but not in the male subjects. After stratification by severity, we discovered an association with hip dislocation in the dominant model (p = 0.042; OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.01-1.80), but not with subluxation or instability.

84892097553	Chronic inflammation of osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA, OMIM 165720) is one of the most common skeletal diseases characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage in synovial joints. OA is the most common cause of limitation of activities of daily living after the middle age. Spine, hip, knee, hand and ankle OA are more popular than other parts of human body. Environmental and genetic factors play important roles in OA pathology. Current treatment efficacy of OA is limited to relievingpain, improving range of motion, and/or promoting partialregeneration in most cases. Current therapeutic strategiesfor restoration of articular cartilage function include nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical proceduressuch as arthroscopy and arthroplasty. Strategy to regenerate cartilage afflicted with OA may be developed in the near future. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we synthesized a novel compound N-(3-(cyclohexylcarbamoyl) phenyl)-1H-indole-2- carboxamide (termed as OA-4) and investigated the effects of OA-4 on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts. OA-4 markedly diminished osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast specific gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, OA-4 dose-dependently suppressed osteoclastic bone resorption. Furthermore, we found OA-4 attenuated RANKL-induced p38 phosphorylation without affecting JNK or NF-κB signaling pathways. Collectively, we synthesized a novel compound OA-4 which can inhibit osteoclast formation and functions via the suppression of p38 signaling pathway. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

84895549400	OA10 is a novel p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor that suppresses osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption	In search of anti-bone resorbing agents for the potential treatment of osteoporosis, we synthesized a novel compound Tert-butyl 4-(3-[1H-indole-2- carboxamido]benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (OA10) and found that OA10 is capable of inhibiting RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation and osteoclastic bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner. This biological effect is further supported by the fact that OA10 suppressed osteoclastic-specific gene expression, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin K receptor, and calcitonin receptor. Further molecular mechanism investigation revealed OA10 inhibited p38 phosphorylation, suppressed c-fos and NFATc1 expression without affecting NF-κB or JNK signaling pathways. Taken together, this study suggested that OA10 can inhibit osteoclastogenesis by suppressing p38-c-Fos-NFATc1 cascade. OA10 may be developed as a therapeutic drug for osteoclast-related osteolytic diseases. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84896811821	A replication study for the association of rs726252 in PAPPA2 with developmental dysplasia of the hip in chinese han population	Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common developmental hip disorder, which ranges from mild acetabulum malformation to irreducible hip dislocation. A previous study suggested a significant association of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2 (PAPPA2) with DDH susceptibility in Chinese Han population. But with the consideration of the sample size, the association was still debatable. To confirm the association of the reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PAPPA2, rs726252 with DDH, we conducted a case-control study in a larger number of subjects. We genotyped rs726252 in 697 DDH subjects and 707 control subjects by TaqMan assay. The association between this SNP and DDH was evaluated statistically. No significant difference was found in any comparison of genotype distribution nor allele frequency between cases and controls. Our replication study indicated that the association between rs726252 and DDH in Chinese Han population was debatable. The association between PAPPA2 and DDH should be evaluated by additional studies. © 2014 Dongquan Shi et al.

84896830971	Deep venous thrombosis after knee arthroscopy: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Purpose: To establish a contemporary literature-based estimate of the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after knee arthroscopic surgery. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the English language literature to assess the efficacy of prophylaxis to prevent DVT after knee arthroscopic surgery. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective studies were considered. Studies were excluded if they were not original prospective studies concerning DVT detected by imaging after knee arthroscopic surgery. We calculated pooled proportions of postoperative DVT and proximal DVT. Results: Nine prospective uncontrolled studies and 4 RCTs were retrieved. Within them, the populations given low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to prevent DVT had a 0.1% to 11.9% incidence of DVT, with an overall 36 DVTs identified (4 proximal), averaging 1.8%. One hundred thirty-six DVTs (29 proximal) were indicated in the populations without prophylaxis, and the DVT incidence varied from 1.8% to 41.2%, averaging 6.8%. Of the RCTs, the pooled risk ratio for DVT to develop was 0.180 (range, 0.065 to 0.499) for those who had LMWH as prophylaxis. An absolute risk reduction of 1.2% - from 1.5% to 0.3% - for the development of proximal DVT was observed. Conclusions: Compared with patients who did not receive prophylaxis, the pooled risk ratio for the development of DVT was 0.18 for those who had LMWH prophylaxis. The incidence of proximal DVT is very low after arthroscopic surgery regardless of receiving prophylaxis (4 of 2,184) or not (29 of 1,814). The rate of proximal DVT in total DVT occurrence can be markedly reduced from 21.3% (29 of 136) to 11.1% (4 of 36). © 2014 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.

84903270332	Incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic venous thromboembolism after elective knee arthroscopic surgery: A retrospective study with routinely applied venography	Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of total venous thromboembolism (VTE) after knee arthroscopy with routinely applied venography. Methods We reviewed 537 consecutive patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery from March 2012 to July 2013. The surgical procedure was categorized as simple anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR), or reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments. All patients having arthroscopy in our institution were routinely examined with venography on the third postoperative day. Clinical signs of DVT were checked and recorded before venography. Results Eighty (14.9%) of 537 patients were diagnosed with VTE by venography. Of the 80 detected cases of VTE, only 20 (3.7%) patients presented with clinical signs of DVT, indicating that there were 60 (11.2%) asymptomatic cases. No patient died or presented with a clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Sex, body mass index (BMI), operative time, and duration of tourniquet application were not significant risk factors for DVT. Patient age (P <.0001) is a strongly significant risk factor for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Compared with patients who underwent simple arthroscopic procedures, complex procedures - the reconstruction of 1 (P <.005) or both knee cruciate ligaments (P <.0005) - led to a significantly higher postoperative incidence of DVT. Conclusions The total incidence of VTE diagnosed with venography after arthroscopic knee surgery was 14.9%, of which only 3.7% of cases were symptomatic, indicating 11.2% cases of silent VTE. Advanced age and complex arthroscopic surgery are strongly associated with VTE. Level of Evidence Level IV, prognostic case series. © 2014 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.

84903641454	Comparison of venous thromboembolism after total hip arthroplasty between ankylosing spondylitis and osteoarthritis	Objective. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an inflammatory rheumatic disease, will gradually lead to severe hip joint dysfunction. Total hip arthroplasty is a useful method to improve patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence and risk factors of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) between AS and hip osteoarthritis. Methods. In a retrospective study, a total of 149 subjects who underwent cementless THA were studied. Clinical data, biochemical data, and surgery-related data were measured between AS and OA groups. Results. The incidence of DVT in AS group was lower than that of OA group, although no significant difference was detected (P = 0.89). The patients of AS group were much younger (P < 0.0001) and thinner (P = 0.018) compared with those of OA group. AS patients had higher ejection fraction (EF) (P = 0.016), higher platelet counts (P < 0.0001), and lower hypertension rate (P = 0.0004). The values of APTT, PT, and INR in AS patients were higher than those in OA patients (all P < 0.0001). The values of D-dimer and APTT were both significantly higher in DVT subjects than those in non-DVT subjects. Conclusion. AS patients potentially had a lower incidence of DVT compared with OA patients. © 2014 Dongquan Shi et al.

84904739341	Diffusion tensor imaging for anatomical and quantitative evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament and ACL grafts: A preliminary study	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and ACL graft could be imaged using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to provide the DTI metrics for ACL and grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and DTI were performed in 40 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with ACL reconstruction. Fiber tracking and other postprocessing steps were performed on the workstation. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of ACL and grafts were determined. RESULTS: The courses of ACL and grafts were analyzed quantitatively using FA and ADC, and tractography illustrated nicely the 3-dimensional courses of the fiber bundles and corresponded well to the known anatomy. There was no significant difference in the mean FA and ADC values of the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to image and visualize the structure of ACL and ACL grafts.

84904111531	P-selectin: An unpredicted factor for deep vein thrombosis after total hip arthroplasty	Introduction. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a severe complication after total hip arthroplasty (THA). It leads to acute pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening disease. P-selectin is a 140-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. Elevated P-selectin was associated with 1.7-fold increase in the risk of venous thrombosis. Materials and Methods. To confirm the association, a total of 91 subjects who received primary total hip arthroplasty using lateral approach performed by one skilled orthopedic surgeon were studied. All the patients were consecutively enrolled at the Center of Diagnosis and Treatment for Joint Diseases, Drum Tower Hospital affiliated to the Medical School of Nanjing University from 2010 to 2012. All the subjects received venography 3-5 days after operation. We measured P-selectin by means of a highly sensitive sandwich ELISA technique and a commercially available test reagent set. Results. No significant association was detected between P-selectin and DVT (all P values>0.05). ΔsP-selectin was correlated with weight, APTT after operation, history of DVT, and diagnosis of primary disease (P values were 0.03, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.02, resp.). Conclusion. P-selectin may not be a predicted factor for deep vein thrombosis after total hip arthroplasty. © 2014 Dongquan Shi et al.

84905730971	The prevention of titanium-particle-induced osteolysis by OA-14 through the suppression of the p38 signaling pathway and inhibition of osteoclastogenesis	Wear-particle-induced osteolysis leads to prosthesis loosening, which is one of the most common causes of joint-implant failure, a problem that must be fixed using revision surgery. Thus, a potential treatment for prosthetic loosening is focused on inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption, which prevents wear-particle-induced osteolysis. In this study, we synthesized a compound named OA-14 (N-(3- (dodecylcarbamoyl)phenyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamide) and examined how OA-14 affects titanium (Ti)-particle-induced osteolysis and osteoclastogenesis. We report that OA-14 treatment protected against Ti-particle-induced osteolysis in a mouse calvarial model. Interestingly, the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts decreased after treatment with OA-14 invivo, which suggested that OA-14 inhibits osteoclast formation. To test this hypothesis, we conducted invitro studies, and our results revealed that OA-14 markedly diminished osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast-specific gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, OA-14 suppressed osteoclastic bone resorption and F-actin ring formation. Furthermore, we determined that OA-14 inhibited osteoclastogenesis by specifically blocking the p38-Mitf-c-fos-NFATc1 signaling cascade induced by RANKL (ligand of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). Collectively, our results suggest that the compound OA-14 can be safely used for treating particle-induced peri-implant osteolysis and other diseases caused by excessive osteoclast formation and function. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84921472420	Comparative study of CT and magnetic resonance imaging for postoperative evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction	Objective: To compare the application value of CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the postoperative evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and to explore the clinical application of new imaging technologies. Methods: Fifteen patients who underwent ACL reconstruction by the autologous tendon were scanned by spiral CT, routine MRI, and MR diffusion tensor imaging. The grafts and surrounding structures were observed and scored by two evaluation methods by one radiologist and one orthopedist. Results: The bone tunnel, screw, and interface were clearly and directly displayed by CT curve planar reconstruction. The multiple planar reconstruction was helpful for displaying the contour of the graft and the osterophyte of the inter-condylar notch. The volume render technique could display the relationship of tunnel aperture and intercondylar eminence at any angle. MRI clearly displayed the fiber bundle of graft and provided quantitative data. Scores of the continuity and density/signal uniformity of graft and articular cavity and surrounding structure of CT were lower than those of MRI (P=0.001). Scores of the position of tunnel aperture, screw, shape of inter-condylar notch, and surrounding bone mineral density of CT were higher than those of MRI (P=0.001). The difference of scores of bone tunnel diameter measurements of CT and MRI was not statistically significant (P=0.102). Conclusion: CT 3D reconstruction technology is better than MRI for observing the position of tunnel aperture, measuring the internal diameter of tunnel, and evaluating surrounding bone mineral density, while MRI is more sensitive to the shape and internal pathological changes of the graft. The postoperative evaluation of ACL reconstruction can be more straightforward and objective by CT and MRI.

84924245230	Histone deacetylase 4 alters cartilage homeostasis in human osteoarthritis	Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disorder, and a major cause of pain and disability among the elderly. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) has been shown to be a key regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy during skeletogenesis. The aims of present study were to investigate the expression of HDAC4 in normal and OA cartilage and its potential roles during OA pathogenesis. Methods: The knee cartilage specimen (a total of 18, 12 female and 6 male) were obtained from primary OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and normal donors. By using immunohistochemistry staining, we detected the expression patterns of HDAC4 in OA cartilage and normal cartilage respectively. To assess the potential roles of HDAC4, HDAC4 expression in human chondrosarcoma cells (SW1353) was down-regulated by transfecting small interference RNA (siRNA), thereafter, cells were treated with IL-1β or TNF-α, and the expressions of several matrix-degrading enzymes and anabolic factors were examined by using quantitative PCR. Results: The expression of HDAC4 was observed in the OA cartilage, whereas it was barely detected in the normal cartilage. The extent of HDAC4 expression had a statistically negative correlation with OA severity. We further explored that the reduction of HDAC4 level led to a significant repression of proinflammation cytokines induced up-regulated expressions of matrix-degrading enzymes (MMP1 (Matrix metalloproteinase 1), MMP3 (Matrix metalloproteinase 3) , MMP13 (Matrix metalloproteinase 13), ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase 1) and ADAMTS5 (aggrecanase 2)) in SW1353 in vitro. Moreover, knockdown of HDAC4 inhibited the expression of some anabolic genes (such as aggrecan). Conclusions: In this study, our findings suggest that the abnormal expression of HDAC4 in osteoarthritic cartilage might be implicated in promoting catabolic activity of chondrocyte, which is associated with OA pathogenesis. Thus, our findings give a new insight into the mechanism of articular cartilage damage, and indicate that HDAC4 might be a potential target for the therapeutic interventions of OA.
