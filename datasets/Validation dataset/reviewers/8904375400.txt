8744275216	New assessment method for reliability of prediction model with fuzzy mathematics	The distribution of the authentic forecast results can embody the fiduciary level of the prediction model. The probability of the authentic forecast results obtained by the prediction model was defined as the fiduciary level of prediction model. A new method for assessment of the fiduciary level of prediction model was proposed. In order to assess the fiduciary level of the forecast results, a membership function for describing the relationship between the fiduciary level and absolute value of relative error of forecast results was established on the theory of fuzzy mathematics. By using the fuzzy mathematics and reliability theory, the formula to calculate the fiduciary level of the prediction model was provided. A prediction model for waxy oil viscosity was taken as an example to prove the applicability of the assessment method. The results show that the fiduciary levels of prediction model are different for the same oil sample with the different membership function or for the different oil sample with the same membership function.

17144439104	Viscoelasticity of waxy crudes near gel point	Small-amplitude oscillatory shear tests on Daqing and Shengli crude oils were carried out at the temperature range near the gel points of oil using a stress-controlled rheometer. Both waxy crude oils had obvious viscoelastic properties at 4°C above their gel points. The loss angles were 37.66° and 76.55° for Daqing crude and Shengli crude, respectively. At the same relative temperature, Daqing crude exhibited more distinctive elastic properties than Shengli crude. The different contents of resin and asphaltene and properties of wax crystallization were responsible for the difference of viscoelastic characteristics between the two types of crude oils. The strength of wax crystal structure and its variation with temperature were quite different for different oils at a temperature near the crude gel point. Thus, it was important that rheological characteristics and the temperature dependence of crude in the critical temperature range near the gel point should be considered in determining the lowest operation temperature in a hot oil pipeline. The current practice of only using the gel point or pour point as the sole basis is improper.

22244490999	Temperature drop calculation of waxy crude in a buried pipeline after shutdown using enthalpy formulation	After the shutdown of a buried waxy crude pipeline, wax crystals will start to precipitate when the crude cools to the temperature below the wax appearance temperature (WAT). With the quantity of wax crystal increasing, an interlocking gel-like structure forms at the wall of pipeline and gradually causes the entire mass of waxy crude to gel. According to the characteristics of wax precipitation and latent heat release during cooling down, a new approach was presented to illustrate the temperature drop along with gelling of hot waxy crude at the temperature below WAT using enthalpy formulation. The approach to calculate the enthalpy formulation by finite element method was discussed. Compared with the measured values using a pipeline of 426 mm in dia and 6 mm in wall thickness, the calculated result showed that the maximum deviation between the calculated soil temperature and the measured was < 1.4°C, and the error between the calculated average temperature inside pipe and the measured was 0.3°C. The accurate temperature drop could be obtained using enthalpy formulation.

24744452828	Study on thixotropy of waxy crude based on viscoelasticity analysis	Thixotropy is an important rheological property of waxy crude. The safety analysis of oil pipeline operation needs an accurate and qualitative description of the thixotropic behavior. From the new aspect of viscoelasticity analysis, the mechanical response of thixotropic waxy crude is achieved by means of elastic and viscous stress analysis. A new thixotropic model was put forward based on several reasonable hypotheses, and its physical significance is explicit. The model can be used to obtain the pressure for restarting the pipeline after a period of shutdown. The thixotropy experiments were conducted for Daqing waxy crude and pour point depressant (PPD)-beneficiated Zhongyuan crude. Using this model, the experimental data were regressed by nonlinear least square method. The regression result indicates that the new model can predict the thixotropic behavior accurately. Compared with other models, the new model has the advantages of minor parameters and high accuracy.

24944578393	Prediction of viscosity variation for waxy crude oils beneficiated by pour point depressants during pipelining	Pour-point-depressant (PPD) beneficiation is an emerging technology for facilitating pipelining of waxy crude oils. However, it was found both in lab studies and field tests that the viscosities of PPD-beneficiated waxy crude oils may increase as a result of pump shear or pipe flow shear during pipelining, called the shear effect. Current method for understanding this viscosity variation is to measure the viscosities by experimental simulation, which is quite time- and effort-consuming for long-distance pipelines. A new method for predicting the viscosity variation during pipelining is presented in this article based on a mathematical model for predicting viscosity of PPD-beneficiated waxy crude oils at certain temperature after shear and a model for predicting non-Newtonian viscosity of waxy crude oils as a function of temperature and precipitated wax. As verification, viscosity variations of five PPD-beneficiated waxy crude oils during pipelining are predicted by using the presented method and compared with the measured data from experimental simulations. The predicted viscosities are in good agreement with the measured data, with an average absolute deviation of 14.1% for all 52 data points. Comparisons between the measured or predicted viscosities during pipelining and viscosities obtained from the fast cooling experiment of PPD effectiveness evaluation demonstrate that the evaluation of PPD effectiveness for practical application should take the shear effect into consideration. The presented method provides a new way to evaluate the PPD's effectiveness in pipelining application quickly and effectively. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Inc.

28144434194	Correlations between the pour point/gel point and the amount of precipitated wax for waxy crudes	The amount of precipitated wax is one of the key factors that governs the flow properties of waxy crudes. Experimental results of 24 crudes have shown that approximately 2 wt% precipitated wax is sufficient to cause a virgin waxy crude gelling. Accordingly, a correlation between the pour point and the temperature at which 2 wt% of wax has precipitated out from a crude oil; i.e., T c (2 wt%), and a correlation between the gel point and T c (2 wt%) have been developed. The proposed correlation of the pour point is in accordance with the correlation developed by Letoffe et al. (1995) on the basis of 14 crudes from eight countries. The development of the gel point correlation and further verification of the pour point correlation indicate that there is a relationship between the gelling of virgin waxy crudes and the amount of precipitated wax. According to these correlations and the amount of precipitated wax, which can be determined only with a little sample by thermodynamic models or Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiment, the gel point and pour point of virgin waxy crude can be predicted even if the oil sample is very limited. Heat treatment and chemical treatment can greatly improve flow behavior of waxy crudes, and more precipitated wax is present when the beneficiated (thermally beneficiated or PPD-beneficiated) crude oils gel. Experimental results showed that approximately two or three times the amount of precipitated wax presents at the gelling temperature when the oils were in their beneficiated (thermally beneficiated or PPD-beneficiated) conditions.

29144526076	An experimental study on viscoelasticity of Daqing crude oil	The gelation extent and structure strength can be revealed by the viscoelastic parameters and gelation temperature measured by small amplitude oscillatory shear experiment. A series of oscillatory shear experiments were conducted to measure the viscoelastic parameters of Daqing crude oil with a stress-controlled rheometer RSH150. The results showed that the storage modulus and loss modulus increased in an exponential fashion as the test temperature was reduced. There existed a worst heating temperature for the rheological behavior. The strength of waxy structure and gelation temperature decreased when increasing cooling rate. At the same shear temperature, the strength of waxy structure decreased rapidly and finally tended to a steady state as the energy dissipation of viscous flow increased. Under the same energy dissipation of viscous flow, when the shear temperature was close to the measuring temperature, the low storage modulus, loss modulus and gelation temperature would emerge. When the shear temperature was close to or higher than abnormal point, the viscoelastic parameters varied little with the shear temperature. The recovery of sheared waxy structure displayed an irreversible property.

29244444523	Numerical simulation of the temperature field in the soil around a buried hot oil pipeline after shutdown	The mathematical model of the temperature field in the soil around the pipeline is established in order to accurately simulate the temperature field. In the model, the thermal influence zone in the soil around the pipeline is simplified as a rectangle and it is divided into two parts. The first part is the dried annular region outside the pipeline whose thickness is 0.5 m. A finite element program is developed for solving this mathematical model. The calculation result of a case shows that, when the outside diameter of the pipeline is 426 mm, the temperature of the oil in the pipeline is 65.0°C and the natural temperature of the soil at the depth of the pipeline axis is 9.0°C, the horizontal edges of the thermal influence zone are about 13.0 m from the pipeline axis , and the drop of soil temperature only occurs in the region of 1.1 m from the pipeline axis within 40 h after pipeline shutdown, which provides a reliable basis for the evaluation of the safety of the restart of buried waxy crude pipelines after shutdown.

2942741281	Mathematical model for shear effect of gel point of crude beneficiated with pour-point depressants	Shear is one of the major factors influencing flow properties of waxy crude beneficiated with the pour-point depressants (PPD). The data obtained from pipelines in operation and laboratory experiments reveal that there exists a good relationship between the gel-point increment due to shear and the gel-point reduction of the non-sheared beneficiated crude, which is defined as the gel-point difference between the virgin crude and the crude beneficiated with PPD before shear. On the basis of the general rules of shear effect, a mathematical model for correlating the gel-point of the sheared-PPD-beneficiated crude oil and the entropy generation due to viscous flow in the shear process and being applicable to other crude oils was developed. By using this model, the gel point of the PPD-beneficiated crude oil sheared at any entropy generation can be predicted, provided that the gel points of the virgin crude and the PPD-beneficiated crude before shear are known. Among a total of 294 data of gel points obtained from the PPD-beneficiated Daqing crude, PPD-beneficiated Xinjiang blended crude and PPD-beneficiated Zhongyuan crude, compared with predicted values, one half has a deviation within 1°C, and 86.8 percent of the data has a deviation within 2°C. The average absolute deviation of gel points predicted by the presented model is 1.12°C. This model provides a basis for numerical simulation of flow behaviors of PPD-beneficiated crude in pipeline transportation.

Firstly, the types of surfactants are identified by methylene blue chloride-chloroform test method and the elemental analysis such as Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, S and N. Then, the different surfactants and low molecular components are separated by adsorption chromatography after parts of low molecular components are dried in an oven, and the molecular weight distribution is measured by gel permeation chromatography also.

Residual stress existed near a weld seam, and the closer the distance from a weld seam was, the higher the residual stress. The first principal stresses of residual stresses on welding repair of the drilled pipeline were mostly tensile. The highest residual stress in tensile was ∼ 70.94% of the yield limit of pipe material. The second principal stresses of residual stresses near a spiral weld seam were compressive. The highest residual stress in compression was about 74.66% of the yield limit of pipe material. The high residual stress occurred at the bottom of a tube welded on pipelines.

33748692045	Study on yielding behavior of the waxy crude of Daqing Oilfield near condensation point	The shut-off of the long distance pipeline for waxy crude oil often occurs. The gelling and yielding behaviors of waxy crude oil near condensation point temperature are the very important bases for evaluating the safety of the pipeline when the long distance pipeline shuts up. The yielding behavior of the waxy crude oil of Daqing Oilfield near condensation point is studied by simulation experiments. It is shown that there is a flex point on the relation curve between yield stress and end-cooling temperature, the flex point is 2 °C above gel temperature; when the end-cooling temperature is constant, there is a exponential relation between yield stress and measuring temperature. The empirical relational expressions between yield stress and end-cooling temperature and measuring temperature are established by the comprehensive analysis of the experimental data. This research provides basic data for the hydraulic calculation of Tieda pipeline in the restarting process after shut-off.

33748457106	Study on wax deposition of Daqing crude oil	A wax deposition model of Daqing crude oil was developed on the basis of theoretical analysis and laboratory experiment. The effects of oil temperature, flow velocity and temperature gradient of pipeline wall on wax deposition of Daqing oil were studied. When the temperature difference between crude oil and wall of pipeline is same, the wax deposition rate is different. There is wax deposition peak along a pipeline. At the same temperature of pipeline wall, the wax deposition rate increases with increase of oil temperature. At the same oil and wall temperature, the wax deposition rate increases with increase of flow velocity. The wax deposition model was used to predict wax deposition profile along Tieling-Qinhuangdao pipeline at different seasons. The results show that there is an area where wax deposition rate is serious between pump stations in winter. In autumn and spring, the wax deposition rate is the highest in outlets of pump stations. In summer, the variation of wax deposition rate is little along the Ticling-Qinhuangdao pipeline.

One group of blends might have contained the same components as another group, but the fractions of each component are different. Four indexes described the deviation of the predicted viscosity from the measured viscosity: viscosity deviation (VD), absolute average deviation (AAD), maximum deviation (MAX) and profile of deviation (DP). The main observation is that comprehensive evaluation of the 14 models considered requires combining the AAD, MAX and DP indexes.

33845991548	Flow behavior of Daqing waxy crude oil under simulated pipelining conditions	Daqing oilfield is the largest oilfield in China. This crude oil is a typical waxy crude oil, with a wax content of 26% and a gel point of 32 °C. Flow behaviors of waxy crude oils at temperatures near the gel point/pour point are vital for both pipeline hydraulic calculation and evaluation on restartability of a shutdown pipeline. In this study, experimental simulation was conducted by using a stirred vessel with the energy dissipation of viscous flow as the shear simulation parameter. Crude oil specimens were taken from the stirred vessel at different temperatures during flow simulation, and the DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) curves and rheological properties, such as viscosity, gel point, yield stress, and thixotropy, were measured. The viscosity under simulated pipelining conditions was found to be much less than that measured under quiescent cooling conditions, and the gel point decreased with decreasing temperature of sampling, i.e., the end temperature of the dynamic cooling process. The DSC curves of crude oil specimen captured at different sampling temperatures and from different positions such as the bulk of crude oil and the wall of the stirred vessel showed no difference, which indicated the depletion of wax due to wax deposition during the shear simulation was not responsible for viscosity and gel point reduction in the dynamic cooling measurement. Therefore, this reduction is attributed to shear disturbance on the developing wax crystal structure, called the shear history effect. At sampling temperatures above 35 °C, which is 3 °C above the gel point measured under quiescent cooling conditions, both the yield stresses and the thixotropic parameters showed little dependence on the shear history. However, at lower sampling temperatures, remarkable shear history dependence was found. Empirical correlations were developed between the yield stress and the sampling temperature as well as the measurement temperature and between the thixotropic parameters and the sampling temperature. These correlations provide not only quantitative information on the shear history effect of waxy crude but also accurate rheological properties for assessment of the operation state and restartability of pipelines transporting this crude oil. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33846043129	Direct image-based fractal characterization of morphologies and structures of wax crystals in waxy crude oils	The morphology and structure of wax crystals are among the factors dominating rheological characteristics of a waxy crude oil at temperatures below the wax appearance temperature (WAT). In several reported researches fractal dimensions were employed in describing the waxy crude oil microstructures; however, they were all determined via the indirect approach, i.e.deduced from the rheological data. This paper presents a direct fractal characterization approach based on micrographs of wax crystals. The box-counting method is applied to the wax crystal images of three waxy crude oils beneficiated with and without pour-point-depressants (PPDs), and for the fractal measurements the t-distribution tests of hypothesis on linear regression are performed at the significance level of 0.01. It is demonstrated that the boundary fractal dimensions from micrographs of different visual fields of a specimen are almost identical, with the maximum and minimum relative ranges being 9.97% and 1.88% respectively, and with the standard deviation ranging from 0.0549 to 0.0107. Then the wax crystal structures are determined as fractal at the confidence level of 99%. All the listed absolute t-statistics with the minimum of 29.568 are much higher than the corresponding t-quantiles with the maximum of 3.4995. The results also show that the larger value of the boundary box dimension represents the higher complexity and irregularity of the wax crystal morphology. The box dimension increases with decreasing oil temperature for each waxy crude oil. After the oil is beneficiated with a PPD, the box dimension increases at each given temperature. Thus, it is feasible to use fractal dimensions to characterize the waxy crude oil microstructures. This helps to probe the rheology-microstructure relation. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

33846550716	Effect law of shear on the visco-elasticity of waxy crude	In order to investigate the effect of shear on rheological property of waxy crude, the viscoelastic parameters (energy storage modulus and energy consumption modulus) of Daqing crude oil which undergoes different shear actions and the same cooling history are measured using a stress-controlled rheometer with high precision. The shear action is characterized by viscous flowing energy dissipation. The variation laws of the viscoelastic parameters with shear action are obtained, and the corresponding relational equations are established. The variation laws of the viscoelastic parameters with shear action and holding time are observed. It is found that in the stable varying stage of the viscoelastic parameters with holding time, there is a difference of the viscoelastic parameters between in dynamic and static cooling, so the data of the viscoelastic parameters measured under static cooling cannot be used for the technological calculation of oil transportation pipeline; the change of shear action has a little influence on the rheological property of the waxy crude, and this discovery can be used as a guidance for the assessment of the rheological property of waxy crude during the periods of pipeline operation and shut-down.

A series of oscillatory shear experiments were performed to test the viscoelastic parameters of Daqing crude oil with a controlled-stress rheometer RSH150. The results indicate that the storage modulus and loss modulus increase in an exponential fashion with decreasing testing temperature. There exists a worst heating temperature for the rheological behavior. The strength of waxy structure and gelation temperature increase as the cooling rate is reduced. The shear action is characterized by energy dissipation due to viscous flow. At the same shear temperature, the strength of waxy structure decreases rapidly and finally attains a stable state as the energy dissipation due to viscous flow is increased. Keeping the same energy dissipation due to viscous flow, the closer the shear temperature is to the test temperature, the lower storage modulus, loss modulus, and gelation temperature would emerge. When being close to or higher than the abnormal point, the shear temperature has few influences on the viscoelasticity.

34548281768	Waxy crude shutdown method yields savings	A proper identification of the uncertain duration of an accidental shutdown will be helpful in saving fuel and ensure effective response to accidents during pipeline operation. Efficiencies for determining the maximum shutdown time (MST) can save on heating costs and will be accurate and flexible. The connection between the required time and the available time to confront accidents can determine the success with which pipeline accidents are dealt with. The time required to deal with an accident will rely on location, type and MST can represent the available time for dealing with the accident. A pipeline's MST is then derived from information such as shutdown times, accident type, cause position and the determination of the distribution of actual shutdown times. In addition, the objective reliability from the pipeline operator is determined as well as a simulation of the distribution of the actual shutdown times. MST's length will affect transportation cost and the efficiency with which accidents can be solved. In calculating MST, there is a need to gather actual accident shutdown data and accident response reliability index of the pipeline.

34547974729	Experimental research on characteristic temperature of waxy crude	The variation of viscosity with temperature was measured by temperature scanning procedures in a coaxial cylinder viscometer. The waxy crude tended to become gel at low temperature. On the basis of gelation theory, the test data was treated by conventional method, and the characteristic temperature of waxy crude was found. The characteristic temperature was corresponding to the maximum value of gelling activity energy. The flow ability of waxy oil at low temperature get weaker as the characteristic temperature gets higher for the same oil. The characteristic temperature and entropy generation of waxy crude generated during pipeline transportation have the power correlation. The empirical relational expression of characteristic temperature versus entropy generation was developed on the basis of test data. Using this relational expression, the characteristic temperature of crude oil can be predicted, provided that the entropy generation is known. 92 groups of data of characteristic temperature obtained from six virgin crude oils and four PPD-beneficiated crude oils were compared with the predicted values. The maximum absolute deviation of characteristic temperature is 0.86°C, and the average absolute deviation of characteristic temperature is 0.3°C.

The study used 654 sets of viscosity data of 70 crude blends to verify these ten published models, with 14 crude oil samples from Xinjiang were involved. Among the ten models, the modified Cragoe model agreed best with the experimental data, which needs the input of the viscosity of every binary blend at a mixing ratio of 1:1. Its absolute average relative deviation is 7.7%. Furthermore, based on these data and the reported models, three new empirical models were developed. The new ones are available without the viscosity of every binary blend at a mixing ratio of 1:1. Their predicting data agree well with the experimental data when the absolute average relative deviations from 12% to 17%. © 2007 Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer.

34748843330	Experimental simulation of effect of shear on rheological properties of beneficiated waxy crude oils	Flow properties such as viscosity and gel point of waxy crude oils, particularly the beneficiated waxy crude oils, are sensitive to shear history that the crude oil experienced, called the shear history effect. To understand quantitatively this shear history effect is necessary to oil pipeline design and operation. For experimental simulation of the shear process during pipelining, shear rates of turbulent pipe flow, and flow through centrifugal pumps and throttle valves are necessary. Stirred vessels are usually used for shear simulation in laboratory, therefore, shear rate in the stirred vessels has to be known before shear simulation. Based on relationship between energy dissipation rate and the shear rate, approaches are developed and presented for calculation of shear rates in the above-mentioned specific flows. Combined with the entropy generation due to viscous flow in the shear process, which has been proved to be a proper parameter for simulation of the shear history effect, the shear history effect on viscosity and gel point of the beneficiated waxy crude oils has been experimentally simulated accurately. © 2007 Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer.

34748847975	Viscoelasticity of gelled waxy crude oil	When the temperature of waxy crude oil is below the wax precipitation temperature, wax will precipitate out from oil solution. On further cooling, more and more wax crystals separate out and interlock to form a network that entraps liquid oil into its structure, resulting in gelation of the crude oil. The gelation extent and strength can be expressed with viscoelastic parameters. A controlled-stress rheometer RS150H was used to measure the viscoelastic parameters of Daqing crude under different history conditions by oscillatory shear experiment. The results indicate that the storage modulus and loss modulus increase in an exponential relation as the measuremental temperature is decreased. There exists a worst heating temperature for the rheological behavior. The strength of wax crystal structure and gelation temperature increase with decreasing cooling rate. Under the same shear temperature, the strength of wax crystal structure decreases rapidly and finally tends to a steady state as the energy dissipation due to viscous flow is decreased. Under the same energy dissipation due to viscous flow, the closer the shear temperature is to the measuring temperature, the lower the storage modulus, loss modulus and gelation temperature will emerge. When the shear temperature is close to or higher than abnormal point, the viscoelastic parameters vary little.

34748849199	Low-temperature flowability characteristic of waxy crude	Viscosity variation with temperature was measured by temperature scanning procedures in a coaxial cylinder viscometer. An eigen-temperature is found in viscosity-temperature chart generated from the temperature sweep experiment. It is the temperature corresponding to the maximum value of the curvature of a non-dimensional viscosity-temperature chart. The experimental results show that the eigen-temperature varies linearly with shear rate and cooling rate. Eigen-temperatures decrease either with decreasing the shear rate or with increasing the cooling rate. The eigen-temperatures of PPD-beneficiated crudes are more sensitive to the shear and cooling rate than those of virgin crudes. The eigen-temperature of virgin crude is almost equal to its pour point, while the eigen-temperature of PPD-beneficiated crude is much lower than its pour point. This indicates that the eigen-temperature may be applied to assess the flowability of waxy crudes with various shear and thermal histories, and may also provide a new means to evaluate the effect of PPD on the low-temperature flowability of waxy crude. © 2007 Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer.

34748855472	Pipelining characteristics of Daqing waxy crude oil	Compared with pipelining Newtonian fluid, the pipelining characteristics of the waxy crude pipeline are sensitive to the complicated rheological properties. When the temperature is lower than the wax appearance temperature(WAT), the waxy crude oil has complicated non-Newtonian flow characteristics that are related to shear and thermal history. Because of these complicated parameters, it is very difficult to study the pipelining characteristics of the waxy crude pipeline. The rheological parameters near the gel point were measured accurately on the basis of quantitatively simulation of the Daqing oil pipelining. A program was developed to predict critical condition of the pipeline unsteady operation condition.

34748890440	Gelling properties of waxy crude under quiescent and shearing conditions	Gel point or pour point is the temperature indicating the gelling of waxy crude, and is widely used for evaluating the low temperature flowability of a crude oil. While they are not sufficient to describe the gelling properties of waxy crudes under flow conditions, since the rheological properties of waxy crudes are strongly dependent on shear history. The gelling characteristics of waxy crude were investigated by dynamic temperature sweep measurements. At a given dynamic stress, the gelation temperature at which the storage modulus equals the loss modulus almost coincides with the eigen-temperature, the temperature corresponding to the maximum value of the curvature of a non-dimensional viscosity-temperature chart. For the rather low stress, the wax crystal network formation will not be disturbed, and the crude is gelled as under the quiescent conditions, both gelation temperature and eigen-temperature are close to the gel point of the specimen. However, they decrease with the increasing shear stress. This suggests that these two parameters may be appropriate measures of the onset of gelling under static as well as flow conditions. © 2007 Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer.

The unstructured-finite-volume method was used to investigate the complex flow and heat transfer state in the products pipeline and hot crude pipeline laying in one ditch by numerical simulation. The hydraulic and thermal calculations of single crude pipeline and two pipelines for products and crude oil under the same condition were carried out. The result shows that the temperature of crude oil in the pipeline is almost unaffected by the products pipeline, when the interval between two pipelines was 1.2 meters.

37749000947	Safety assessment benchmarks of shutdown and restart for crude oil pipeline	The characteristics of restart pressure used in the crude oil pipeline shutdown and restart safety assessment were analyzed. It is pointed out that the maximum allowable incident pressure(MAIP), but not the maximum allowable operation pressure(MAOP), was more suitable for the safety assessment benchmarks of pipeline shutdown and restart. Referencing the MAIP and basing on the pressure parameters provided in Chinese standards, 1.1 times pipeline internal design pressure, 1.1 times pipe remaining strength and 1.1 MAOP were respectively recommended as the safety assessment benchmarks for pipelines with no defects, detected defects and undetected defects. The results obtained in a case of a pipeline with undetected defects show that 1.1 MAOP is more reasonable than MAOP as the safety assessment benchmarks of shutdown and restart for crude oil pipeline.

77954637474	The variation of the gel point of daqing crude oil with pipelining history	Daqing crude oil is a typical waxy crude oil with a wax content of 26.6 wt% and a gel point of 32°C. In order to conduct the safety analysis of pipeline operation, the variation of gel point of Daqing crude oil with thermal and shear history was studied through pipelining simulation experiments. The experiments were performed under different annual throughputs and shear rates of pipeline flow. The results suggest that the change of shear action has little effect on the gel point of crude oil. As the final dynamic cooling temperature is increased, the change of gel point experiences two stages, staying constant at first and then decreasing. Through 13 groups of pipelining simulation experiments, the effects of heating temperature ranging from 45°C to 65°C on gel point of Daqing crude oil were studied. It has been indicated that the gel point increases as the heating temperature is increased under the same final dynamic cooling temperature. The relation equation was constructed to be used to predict the gel point under certain heating temperatures and final dynamic cooling temperature. The average absolute deviation of 52 predicted values of gel point is 0.58°C. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

84876592611	Comparison study on linear interpolation and cubic B-spline interpolation proper orthogonal decomposition methods	In general, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is used to deal with single-parameter problems in engineering practice, and the linear interpolation is employed to establish the reduced model. Recently, this method is extended to solve the double-parameter problems with the amplitudes being achieved by cubic B-spline interpolation. In this paper, the accuracy of reduced models, which are established with linear interpolation and cubic B-spline interpolation, respectively, is verified via two typical examples. Both results of the two methods are satisfying, and the results of cubic B-spline interpolation are more accurate than those of linear interpolation. The results are meaningful for guiding the application of the POD interpolation to complex multiparameter problems. © 2013 Xiaolong Wang et al.

45749120858	Economic comparison between different heating schemes of batch pipelining of cold and hot crude oils	Cold and hot oils transported alternately in pipelines is a new technology in crude oil transportation, and the appropriate heating scheme to choose is one of the critical technologies. A model, based on the couple of unsteady thermodynamic and hydraulic characteristics to calculate the parameters of batch transportation of cold and hot oils is set up and solved with the finite volume method and the method of thermodynamic characteristic together. The software is developed and verified with the field data gained from one crude oil pipeline in China. Feasibilities of different heating schemes are analyzed by simulating the inlet temperature changing with time. Two different heating-control patterns, heating the low-freezing crude oil entirely or partly, are put forward. Regular variations of minimum heating consumption under two heating-control patterns are studied, and the minimum heating consumption under one heating-control pattern is compared with that under the other. The results show that the minimum consumption of heating oil in the partly heating low-freezing oil is less than that in the entirely heating low-freezing oil.

Based on the model, the effect of soil temperature surrounding pipeline, oil temperature, pipe diameter, buried depth of pipe, and heat conductivity coefficient of soil on the thermal influence distance in the horizontal direction of pipeline was analyzed quantitatively. The horizontal thermal influence distances of buried pipelines with the diameters of 426 and 720 mm at 22°C, 15°C, and 8°C were determined respectively. Compared with other factors, the pipe buried depth variation in the commonly adopted range from 1.2 to 1.8 m led to little difference in the horizontal thermal influence distance. The calculated results agreed well with the field-measured data. The rationality of the model was verified.

The main factors affecting the wax deposition were selected by using F testing method. The affecting factors include the viscosity of crude oil, shear stress on tube wall, temperature gradient and the dissolved fraction of wax mass on tube wall. The unified wax deposition model was presented by using line correlation method and wax deposition data of 9 kinds of crude oils on flow loop. In the application of this model, the wax deposition experiment on the flow loop was not needed. The wax deposition could be predicted by using viscosity, wax precipitation property and density of crude oil. The wax deposition along the Zhongning-Yinchuan pipeline was predicted by using this unified wax deposition model, instead of the wax deposited experiments on flow loop. The prediction result was compared with the field data. The relative average error is 6.32%. The maximum relative error is 20%. This method can be used to determine the period of pigging.

Its combustion flow was described with RNG turbulence model, eddy dissipation turbulent combustion model and discrete droplet model for liquid. The flow in the rotation combustor was simulated at three working speeds, 0 r/min, 1000 r/ min and 2000 r/min. The distribution of gas velocity, static pressure, particle motion trajectory, and monopropellant mass fraction were computed and compared. The results show that the static pressure increases with the increasing of the rotating speed and the center of the reversed flow region goes forward while the dimension of the reversed flow region becomes smaller. The gas flow and particle trajectory generates helical movement. The mass fraction distribution of monopropellant in rotation combustor is nearer its head than that in stationary combustor. It is proven that the rotation makes the fuel combustion fast and improves combustion efficiency. It is suggested that rotation is helpful to shorten the axial length of combustor.

52349122896	Yielding characteristics of gelled Daqing crude oil on different stress loading time	In order to acquire the relationship between the yielding of gelled Daqing crude oil and stress loading time, the control stress rheometer (Haake RS-150) was used, with the shear stress loading in three different ways: constant, ramp and stepwise sequence. The results show that the yielding of gelled Daqing crude oil closely depends on the loading time of shear stress. The yielding is the result of the accumulation of deformation with time. The yield stress of gelled crude oil decreases with the increase of time duration of shear stress at each level, but the time needed for yielding is prolonged. The values of shear stress and time duration complement each other, and either the low shear stress with long time duration or the high shear stress with short time duration can lead to the yielding of gelled crude oil in a range. For the shear stress loading in a stepwise way, the yield stress decreases exponentially with the increase of time duration in each step, and the yielding time increases linearly with the time duration increasing in each step in log-log scale coordinates.

A simplified way to determine the parameters in the model was proposed according to the rules and mechanism of shear effectiveness. In this way, after the viscosity or apparent viscosity of virgin crude, corresponding unsheared PPD-beneficiated crude and the sheared PPD-beneficiated crude at a certain temperature are determined, and the parameters in the model can be calculated. The mathematical model can be used to predict the viscosity or apparent viscosity at this temperature of the PPD-beneficiated crude sheared at other temperatures and at various entropy generations. This model combined with a viscosity-temperature model of waxy crude can also be used to predict the viscosities of the sheared PPD-beneficiated crude at other temperature. It is verified that the experimental data of PPD-beneficiated Zhongyuan crude and Lunnan-Qiuling crude blend are in good agreement with predicted results.

56549103963	Optimal heating ratio of batch pipelining of cold and hot crude oils	Cold oils (not heated oils) and hot oils (heated oils) transported alternately in pipelines is a new technology in the transportation of crude oils. Choosing an economical heating scheme is one of the crucial technologies in the engineering application. An unsteady hydraulic and thermodynamic model describing the heat and fluid flow characteristics of the batch transportation of cold and hot oils was proposed. The governing equations were solved by the combination of a finite volume method and a thermodynamic characteristic method. A code based on the model was developed and verified by the experimental data obtained from a real oil pipeline in China. An optimization model was proposed based on the minimum heating consumption. Numerical calculations were carried out under different heating ratios. The heating consumptions of the low-pour-point oil tail were calculated under different heating ratios. Economical comparison shows there is an optimal heating ratio for the low-pour-point oil to attain a minimum heating consumption.

61349184562	Study on thixotropy of waxy crude oil emulsion	The thixotropy of waxy crude oil is an important basic parameter for the restart pressure calculation and pumpability assessment of a pipeline. The thixotropy of waxy crude oil emulsion must be studied to learn the restart process of an offshore oil-water mixed transmission pipeline. In this paper, the thixotropy of waxy crude oil emulsion is studied based on the research of the thixotropy of dehydrated waxy crude oil, and it is found that the intendency of the thixotropy of waxy crude oil emulsion is similar to that of the crude oil. A mathematical model is established, describing the thixotropic behaviors that shear stress of waxy crude oil emulsion decreases under constant share rate. Using this model, experimental data regression is conducted by least square method. The regression results indicate that this model is adapted to not only waxy crude oil emulsion but also dehydrated waxy oil and PPD-beneficiated waxy oil. Compared with other models, the new model has less parameters and is convenient for computation.

Daqing gelled crude oil, northern Xinjiang crude oil and Tuha crude oil, are studied by using rheometer RS150 in controlled stress mode, with the stress loading in stepwise sequence and in a ramp-up way. It is found that the yield time of gelled waxy crude oil increases monotonically with the decrease of stress loading rate, the data regression analysis shows that the relationship between these two parameters follows a power law function. Based on the result, an expression that can describe the relationship between the stress loading rate and yield time of gelled waxy crude oil is developed, and the physical meaning of this expression is analyzed with dimensional analysis. The universalization of this expression is verified by fitting with different experimental data of gelled waxy crude oil from domestic and foreign literatures.

For two kinds of crude oils transported in batches, three heating schemes are proposed and the economy and safety are evaluated. The simulation results show that the heating scheme, in which only a small portion of the low-pour-point crude oil just traveling before the high-pour-point crude oil is heated and all the high-pour-point crude oil is heated to a uniform temperature, costs the smallest heating energy. © 2009, Institut français du pétrole.

70350003823	Transportation of waxy crudes in batch through china west crude oil pipeline with pour-point-depressant beneficiation	The West Crude Oil Pipeline, 1500km long, a newly constructed pipeline, was put into operation in August 2007. Several crudes with different wax content and thus different pour point/gel point are pumped through the pipeline in batch, with the gel point ranging from -10°C to 10°C. In winter, the lowest ground temperature will be as low as 2°C at the depth where the pipeline is buried. The pour-point-depressant (PPD) was used to reduce gel point of the waxy crudes to ensure safety of pipeline operation. To make sure that the selected PPD reduce gel point effectively, field tests were conducted from September to November in 2007 to prepare for winter operation. The PPD was injected to the waxy crudes at the initial station, and gel points and densities were measured at the initial station and several intermediate stations along the pipeline. The test results show that the PPD may effectively reduce the gel point of the crude, but the effectiveness depends on the composition of crude oil; the reduced gel point of the crude may recover during pipelining; reheating temperature at the intermediate stations may seriously affect the flow properties of the PPD beneficiated crude. Reheating the PPD beneficiated Tuha crude oil to the temperature range of 20 ̃ 35 °C results in poor flow properties. This indicates that the reheating temperature at the intermediate stations must be properly controlled to avoid falling into this temperature range. Based on this field test, the pipeline was safely operated for last winter. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.

74549128176	Change of yield stress of daqing crude oil with thermal and shear history	Daqing crude oil is a typical waxy crude oil with a wax content of 26.6 wt.% and a gel point of 32°C. The yield stress of waxy crude oils is an important property in the process calculation and flow safety analysis for heated oil pipeline. The Daqing crude oil was studied and the yield stress change with shear history was explored through simulation experiment of pipelining. It was found that the change of throughput variation or shear rate showed little effect on yield stress. There existed a peak yield stress on the relation curve of yield stress with final dynamic cooling temperature. The prediction model of yield stress for waxy crude oil under the condition of shutdown was developed and can be used to predict the yield stress of Daqing crude oil at certain heating temperature, final dynamic cooling temperature, and measurement temperature. For the 139 groups of yield stress data of Daqing crude oil from the simulation experiment of pipelining, the result of prediction with this model showed that the average relative deviation between the yield stress measured and predicted is 30.27%, and the coefficient of correlation is 0.9623.

In the past 10 years, driven by the petroleum industry, crude oil rheology has been an active field. Studies on crude oil rheology have been passing a way from simply relying on rheological measurements, through quantitative experimental simulation of shear and thermal history effects in pipelining, to recent development of correlation between flow properties and shear and thermal history. Currently, the study is toward quantitative inquiry of relations between the rheological behaviors and micro-structures of wax crystals as well as oil compositions. Advances achieved by the author' team are summarized, including simulation of the thermal and shear history effects, correlations and computation of flow properties, fractal characterization of morphology and structure of wax crystals, relations of rheological behaviors to fractal dimension and oil compositions, and the most successful example of the application of rheology in crude oil pipelining.

77249174915	Simulation of pipelining pours point depressant beneficiated waxy crude oil through China West Crude Oil Pipeline	Flow properties of waxy crude oils, particularly the beneficiated waxy crude oils, are sensitive to shear history that the crude oil experienced, called the shear history effect. To simulate this shear history effect accurately is vital to pipeline design and operation. It has been demonstrated by our previous that the energy dissipation or entropy generation due to viscous flow in the shear process is a suitable parameter for simulating the shear history effect. In order to further verify the reliability of this approach, experimental simulations were conducted for three PPD-beneficiated waxy crude oils transported through the China West Crude Oil Pipeline, a most complicated long-distance- crude-oil-pipeline technically and operationally so far in China. The simulations were made by using a stirred vessel and with the energy dissipation of viscous flow as the shear simulation parameter. Comparison between the flow properties of crude oils obtained from field test and experimental simulations, it is found that the gel points and viscosities from experimental simulations are in good agreement with the field data. © 2008 Central South University Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

77951162673	A study on creep behavior of gelled daqing crude oil	Gelled waxy crude oils have complex rheological properties. Experimental research and mechanical analogy were performed for the creep behavior of Daqing crude oil. The experienced stages in creep process were partitioned based on the changes of strain and strain rate with the increasing loading time. When the loading stress was lower than the yield stress, there existed three stages; namely, instant elastic deformation, decelerated creep, and constant rate creep. When the applied stress was higher than the yield stress, accelerated creep occurred after the above three stages. By applying mechanical analogy, the elastic element, viscous element, plastic element, and accelerated creep element were employed to reflect the interior strain mechanism of crude oil under creep condition. A creep equation was proposed by incorporation with the analysis on the creep experiment. Based on the creep equation, nonlinear regression was conducted by using the creep experiment data of Daqing crude oil at different temperatures of 28°C, 29°C, 30°C, and 31°C, respectively. The average correlation coefficient was 0.9907. Substituting the calculated equation parameters into the creep equation, the creep behavior under other shear stresses can be predicted at the same temperatures. The average relative deviation is 8.29%. The change of strain of crude oil before yielding can be accurately described by the creep equation.

With the OMA addition amount increased, the wax crystals of crude oil became shorter and smaller with even size, and well dispersed from irregular, flake and rod-like. The content of wax crystals with the diameter of 2-5 μm increased from 8.5% to 95.6%, while the content of wax crystals with the diameter of 9-13 μm decreased from 67.5% to 0.01%. It was shown that the PPD could inhibit the formation of wax crystals network, thus the system energy decreased and the possibility of forming space net structure became less, and rheologic behavior was improved. The relation of PPD dosage added in crude oil with average diameter of wax crystals and magnitude of pour point depression could be determined by nonlinear fitting, which was in accordance with the testing results.

The data of single hysteresis loop obtained from the shear rate of one cycling and the multiple loops obtained from the shear cycling at various shear rates were fitted respectively using the least square. The average absolute deviation was taken as the statistical index to the experimental data. Eight thixotropy models were evaluated by the least-square regressions. Among eight models, five ones are developed specially for waxy crudes, and the other three ones are developed for human blood and proved to be suitable for describing the hysteresis loop. It is concluded that the most suitable model for describing the characteristics of hysteresis loop is developed from Cheng's idea on the basis of the Houska model about two kinds of structures (reversible and irreversible structures) existing in waxy oils.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate existing model's abilities to describe shear stress decay behaviors of waxy crude oils at constant shear rates. Seven models specially developed for or currently used to waxy crude oils are reviewed as well as two viscoelastic-thixotropic models for human blood. Stress decay behaviors were measured for four waxy crude oils and at various temperatures.

While the three models with viscoelastic backgrounds were not quite successful. For use of models, one may make choice by comprehensively considering a model's complexity in mathematic form and abilities to describe the rheological behaviors.

78751490999	Intermittent operations, PPD optimize low flow-rate waxy crude system	The China West Crude Pipeline runs between Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, northwest China. The pipeline entered service in summer 2007 at about half its 422,810 b/d design capacity. Transported crude included imported Kazakhstan crude, crude produced in North Xinjiang oil field, and crude produced in Tarim oil field. After considering all possible measures to solve the problems of long-term low flow rate operation, China West Crude Pipeline settled on intermittent operation combined with PPD treatment. PPD treatment would minimize the risk of oil gelation at low temperatures. Intermittent operation of the waxy crude pipeline includes three discrete parts: normal operation, shutdown, and restart. The thermal and hydraulic dynamics of an intermittently operated pipeline are more complex than a continuously operated line.

79952569637	An efficient algorithm of the proper orthogonal decomposition for the restart computation of buried heated crude pipelines	The present paper proposed an efficient algorithm employing the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for the computation of the normal operation, shutdown and restart processes of buried heated pipelines. Firstly, the finite volume algorithm and finite difference algorithm were adopted to generate fundamental samples, and then eigenfunctions of the oil and soil temperature fields after pipeline shutdown and the restart flux were obtained by means of the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm. Further, spectral coefficients under the condition of arbitrary computation parameters were calculated by interpolation and finally the relevant physical quantities were rebuilt. By using this new algorithm, pipeline restart parameters under other conditions could be obtained very efficiently and accurately only by means of numerical computations with fewer input data. Case studies demonstrated that the deviations between the POD simulation and the direct numerical computation were less than 0.05 °C for temperature and 3% for the flow rate, respectively. Therefore, the computation efficiency was improved greatly by using the POD algorithm, and the average time consumption for the computation of one-group input data was about 20 min by using the numerical algorithm, while the POD algorithm averagely took only 0.1 s or even less time.

79955400051	Relationship between waxy crude oil composition and change in the morphology and structure of wax crystals induced by pour-point-depressant beneficiation	The morphology and structure of wax crystals is one of the most important factors influencing flow properties of waxy crude oils. The pour-point depressant (PPD) improves flow properties of waxy crude oil by modifying the morphology and structure of wax crystals, and this modification, i.e., the effectiveness of PPD, is greatly affected by the oil composition. There have been some investigations into how the oil composition affects the effectiveness of PPD. However, these studies were basically qualitative. The objective of this study is to quantitatively reveal the relationship between the change induced by PPD beneficiation in the morphology and structure of wax crystals and the oil composition. PPD treatment was made on eight waxy crudes, and microscopic observations were performed on the morphology and structure of wax crystals before and after PPD beneficiation. The fractal dimension of the wax crystal microstructure, which was used to characterize the morphology and structure of wax crystals, was determined on the basis of the microscopic images of wax crystals. A total of 11 parameters of oil composition, which are thought to have influence on the effectiveness of PPD and the morphology and structure of wax crystals, were measured. Among them, 5 were determined to be the representative parameters of oil composition using the cluster analysis, i.e., the concentration of precipitated wax at the studied temperature, the average carbon number of wax, the viscosity of the liquid continuous phase at 60 °C, the wax content, and the content of resins and asphaltenes. Further, a correlation was developed using the multiple regression analysis between the fractal dimension change induced by PPD treatment and three representative parameters of oil composition, i.e., the concentration of precipitated wax at the studied temperature, the wax content, and the content of resins and asphaltenes. This helps to quantitatively understand the relationship between the oil composition and microstructure of wax crystals. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

0036699743	Approach to estimation of shear rate of Newtonian fluids flowing in turbulent pipe	On the basis of definition of the shear rate, a basic equation for describing the relationship of the shear rates among the turbulent flow, the mean flow and the fluctuant flow was derived. This equation is irrespective of rheological classification of fluid and thus applicable to both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The relationship between the turbulent shear rate and the energy dissipation rate of incompressible Newtonian fluids was analyzed. By using an approximate algorithm of turbulent energy dissipation rate available in literatures, some practical equations for estimating the shear rate of flow in turbulent pipe and the shear rate due to velocity fluctuations for incompressible Newtonian fluids are obtained. The distribution characteristics of shear rates of estimated turbulent and the shear rates resulted from velocity fluctuations agree with the known experimental results.

79956310060	Stochastic numerical simulation on oil temperature fluctuations of hot crude pipelines and sensitivity analysis to related factors	An efficient numerical algorithm, which employed the finite volume, finite difference, Monte Carlo and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, was proposed to simulate the stochastic fluctuation of oil temperatures. The effects of outlet oil temperature, flow rate, pressure, buried depth, soil temperature, soil thermal conductivity, oil viscosity and oil density on the stochastic fluctuation of oil temperatures were investigated through Sobol global sensitivity induces. The results show that the deviations of the mean oil temperatures between numerical simulations and field measurements were lower than 0.1 °C, and the standard deviations vary from 0.006 °C to 0.023 °C. When considered the following 4 factors: outlet oil temperature, throughput, soil temperature and oil viscosity, case studies on the China West crude pipeline show that the sum of first order global sensitivity achieved as 77.44% on Sipu station and 80.86% on Hexi station. Therefore, it is acceptable to consider these 4 factors when simulating the fluctuation of inlet oil temperatures.

79959626483	Numerical study on temperature field of a large floating roof oil tank	Accurate prediction of oil temperature in a large floating roof oil tank is very important for both strategic and commercial storage of crude oil.

84859634450	Thermal impact of the parallel laying of oil/gas pipelines	Thermal impact of the parallel laying of gas and oil pipelines remains unclear though that of two oil pipelines has been relatively well studied. A numerical simulation method combined by finite volume and finite difference was used to investigate the complex heat transfer in three typical parallel laying patterns between gas and oil pipelines: hot oil pipeline with cold gas pipeline; cold oil pipeline with hot gas pipeline and hot oil pipeline with hot gas pipeline. In terms of these three different parallel laying cases, the present paper analyzed characteristics of the maximum differential temperature range and thermal distribution of oil/gas temperatures at different intervals along pipelines relative to the single laying. The numerical simulation results can provide some guidelines for designs and safe operations of the parallel laying of oil/gas pipelines.

84859903660	Shear-induced change in morphology of wax crystals and flow properties of waxy crudes modified with the pour-point depressant	Flow properties of waxy crude oils treated with the pour-point depressant (PPD) are affected by shear during pipeline transportation, which is called the shear history effect. In this study, the influence of shear on both the fractal dimension characterizing the wax crystal morphology and flow properties of eight waxy crudes treated with the PPD was examined. Further, the characteristic groups of waxes, resins, and asphaltenes contained in the crudes and the PPD were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A correlation was developed, with the fractal dimension of wax crystals being the dependent variable and both the entropy generation because of viscous flow during the shear and the parameters of oil composition being independent variables; furthermore, developed were correlations with flow properties of the gel point, viscosity, and yield stress being the dependent variables and both the decrease of the fractal dimension of wax crystals after being sheared and the parameters of oil composition being independent variables. The results suggest that shear at temperatures below the wax appearance temperature (WAT) could destroy the interactions because of the weak van der Waals forces between waxes, between waxes and resins, between waxes and asphaltenes, and between waxes and the PPD. As a result, the wax aggregates are broken, and the fractal dimension of wax crystals decreases. The new surfaces of broken wax aggregates provide new wax crystallization sites, which lead wax crystals to intergrow. Intergrowing wax crystals result in the decline in effectiveness of the PPD. The decrease in the fractal dimension of wax crystals and the decline in the effectiveness of the PPD have positive correlations with the average carbon number of waxes, the concentration of precipitated wax, and the wax content; however, they have negative correlations with the contents of resins and asphaltenes. This may help in making a new probe into the rheology-microstructure relationship. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84863376466	Numerical simulation of the temperature fields in the crude oil within pipeline and in the soil around the pipeline for sequentially transporting the crude oils of different property	The temperature fields within and around the pipeline for sequentially transporting the crude oils with different property are different from those within and around the pipeline for transporting the crude oil of the same property. The study on the temperature fields is helpful to the design of the pipeline and the establishment of its running project. The mathematical model of the unsteady heat transfer within and around the pipeline is established and it is solved numerically by combining the finite volume method with the thermal characteristic line method. The temperature fields of some pipeline for sequentially transporting the crude oils are simulated. The results show that the temperature fields periodically vary due to the effects of different kinds of oil crude and different outlet temperatures. The periods at different spots are the same, but there is a delay time. The safe shutdown time of the pipeline is related to the initial time of shutdown. The reliability of the computation program is verified by the measured temperature data of some crude pipeline with different outlet temperatures in China.

84865471850	Yield behavior of waxy crude gel: Effect of isothermal structure development before prior applied stress	The rheological properties of waxy crude oil are dependent upon the shear and thermal histories. It would not be valuable to study the shear effect of waxy crude oil without consideration of the thermal conditions. Currently, researchers study the shear effect of waxy crude oil mainly with different cooling rates or shear temperatures; few studies have been reported about the influence of isothermal structure development on the shear effect. Present studies show that, even at constant temperature below the wax appearance temperature, the characteristics of the waxy crude gels undergo a change with quiescent duration, becoming harder and more stable. In this paper, a specimen of a typical waxy crude oil was held isothermally and quiescently for a time in the range of 0-60 min for structure development at temperatures close to the gelation temperature, followed by the application of constant stress in a wide range of 1-100 Pa at the same temperature. After subsequent cooling to below a temperature of 2 °C, the structure strength of waxy crude gel was examined by measurement of the static yield stress. This showed that the structure strength of waxy crude gel increased with isothermal aging, while the reversibility of the gel structure decreased. In cases of prior application of lower stresses (from 1 to 7 Pa), the situation of shorter aging time was easier to get a strain to overcome the critical strain, which represents the start of structure degradation, and hence induces a lower yield stress value after subsequent cooling. In cases where the specimen was prior loaded with higher stresses (from 10 to 100 Pa), the longer the aging time of structure development before prior stress application, the lower the yield stress tested after subsequent cooling. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

0037411438	A generalized model for predicting non-Newtonian viscosity of waxy crudes as a function of temperature and precipitated wax	Precipitated wax, shear and thermal history have pronounced effects on viscosity and rheological behavior of waxy crudes. On the basis of mechanism of waxy crude rheology, a shear-rate-dependent viscosity model has been developed by applying theory of suspension rheology. This model is characterized by its capability to predict viscosities of crude oils with various thermal and shear history and beneficiated with pour-point-depressants (PPD). Once viscosities at only two temperatures above the wax appearance temperature and apparent viscosities at one temperature in the non-Newtonian regime are known, viscosities or apparent viscosities at any temperatures above the gel point can be predicted by using the model together with the concentration of precipitated wax at that specified temperature. Verification by using 3458 viscosity data points ranging from 5 to 2900mPas from 33 virgin crudes and 14 PPD-beneficiated crudes with various thermal and shear history shows that the model predicts viscosities with an absolute average deviation of 7.43%. Furthermore parameters of rheological models such as the consistency coefficient K and the flow behavior index n of the power law model may be obtained by regressing predicted viscosity data and corresponding shear-rates. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The wax content and the amount of wax precipitation in a range of certain temperature can be determined with the thermal fingerprint of crude oil. The calculation procedure and its graphical version are presented. The key for calculating wax content in crude is to select a proper baseline of DSC spectrum and the enthalpy of wax precipitation that is related to the wax composition and distribution. It is recommended that a constant thermal value of wax precipitation for crude oils with unknown molecular structure should be 210 J/g.

84867758417	Temperature drop characteristics of crude oils after shutdown of a pipeline for a batchwise transportation system	In recent years, it has been proposed to transport different crude oils in a batchwise operation in a pipeline. In this article, thermal models of the normal operation and shutdown processes are established and advanced numerical methods are employed. Thermal characteristics during normal operation and shutdown are analyzed in detail through numerical simulation. Shutdown occasion parameters are defined to describe the unique shutdown state during a batch. Conclusions can be drawn that the temperature distribution in a batchwise operation is greatly different from that of an ordinary hot oil pipeline. The temperature drop during the shutdown process is determined by shutdown occasion parameters and shutdown duration. Even if there is the same crude oil in the pipeline, the temperature distributions at different occasions have significant differences. When the front of high-pour-point (HPP) oil attains the pipeline outlet, the shutdown hazard is the greatest, with the longest HPP oil segment in the pipeline and the fastest temperature drop rate during shutdown. The results not only provide a reference for the real operation of the pipeline, but also lay a foundation for further study of the restart process of the pipeline in batchwise transportation.

84871168290	A six-parameter thixotropic model for waxy crude oil	Thixotropy is one of the typical rheological characteristics of waxy crude at low temperatures, and a thixotropic model is essential for numerical simulation of pipeline restart. In this paper, based on the analysis of existing thixotropic models and combined with characteristics of waxy crude and related theories of suspension rheology, we proposed a viscoplastic model with six parameters to describe thixotropic behaviors of waxy crude. The capability of this model in fitting experimental data was verified using thixotropic data obtained from tests by the step gradient method of shear rate. The result shows that the fitting effect of this six-parameter model about experimental data is equivalent to that of the double-structural-parameter model with twelve parameters, much better than that of the conventional eight-parameter Houska model. Besides, compared with the two existing models, parameter values obtained from data regression with this proposed model are physically more reasonable thanks to less parameters and simpler state equations. Consequently, this six-parameter model may be more suitable for the numerical simulation of pipeline restart.

84874066869	Effect of carbon number distribution of wax on the yield stress of waxy oil gels	Wax deposition is one of the most important problems in flow assurance of petroleum pipelines. Pigs are commonly employed for the removal of wax deposit (actually a wax-oil gel consisting of liquid oil and solid wax particles) on the pipe wall. Understanding of the wax deposit strength, which may be a function of the carbon number distribution of wax, assists in preventing the pig from getting stuck in the pipeline. This study focuses on the effect of the carbon number distribution of wax on the yield stress of waxy oil gels. Waxes with different carbon number distribution were dissolved into a crude oil to prepare the model oils. The vane method was used to determine the yield stress of waxy oil gels formed under quiescent or shear conditions, in which an applied shear stress was maintained during the process of cooling and isothermal holding. The results showed that the yield stresses dramatically decrease with increase of average carbon number of wax regardless of the quiescent or shear conditions. However, the applied shear stress has little effect on the yield stress of the wax-oil gel 12.5% W1 + oil-A and no effect on the yield stresses of 12.5% W2 + oil-A and 12.5% W3 + oil-A. Under quiescent conditions, the changing rate of the yield stress with respect to the solid wax content reduces as the average carbon number of wax increases. The morphology and structure of the wax crystals were also observed using optical microscopy. Microscopic observation indicated that the average size and boundary fractal dimension of the wax crystals decrease but the aspect ratio increases with the increase of the average carbon number of wax. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84874159237	Thermal, macroscopic, and microscopic characteristics of wax deposits in field pipelines	Wax deposition is an important issue in crude oil transportation. Understanding the deposit properties assists in making a suitable schedule for removing wax deposits. However, there was little work published on the nature of wax deposits in field pipelines. This study focuses on the thermal, macroscopic, and microscopic characteristics of wax deposits obtained from the field pipelines. First, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate the thermal properties of wax deposits and crude oils. The results showed that the wax appearance temperature (WAT) and wax content of wax deposits is much higher than that of crude oils, and both of two parameters increase with the increasing radial distances. For all deposits, the precipitated wax concentration increases significantly with the decreasing temperature near the WAT, while it almost increases linearly when the temperature decreases about 25 °C below the WAT. Based on DSC results, a correlation between the solid wax content and wax content and temperature was developed. Verification experiments showed that this correlation calculates the solid wax content with the absolute deviation within ±4% and the average relative deviation of 3.8%. Second, the macroscopic structure of wax deposits was visually observed. The yield stresses were also determined using the vane method. The results showed that the loose structure of the original deposits could result in small values of yield stresses, and the yield stresses increase as the radial distances increase. Third, the optical microscopy was used to observe the microscopic characteristics of wax crystals. The average size, aspect ratio, and boundary fractal dimension of wax crystals in deposits vary in the ranges 9.1-14.3 μm

The prediction results of the yielding stress of 80 mixed crude oil samples shows that the average absolute error of the model is 1.92 Pa, and the average relative error is 50.18%. Taking into account the fact that it is difficult to accurately measure yielding stress of oil crude, especially minor yielding stress, the estimating errors of this model is acceptable.

In this work, thixotropic behaviors of four waxy crudes were studied experimentally using stepwise shearing measurements. The stepwise shearing method is proved to be a convenient method to obtain thixotropic experimental data. Seven published thixotropic models were evaluated based on these experimental data.

84879018306	Modeling the thixotropic behavior of waxy crude	Waxy crude shows viscoelastic, yielding, and thixotropic behaviors below the gelation point. In this paper, to depict those complex rheological behaviors a new thixotropic model is proposed. In the model, the total shear stress is considered to be a combination of an elastic stress and a viscous stress. The elastic stress, assumed to be structure- and strain-dependent, is described by a nonlinear damping function together with a structural parameter. The evolution of structural parameter is described by a new kinetic equation, whose breakdown term is assumed to be dependent on energy dissipation rate rather than on shear rate. The proposed model is validated respectively by the test of stepwise increases in shear rate and the hysteresis loop test for waxy crude and further validated by predicting the transient flow curve of hysteresis loop test with the model parameters obtained from the test of stepwise increases in shear rate. The results showed that the model's capability of fitting experimental data and prediction is satisfactory, and the model nicely predicts the transition from an "elastically" dominated region to a "viscous" dominated region without a discontinuity in the stress-strain curve. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84879169852	Measuring the flow behavior of oil-water mixtures with the stirring method	The traditional viscometer can not measure the viscosity of nonhomogeneous oil-water mixtures. Stirring may keep the mixture well blended and the torque exerted on impellers may reflect the equivalent viscosity of the fluid. Based on this principle, a stirring method of measuring the flow behavior of oil-water mixtures is developed, which includes selection of impeller types, calculation of the equivalent viscosity at certain stirring speed by using the shaft torque, and determination of the average shear rate by stirring speed and fluid viscosity. Results obtained by this approach from a single-phase crude oil or oil-water mixture are compared with those by concentric cylinder viscometer and test loop, respectively, a good agreement was achieved. Flow behaviors of high water-cut oil-water mixtures at different temperatures and with different water fractions were also investigated with this method, and the results showed good regularity.

84881599527	Modeling the viscoelasto-plastic behavior of waxy crude	Waxy crude oil exhibits complex rheological behavior below the pour point temperature, such as viscoelasticity, yield stress, and thixotropy, owing to the formation of a three-dimensional spongelike interlock network structure. This viscoelasto-thixotropic behavior is an important rheological behavior of waxy crude oils, determining the flow recovery and safe restart of crude oil pipelines. Up to now, the thixotropic models for waxy crude have been all viscoplastic models, without considering the viscoelastic part before the yield point. In this work, based on analyzing the variation of the elastic stress and viscous stress in the Mujumbar model, a new viscoelasto-plastic model is proposed, whose shear stress is separated into an elastic component and a viscous component. The elastic stress is the product of the shear modulus and elastic strain; the shear modulus is proportional to the structural parameter. For the elastic strain, we followed the line of Zhu and his coauthors and assumed that it may be expressed by an algebraic equation. The model is validated by stepwise shear rate tests and hysteresis loop tests on Daqing and Zhongyuan waxy crude. The results show that the model's fitting and predictive capability is satisfactory. © 2013 China University of Petroleum (Beijing) and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84886297970	A new thixotropic model for waxy crude	Waxy crude oil shows thixotropic behavior below the gelation temperature. The mostly used thixotropic model for waxy crude is the model proposed by Houska. One problem of Houska's model is that after the stepwise change in shear rate, the predicted shear stress decreases to its equilibrium value more quickly than the measured data. To address this problem, a new viscoplastic thixotropic model is proposed. The evolution of structural parameter is described by a new kinetic equation. In the kinetic equation, a new pre-factor with shear strain as variable is introduced for the buildup and breakdown terms, and the breakdown term is assumed to be dependent on energy dissipation rate rather than on shear rate. The proposed model was validated by the stepwise shear rate test and hysteresis loop test.

0041786669	New approach developed for estimating pour points of crude oil blends	Development of a viable crude transportation system that moves multiple crude oils requires knowledge of the crude blend pour points and other properties. The pour points of crude blend are generally not linearly proportional to the mixing-ratio of every individual crude. Reported approaches for estimating the pour points of crude blends require the pour points of every binary crude blend at a mixing-ratio of 1:1 or several compositional contents such as paraffin, resin, gas-benzene contents in the blends and viscosities at some temperatures. These requirements cause great difficulties in some cases when these basic data are unavailable as when, for example, no crude sample is available. An analysis on pour-point data from 26 binary crude blends has revealed a good relationship between two differences of pour point: • The difference between the measured and the linear-weighting-estimated pour points of the binary crude blends at a mixing-ratio of 1:1. • The difference between the pour points of the two individual crudes. This analysis has permitted development of a new correlation for estimating the pour points of multiple crude blends. Use of this correlation allows estimation of the pour points of multiple crude blends at any mixing-ratio by use of only the pour points of the individual crudes. Verified by experimental data of multiple crude blends from two to five individual crudes, the new approach has equivalent accuracy compared to the reported approaches and presents a new way to estimate the pour points of any multiple crude blends.

84888606021	Viscoelasto-thixotropic model for waxy crude	Waxy crude oil shows complex rheological behavior below gelation temperature, such as viscoelasticity, yield stress and thixotropy, owing to the formation of three dimensional sponge-like interlocking network structure. Traditional thixotropic models for waxy crude do not consider the viscoelastic behavior near and/or before yield point. To address this problem, a new thixotropic model with ten independent parameters was proposed. The new model consists of an equation of state and a structural kinetic equation. The total stress is composed of viscous stress and elastic stress. Elastic stress is assumed to be the product of shear modulus and shear strain, and shear modulus varies proportionally to structural parameter and a non-linear damping function. The evolution of structural parameter is described by a new kinetic equation whose breakdown term is assumed to be dependent on energy dissipation rate, to overcome the shortcoming of the kinetic equation whose breakdown term is assumed to be dependent on shear rate. The proposed model was validated by stepwise shear rate tests and hysteresis loop tests of Daqing waxy crude. The proposed model nicely described the viscoelasticity and thixotropy of waxy crude, and for the two kinds of test, the average absolute deviations (AADs) between fitted and measured values were within 2.0% and 5.0%, respectively. The model was further validated by predicting the transient flow curve of hysteresis loop test with the model parameters obtained from the stepwise shear rate measurement, and the results showed that the agreement between the predictions and measurements is acceptable, with AADs about 16%. © All Rights Reserved.

84899008100	Study on the effect of dispersed and aggregated asphaltene on wax crystallization, gelation, and flow behavior of crude oil	Asphaltene can exist in both the dispersed state and the aggregated state in crude oil. Because of the changes in crude oil composition, pressure, or temperature, the asphaltene transition from dispersed asphaltene to aggregated asphaltene will occur and then influence the wax crystallization, gelation, and flow behavior of crude oil. In this paper, the asphaltene transition was realized by mixing two different crude oils for different times. The aggregated asphaltene was characterized by the optical microscopy and centrifugation-based separation method. The effects of asphaltene transition on wax crystallization, gelation, and flow behavior of crude oil were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and rheological measurements. The results show that the aggregated asphaltene can serve as a crystal nucleus for wax molecules, promoting the wax precipitation, weakening the strength of the network of wax crystals, and delaying the gelation process of crude oil. On the other hand, the dispersed asphaltene can serve as the connecting point between wax crystals, accelerating the gelation of crude oil, and increasing the gel strength. The viscosity measurements below the wax appearance temperature show that the viscosity of crude oil increases because of the interaction between aggregated asphaltene and wax. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84899109790	Study on constant-pressure restart failure probability of waxy crude pipelines	The restart failure of a pipeline after prolonged shutdown is the major threat to safe operation of waxy crude pipelines. The traditional approach to evaluation of pipeline restart safety is mainly based on the deterministic method, without considering the effects of random fluctuations of relevant parameters. In this paper, with the uncertainties of the operation parameters, properties of the crude oil as well as the environment parameters being considered, and with deeply understanding of the failure mechanism of the pipeline restart, a limit state function for the recovery of the flow rate is proposed. By introducing the interference theorem, the limit state function is solved accurately and efficiently. Further, the effects of mean values of the random parameters such as flow rate, pipe diameter, soil temperature on the failure probability of the pipeline restart are investigated. Therefore, a probability-based quantitative description for the restart safety of waxy crude pipelines is achieved, and reliability-based methods are developed to determine the crude oil transportation temperature and safety time of pipeline shutdown.

84902175146	Study on low flow rate operating characteristics of hot waxy crude oil pipelines based on an unsteady-state calculation method	Hot crude oil pipeline operated at low flow rate might work in an unstable state, where the friction loss continuously increases with the decreasing flow rate. This will lead to harmful flow stagnation and needs proper management. In this paper, the unsteady-state thermal-hydraulic behavior of the coupled pipeline-pump system is investigated by adopting an unsteady-state numerical model instead of the traditional steady-state model. The new model considers the impacts of the heating strategies, initial operating conditions, and pump characteristics on the pipeline characteristics at low flow rate. Through obtaining the transient characteristics of the flow rate and friction loss, the stable and unstable working ranges are distinguished and critical flow rate is calculated. It is shown that the transient characteristics at low flow rate can be classified into three categories. (1) The flow rate keeps constant for the initial period and then decreases continuously while the friction loss increases monotonously. (2) The flow rate is constant while the friction loss increases firstly and then stays stable. (3) The flow rate maintains constancy while the friction loss increases firstly and then decreases to a final stable level. Besides, it can be concluded that the critical flow rate calculated by the unsteady-state method is recommended with preheating before the flow rate drop. © 2014 Pengfei Yu et al.

84901913665	Full and partial emulsification of crude oil-water systems as a function of shear intensity, water fraction, and temperature	Emulsification of crude oil and water may significantly affect the flow characteristics of the multiphase flow in gathering lines. Obviously, emulsification of a crude oil-water system is greatly affected by conditions such as shear intensity, water fraction, and temperature. However, there has been a lack of quantitative study of the emulsified water fraction of crude oil-water systems under various conditions of water fraction, temperature, and shear intensity. In this work, experiments were conducted by using a stirred vessel calibrated for the determination of mean shear rate, and the emulsified water fractions under flowing conditions were determined by extrapolation of the separated water volume to the moment when stirring was just terminated. Full emulsification of water was observed in a specific range of shear rates and below a critical water fraction, and only partial emulsification might occur above this critical water fraction. The range of shear rates in which full emulsification might occur became larger with a decrease in the water fraction, but it did not change with temperature in the studied range from 40 to 90 °C. For partial emulsification, the emulsified water fraction under flowing conditions was found to correlate well with the entropy production rate of viscous flow or energy dissipation rate regardless of the differences in water fraction, temperature, and shear rate, and a power law equation might well fit the data. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

In this study, the viscoelastic and yield behaviors of waxy crude emulsion gels were investigated, and analyses were then made by investigating the roles of wax particles and water droplets. Small amplitude oscillatory measurements were first carried out to study the effects of dispersed water on the structure and its evolution with time elapsing. Then, creep and recovery tests were conducted within the linear viscoelastic region to further investigate the viscoelastic behaviors of the emulsion gels. Further, the influence of dispersed water on the yield behaviors was studied by stress sweep measurements, and the effects of temperature, i.e., the precipitated wax, on the yield stress and yield strain were investigated by shear-rate-controlled loading measurements. The emulsion was found to become more elastic with the increase of the water cut, exhibiting phenomena such as the loss angle decreasing, storage modulus growing-up, the emulsion gelling at higher temperature, and strain recoverability increasing. The creep and recovery behavior may well be described by a mechanical analogy model with one Maxwell model and two Kelvin-Voigt models associated in series. Compared to the brittle structure of the gelled waxy crude oil as was reported in previous studies, the emulsion gels become more ductile with the increase of the water cut. The yield stresses of both the crude oil and the emulsion gels increase monotonically with the increase of the precipitated wax, and the yield strain of the emulsions with few precipitated wax particles increases with decreasing temperature, which is contrary to the waxy crude oil and the emulsions with low water cut, and interestingly the yield strain of emulsions may show both of these opposite trends, first increasing and then decreasing with the continuous decrease of temperature. All structural behavior differences between the emulsions and the waxy crude oil may be attributed to the roles that the dispersed water droplets may play and the interactions of the wax particles and the water droplets. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

0842326757	A new model for determining gel points of mixed crude	When the gel points of mixed crude of two types of oils with 1:1 mixing ratio were calculated by commonly used models, it is necessary to determine the gel points of every mixture of bicomponent crude with 1:1 mixing ratio, which causes great difficulties when the oil samples are unavailable. The analysis on the gel points of a large amount of crude mixtures showed that there exists a good correlativity between the measured values of gel points for mixed crude with 1:1 mixing ratio and the calculated ones by a linear weighted method. Based on this fact, a new method for calculating gel points of mixed crude with any mixing-ratio was put forward. This method has independence on the gel point of the mixed crude with 1:1 mixing ratio. The experimental data of mixed crude of five groups of two-component to five-component oils verified that the new calculating method has an average deviation equivalent to that of the commonly used models.

12844278098	Status and analysis of low temperature viscoelasticity of waxy crude oil	Waxy crude oil has the property of viscoelasticity at low temperature (near the gel point). The main research advances on low temperature viscoelasticity of waxy crude oil were summarized. Viscoelasticity of waxy crude oil originated from the structure of waxy crystal. The oscillation shear method is the most suitable for the viscoelasticity measurement of waxy crude oil. Viscoelasticity is related to some properties such as gel point, gel strength, yield stress and thixotropy. The main factors influencing the viscoelasticity are the thermal, shear history of waxy crude oil and wax precipitation characteristics. The existing problems were analyzed from two aspects of cogitation and research. The relations between viscoelsticity and yield stress, thixotropy need to be studied for the theoretical breakthrough. From the point of pipelining safety, the prediction model of gel status represented by viscoelastic parameters should be developed during the pipeline operation and shutdown.
