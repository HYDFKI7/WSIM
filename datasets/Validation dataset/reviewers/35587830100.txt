0029883874	Isolation of anti-leukemia compounds from Citrus reticulata	In vitro effects of medicinal plant extracts from the pericarpium of Citrus reticulata (cv Jiao Gan) (PCRJ) on the growth and differentiation of a recently characterized murine myeloid leukemic cell clone WEHI 3B (JCS) were investigated. Extracts of PCRJ not only inhibited the proliferation of JCS cells in a dose dependent manner, but also induced differentiation of JCS cells into macrophages and granulocytes. Morphological differentiation of PCRJ treated JCS cells was associated with an increase in phagocytic activity of the cells. Furthermore, both in vitro clonogenicity and in vivo growth of PCRJ treated JCS leukemic cells in syngeneic BALB/c mice were significantly reduced. The survival rate of mice receiving PCRJ treated JCS tumour cells was also increased. Using

0030902732	Involvement of interleukin-1 in the differentiation-inducing activity of tumor necrosis factor-α on a murine myeloid leukemia (WEHI-3B JCS)	We have shown previously that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibits the growth and induces the differentiation of a murine myelomonocytic leukemia (WEHI-3B JCS cells) into macrophage-like cells. In this study, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we found that both endogenous interleukin-1 α and β (IL-1α, IL-1β) mRNA were up-regulated upon TNF-α induction. Exogenous IL-1α and IL-1β also inhibited the growth as well as induced the differentiation of JCS cells, with IL-1β exerting a greater growth-inhibitory effect. Neutralizing anti-IL-1α, anti-IL-1β and anti-TNF-α antibodies were further used to elucidate the role of IL-1α, IL-1β and TNF-α in JCS cell differentiation. The results show that the IL-1α-induced monocytic differentiation of JCS cells was effectively blocked by anti-IL-1α as well as anti-IL-1β antibodies and to a lesser extent by anti-TNF-α antibody. In contrast, the differentiation-inducing effect of IL-1β on JCS cells was only blocked by anti-IL-1β antibody but not by anti-IL-1α or anti-TNF-α antibody. Finally, the TNF-α-induced monocytic differentiation of JCS cells was significantly blocked by anti-TNF-α and to a lesser extent by anti-IL-1α and anti-IL-1β antibodies. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-1β alone may directly trigger JCS cell differentiation whereas the differentiation-inducing effect of IL-1α may be via the endogenous production of IL-1β and/or TNF-α. In addition, IL-1α and IL-1β may be involved, at least in part, in TNF-α-induced monocytic differentiation of the JCS leukemia cells.

0030913875	Effects of biochanin A on the growth and differentiation of myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B (JCS) cells	The effects of biochanin A on the growth and differentiation of a recently characterized myeloid leukemia cell line WEHI-3B (JCS) were investigated. Biochanin A not only inhibited the growth of JCS cells in a dose-dependent manner (0-200 μM) but also induced the morphological differentiation of JCS cells. The phagocytic activity of biochanin A-treated JCS cells was also increased. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the expression of macrophage differentation markers Mac-1 and F4/80 was up-regulated in biochanin A-treated JCS cells. The expression level of Mac-1 was higher than that of F4/80. The expression of cytokine genes was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cycle titration. mRNA levels of IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-4 were found to be up-regulated at 46 hours after incubation of JCS cells with biochanin A. Although the expression of LIF was also up-regulated, the LIF receptor gene was not expressed in the uninduced or induced JCS cells. Our results that IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-4 may act on the later stage of biochanin A-mediated differentation of JCS cells.

0030976140	Effects of midazolam on the differentiation of murine myeloid leukemia cells	The effects of midazolam (MID) on the in vitro growth and differentiation of two murine myeloid leukemia WEHI 3B (JCS) and Ml cells were studied. MID inhibits the proliferation of both Ml and JCS cells in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 10 μg/ml, MID was found to induce both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of the JCS but not MI cells. Induction of morphological differentiation of the JCS cells was also associated with the enhanced expression of the differentiation antigens Mac-l, F4/80, and Gr-l for the cells. Results from mRNA phenotyping experiments also indicated that the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and neutrophil-specific Jl1d differentiation marker was significantly upregulated in MID-treated JCS cells. In addition, the phagocytic activity of MID-treated JCS cells was increased towards opsonized yeast cells. Results from this investigation suggested that MID may be used as an inducer for further study on the mechanisms of differentiation in these myeloid leukemia cells.

0031032536	Heavy metal pollution in children playgrounds in Hong Kong and its health implications	Due to the scarcity of land in Hong Kong, most of the children playgrounds are being built on marginal lands which may be subjected to serious atmospheric emission. Hence, children playing in these playgrounds are exposed to a potential health risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate heavy metal pollution in children playgrounds using surface dusts and soils as indicators. Surface dust and soil samples were collected from seven selected playgrounds with different levels of traffic volume and urban development for the determination of total Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations.

0031148307	A study of the binding of merocyanine 540 to myeloid leukemia M1 cells using an intensified charge-coupled device for fluorescence imaging microscopy	The binding of merocyanine 540 (MC540) to murine myeloid leukemia (M1) cells and normal erythrocytes was measured by fluorescence digital imaging microscopy using an intensified charge-coupled device. It was found that, on average, about three times more MC540 were bound to a unit membrane area of M1 cells than erythrocytes, a result consistent with previous studies. However, it was shown for the first time that MC540 binding varied significantly from one M1 cell to the next, and about 15% of the sensitized M1 cells were as MC540-negative as normal erythrocytes. Using the leukemic inhibitory factor as a differentiation inducer, M1 cells were induced to differentiate into mature macrophage-like cells in vitro. Such treatment lowered the average MC540 binding by about one-third but did not affect the cell-to-cell variation significantly.

24044455371	The anti-angiogenic effect of sinomenine	Sinomenine is an alkaloid extracted from the Chinese medicinal plant, Sinomenium acutum, which has been utilized to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China for over 2000 years. Sinomenine has been shown to mediate a wide range of pharmacological actions which includes anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic effects. RA has been classified as a chronic immune-mediated disease that exhibits overlapping manifestation of inflammatory, abnormal cellular and hormonal immune responses with synovial hyperplasia. Since, angiogenesis is recognized to play a critical role in the development of RA and anti-angiogenic therapy has been proposed as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of RA, we would like to see if sinomenine possesses anti-angiogenic property. In this study, sinomenine inhibited bFGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and arrested its cell cycle in G1 phase. Sinomenine disrupted tube formation of HUVEC on Matrigel and suppressed the chemotaxis of HUVEC. In addition, sinomenine reduced neovascularization in Matrigel plug assay as well as microvascular outgrowth in rat aorta ring sprouting assay. These results suggest that sinomenine inhibited bFGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. As the leukocytes-endothelial adhesive interactions also play an important role in inflammation, we found that sinomenine reduced the transmigration of granulocytic differentiated HL60 cells across IL-1β activated HUVEC monolayer. Therefore, the inhibition of leukocytes migration across blood vessel walls and the anti-angiogenic effect of sinomenine may contribute towards its therapeutic mechanisms in alleviating the pathogenesis of RA. © Springer 2005.

26844510900	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1-mediated activation of stanniocalcin-1 in human cancer cells	Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is an endocrine hormone originally discovered in the corpuscles of Stannius, endocrine glands on kidneys of bony fishes, and also has been identified in mammals. The mammalian STC1 gene is widely expressed in various tissues and appears to be involved in diverse biological processes. There is growing evidence to suggest that altered patterns of gene expression have a role in human cancer development. Recently STC1 has been identified as a stimulator of mitochondrial respiration and has been hypothesized to be functionally related to the Warburg effect, of which hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 plays a key role in reprogramming tumor metabolism. This prompted us to examine the involvement of HIF-1 in the regulation of STC1 expression in tumor hypoxia. Our data reveal that hypoxia can stimulate STC1 gene expression in various human cancer cell lines, including those derived from colon carcinomas, nasopharyngeal cancer (CNE-2, HONE-1, HK-1), and ovarian cancer (CaOV3, OVCAR3, SKOV3). By far, the greatest response was observed in CNE-2 cells. In further studies on CNE-2 cells, desferrioxamine, cobalt chloride, and O

30344453908	Cytokines in the differentiation therapy of leukemia: From laboratory investigations to clinical applications	Differentiation therapy of leukemia is the treatment of leukemia cells with biological or chemical agents that induce the terminal differentiation of the cancer cells. It is regarded as a novel and targeted approach to leukemia treatment, based on our better understanding of the hematopoietic process and the mechanisms of its deregulation during leukemogenesis. Clinically, differentiation therapy has been most successful in acute promyelocytic leukemia using all-trans-retinoic acid as the inducer, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. This review presents evidence that a number of hematopoietic cytokines play important roles in both normal and aberrant hematopoietic processes. In vitro laboratory investigations in the past two decades using well-characterized myeloid leukemic cell lines and primary blast cells from leukemia patients have revealed that many hematopoietic cytokines can trigger lineage-specific differentiation of leukemia cells, which may have important implications in the clinical setting. Moreover, our current understanding of cytokine interactions and the molecular mechanisms of cytokine-induced leukemic cell differentiation will be discussed in the light of recent findings. Finally, ways in which laboratory research on cytokines in the differentiation therapy of leukemia can lead to the improved design of protocols for future clinical applications to leukemia therapy will also be addressed.

33644771349	Comparison of merocyanine 540-mediated photodynamic action on leukemia cells between pulsed and continuous wave light sources	Whether a pulsed laser is superior to a continuous wave (CW) light source in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer is still unclear and contradictory in the literature. Although photosaturation of a sensitizer and oxygen depletion in tumor have been considered to be involved during pulsed laser irradiation, there is a lack of experimental data. In the present work several parameters such as the amount of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in cells, the oxygen concentration in cells, and the amount of photos reaching cells during pulsed laser irradiation, were studied to compare the MC540-mediated PDT effects of a pulsed laser and a CW light source on murine myeloid WEH-3B (JCS) cells in vitro. The results showed that the pulsed laser was less effective at cell inactivation than the CW light under the same irradiation dose. However, when the energy of the pulsed laser was reduced from 0.25 to 0.06 mJ/cm

33644779932	Photodynamic effect of curcumin on NPC/CNE2 cells	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly prevalent in Southern China. Radiotherapy is the primary treatment of NPC, but the rate of tumor recurrence is significant. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and the use of natural compounds become one of the new approaches in the investigation of NPC treatment. PDT is an alternate method of cancer treatment while curcumin (CUR) is a compound derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) herbs. The purpose of the study focuses on the photodynamic effect of CUR on one of the NPC cell lines, NPC/CNE2. Cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity of CUR were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimthyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. Uptake kinetics of CUR in NPC/CNE2 was examined by flow cytometry. The mode of cell death induced by CUR was studied by fluorescence microscopy. Summarizing the results, CUR showed dark cytotoxicity as well as photocytotoxic effects on NPC/CNE2 cells. LC50 of CUR in the dark was about 16 μM. The cytotoxicity of CUR was enhanced by the irradiation of visible light and blue filtered light (maximum transmittance at 300∼400 nm) with light doses of 300 kJ/m2 and 60 kJ/m

33646192904	Involvement of protein kinase C and E2F-5 in euxanthone-induced neurite differentiation of neuroblastoma	Euxanthone, a neuritogenic agent isolated from the medicinal herb Polygala caudata, has been shown to induce morphological differentiation and neurite outgrowth in murine neuroblastoma Neuro 2a cells (BU-1 subclone). In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of euxanthone-induced neurite outgrowth, a proteomic approach was employed. In the present study, two dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry were performed to investigate the alterations in protein expression profile of euxanthone-treated BU-1 cells. Fourteen identified proteins were changed in expression levels after induction of neurite growth. These proteins included participants in transcription and cell cycle regulation, calcium influx and calcium signaling, fatty acid metabolism, cytoskeleton reorganization, casein kinase signal transduction, putative transbilayer amphipath transport and protein biosynthesis. Among the 14 identified proteins, E2F transcription factor 5 (E2F-5) was significantly up-regulated after euxanthone treatment. Go6976, a protein kinase C (PKC) α/βI inhibitor, was found to inhibit neuritogenesis and expression of E2F-5 in the euxanthone-treated BU-1 cells, while SH-6, the Akt/PKB inhibitor, had no inhibitory effect. The gene silencing of E2F-5 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was found to abolish the euxanthone-induced neurite outgrowth. In conclusion, these results indicated that the transcription factor E2F-5 was actively involved in the regulation of euxanthone-induced neurite outgrowth via PKC pathway. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33646556664	Signaling pathway of ginsenoside-Rg1 leading to nitric oxide production in endothelial cells	We here provide definitive evidence that ginsenoside-Rg1, the pharmacologically active component of ginseng, is a functional ligand of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as determined by fluorescence polarization assay. Rg1 increased the phosphorylation of GR, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt/PKB and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) leading to increase nitric oxide (NO) production in human umbilical vein endothelial cell. Rg1-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production were significantly reduced by RU486, LY294,002, or SH-6. Also, knockdown of GR completely eliminated the Rg1-induced NO production. This study revealed that Rg1 can indeed serve as an agonist ligand for GR and the activated GR can induce rapid NO production from eNOS via the non-transcriptional PI3K/Akt pathway. © 2006 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

33747869617	Bifunctional modulating effects of an indigo dimer (bisindigotin) to CYP1A1 induction in H4IIE cells	In this study, we measured and characterized the bifunctional effects of a newly identified natural compound-bisindigotin (SLY-1), isolated from leaf extracts of Isatis indigotica, to CYP1A1/EROD activities in H4IIE cells. The compound, SLY-1 (1 μM) elicited a transitory and significant induction of CYP1A1 RNA/protein levels and EROD activities in the cells. Maximum levels of CYP1A1 expression and EROD induction were attained at 8 and 12 h of post-treatment, respectively. Thereafter the induction decreased significantly. Similar profile of CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 mRNA induction was observed. In contrast TCDD elicited CYP1A1/EROD induction was persistent. The transitory effect by SLY-1 is most likely due to the clearance of SLY-1 by cellular metabolism. Taken together the observation indicated that SLY-1 is an Ah receptor agonist for CYP1A1/CYP1A2/CYP1B1/EROD induction. Interestingly in the TCDD/SLY-1 cotreatment study, although synergistic effects on CYP1A1 expression and EROD induction were observed at 4-8 h, significant inhibitory effects to TCDD induced CYP1A1 protein and EROD activity were detected at 12-24 h of post-treatment. Because there was no significant reduction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 or CYP1B1 transcript levels between TCDD- and TCDD/SLY-1 treated cells, the data pointed to the translational and/or post-translational inhibitory effect. The cellular signal transduction system may be modulated following exposure to SLY-1. To investigate the possible mechanisms involved, various specific kinase inhibitors or activators (chelerythrin, PD98059, U0126, ZM336372, SB202190, PKA inhibitor PKI (6-22) amide, and dbcAMP) were used for the assessment. Chelerythrine, PD98059 or dbcAMP treatment in TCDD induced cells showed significant inhibitory effects on CYP1A1 mRNA/protein expressions and EROD activities. U0126 had no observable EROD inhibitory effect. ZM336372 or SB202190 showed inhibition only at EROD activities. The results indicated that the SLY-1 inhibitory effect was possibly not mediated by the cAMP/PKA, PKC or MEK pathways. Nevertheless our results indicate that SLY-1 is not only an inducer of the CYP1A1 system, but also a potent inhibitor of CYP1A1 enzyme. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

33746874408	Cell death induced by MPPa-PDT in prostate carcinoma in vitro and in vivo	Lack of effective photosensitizers has become a major limit for extensive application of photodynamic therapy. In this study, the photocytotoxicity and mode of death induced by a newly developed photosensitizer MPPa, a derivative of chlorophyll a, were investigated in PC-3M cell line, a highly metastatic variant of poorly differentiated androgen-independent proctanec adenocarcinoma PC-3. MTT reduction assay was used to measure cytotoxicity in both PC-3M and HUVEC, after which a flow cytometer was used to measure apoptotic rate and cell cycle, and then Caspase-3, -8, -9 were investigated. Finally, an animal model was set up to embody the curative effect and for histopathological examinations. The photocytotoxicity of MPPa showed both light- and drug-dose dependent characteristics and no significant dark cytotoxicity was observed in PC-3M cells.

K. et al., Proc SPIE, 2006, Vol. 6139, p268). To explore the heavy-atom effect on corrole photosensitizer, an exact analogue of corole 1 with the modification of two heavy iodine atoms on its 10-phenyl group, 10-(2-hydroxyl-3 ,5-diiodophenyl)-5 ,15-bis (pentafluorophenyl) corrole (2), was synthesized. Surprisingly, the photocytoxicity of corrole 2 on NPC cell dropped sharply as compared to corrole 1. It exhibited no significant PDT cytotoxicity even if its concentration reached 2 μmol/L. This may be caused by the lowering of its singlet oxygen quantum yield in PDT, although the intersystem crossing of corrole 2 could be enhanced by iodine heavy-atom effect as indicated by the strong decrease of its fluorescence emission.

33845981082	Apoptosis and expression of cytokines triggered by pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester-mediated photodynamic therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells	The photodynamic properties of pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester (MPPa), a semi-synthetic photosensitizer derived from chlorophyll a, were evaluated in a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma HONE-1 cell line. MPPa was non-toxic to the HONE-1. At the concentrations of 0.5-2 μM, MPPa-mediated a drug dose-dependent photocytotoxicity in the HONE-1 cells. Confocal microscopy revealed a subcellular localization of MPPa in mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. MPPa PDT-induced apoptosis was associated with the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, the up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (calnexin, Grp 94 and Grp78), and the activation of caspases-3 and -9. The photocytotoxicity was reduced by the corresponding specific caspase inhibitors. MPPa PDT-treated HONE-1 cells also up-regulated the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and beta-chemokines (MIP-1β, MPIF-1, and MPIF-2). These results suggest that the MPPa may be developed as a chlorophyll-based photosensitizer for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33846890205	Neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside-Rg1 in primary nigral neurons against rotenone toxicity	Ginsenoside-Rg1, the pharmacologically active component isolated from ginseng, demonstrated neuroprotective effects on primary cultured rat nigral neurons against rotenone toxicity. Rotenone, a common household pesticide known for its specific and irreversible mitochondria complex I inhibition, has been suggested to be the causal agent of Parkinson's disease (PD) by inducing degeneration of cells in the substantial nigra. The present study demonstrated that co-treatment of rotenone and Rg1 could reduce rotenone-induced cell death by 58% (SEM = ±5.60; N = 3). Rotenone-induced mitochondria membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm) depletion was restored and elevated by at least 38% (SEM = ±2.15; N = 3) by Rg1. In addition, Rg1 prevented cytochrome c release from the mitochrondrial membrane and increased the phosphorylation inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The protective effects of Rg1 was blocked by glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, indicating that the action of Rg1 is mediated through glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In conclusion, Rg1 inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and increases the survival chance of the primary cultured nigral neurons against rotenone toxicity. Thus, Rg1 and its related compounds may be developed as protective agents against neurodegenerative diseases induced by mitochondrial toxins. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34250887454	Pharmacogenomics and the Yin/Yang actions of ginseng: Anti-tumor, angiomodulating and steroid-like activities of ginsenosides	In Chinese medicine, ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) has long been used as a general tonic or an adaptogen to promote longevity and enhance bodily functions. It has also been claimed to be effective in combating stress, fatigue, oxidants, cancer and diabetes mellitus. Most of the pharmacological actions of ginseng are attributed to one type of its constituents, namely the ginsenosides. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the study of ginsenosides on angiogenesis which is related to many pathological conditions including tumor progression and cardiovascular dysfunctions. Angiogenesis in the human body is regulated by two sets of counteracting factors, angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors.

34548694076	Analysis of the action of euxanthone, a plant-derived compound that stimulates neurite outgrowth	We have investigated the neurite growth-stimulating properties of euxanthone, a xanthone derivative isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Polygala caudata. Euxanthone was shown to exert a marked stimulatory action on neurite outgrowth from chick embryo dorsal root ganglia explanted in collagen gels, in the absence of added neurotrophins. It was also shown to promote cell survival in explanted chick embryo ganglia, and to stimulate neurite outgrowth from isolated adult rat primary sensory neurons in vitro. The further finding that euxanthone stimulates neurite outgrowth from explants of chick embryo retina and ventral spinal cord suggests an action on signaling pathways downstream of neuronal receptors for specific neurotrophic factors. Consistent with this, euxanthone did not promote neurite outgrowth from non-transfected PC12 cells, or from PC12 cells transfected with TrkB or TrkC, under conditions in which these cells extended neurites in response to, respectively, the neurotrophins nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin 3. Western blot analysis of euxanthone-stimulated dorsal root ganglion explants showed that expression of phospho-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was up-regulated after 1 h of euxanthone-treatment. Inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway using PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase, blocked all euxanthone-stimulated neurite outgrowth. However, analysis of phospho-Akt expression indicated that the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-Akt pathway, another major signaling pathway engaged by neurotrophins, is not significantly activated by euxanthone. These results suggest that euxanthone promotes neurite outgrowth by selectively activating the MAP kinase pathway. © 2007 IBRO.

34948887630	Ginsenoside Rb1 inhibits tube-like structure formation of endothelial cells by regulating pigment epithelium-derived factor through the oestrogen β receptor	Background and purpose: Angiogenesis is a crucial step in tumour growth and metastasis. Ginsenoside-Rb1 (Rb1), the major active constituent of ginseng, potently inhibits angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesized that the potent anti-angiogenic protein, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), is involved in regulating the anti-angiogenic effects of Rb1. Experimental approaches: Rb1-induced PEDF was determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The anti-angiogenic effects of Rb1 were demonstrated using endothelial cell tube formation assay. Competitive ligand-binding and reporter gene assays were employed to indicate the interaction between Rb1 and the oestrogen receptor (ER). Key results: Rb1 significantly increased the transcription, protein expression and secretion of PEDF. Targeted inhibition of PEDF completely prevented Rb1-induced inhibition of endothelial tube formation, suggesting that the anti-angiogenic effect of Rb1 was PEDF specific. Interestingly, the activation of PEDF occurred via a genomic pathway of ERβ. Competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that Rb1 is a specific agonist of ERβ, but not ERα. Rb1 effectively recruited transcriptional activators and activated an oestrogen-responsive reporter gene. Furthermore, Rb1-mediated PEDF activation and the subsequent inhibition of tube formation were blocked by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 or transfection of ERβ siRNA, indicating ERβ dependence. Conclusions and implications: Here we show for the first time that the Rb1 suppressed the formation of endothelial tube-like structures through modulation of PEDF via ERβ. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of the action of this ginsenoside that may have value in anti-cancer and anti-angiogenesis therapy. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

It was found for the first time that MC540 not only being localized in the plasma membrane but also in the cytoplasm and the nuclear membrane of the murine myeloid leukemia M1 and WEHI 3B (JCS) cells. Exposure of MC540 treated leukemia cells to light under conditions that could cause photobleaching did not cause the redistribution of cell-bound MC540. Rapid localization of MC540 in the cytoplasm was observed for 5 minutes after exposure of leukemia cell to MC540, it indicates that MC540 could promptly be internalized by these two leukemia cell lines. In contrast, localization of MC540 was limited only to the plasma membrane of erythrocytes. These results suggest that the binding pattern of MC540 is cell type dependent and may be related to the efficacy of photosensitization in photodynamic therapy.

Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorescent organelle probes, we examined the subcellular localization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in the murine myeloid leukemia M1 and WEHI 3B (JCS) cells. Two patterns of localization were observed: in JCS cells, MC540 was found to localize on the plasma membrane and mitochondria; and in M1 leukemia cells, MC540 was found to localize on lysosomes. The relationship between subcellular localization of MC540 and PDT-induced apoptosis was investigated. Apoptotic cell death, as judged by the formation of apoptotic nuclei, was observed 4 h after irradiation in both leukemia cell lines. Typical ladders of apoptotic DNA fragments were also detected by DNA gel electrophoresis in PDT-treated JCS and M1 cells. At the irradiation dose of 46 kJ/m

33644819855	Conjugated linoleic acid induces monocytic differentiation of murine myeloid leukemia cells	Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a group of naturally occurring positional and geometrical conjugated dienoic isomers of linoleic acid (CI8:2), of which the cis- 9,trans-ll (c9,tll) and trans-l0,cis-l2 (t 10,c 12) isomers predominate. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that CLA isomers are capable of inhibiting the growth of a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro; however, their modulatory effects on the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells remain poorly understood. In the present study, CLA was shown to inhibit the proliferation of murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Morphological, flow cytometric and functional analyses revealed that CLA induced the differentiation of WEHI-3B JCS cells into matured macrophage-like cells, as indicated by increases in the cytoplasm:nucleus ratio and vacuolation, the expression of macrophage differentiation antigens (Mac-1 and F4/80) and the enhanced monocytic serine esterase activity of CLA-treated WEHI-3B JCS cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that CLA up-regulated the expression of TNF-a, IL-16 and IFN-y genes in WEHI-3B JCS cells, which had previously been shown to play an important role in triggering the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, CLA-treated WEHI-3B JCS cells had also shown reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Collectively, our results indicate that CLA might exert its growth-inhibitory effects on myeloid leukemia cells by triggering their terminal differentiation, which is mediated, at least in part, by modulation of the cytokine gene expression in the leukemia cells.

34248559426	Angiomodulatory and neurological effects of ginsenosides	Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, one of the most popular and valued herbs, has been used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. More than thirty ginsenosides, the pharmacologically active ingredients in ginseng, have been identified with various sugar moieties attached at the C-3, C-6 and C-20 positions of the steroidal skeleton. We herein review the current literature on the pharmacological effects of ginsenosides on the modulation of angiogenesis, dysregulations of which contribute towards many pathological conditions. Regarding the adaptogenic property of ginseng, the effects of ginsenosides on central nervous system are also discussed. Recent researches have pointed to the steroid hormone receptors as the target molecules to elicit the diverse cellular and physiological activities of ginseng. We believe that understanding the interaction between ginsenosides and various steroid hormone receptors may provide clues to unravel the secret of ginseng. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

34247853460	Characterization of murine interferon-alpha 12 (MuIFN-α12): Biological activities and gene expression	Interferon alpha (IFN-α) belongs to the type I interferon family and consists of multiple subtypes in many species. In the mouse, there are at least 14 IFN-α genes and 3 IFN-α pseudogenes, the most recently identified of which are murine interferon-alpha 12 (MuIFN-α12), MuIFN-α13 and MuIFN-α14. To further study the biological activities of MuIFN-α12, we have produced a recombinant MuIFN-α12 (rMuIFN-α12) protein using COS-1 cells. rMuIFN-α12 was found to inhibit the growth of murine myeloid leukemia JCS cells. Flow cytofluorometric analysis with propidium iodide staining showed that the growth inhibitory activity of rMuIFN-α12 may be caused by the induction of apoptosis. Flow cytofluorometric analysis also revealed that rMuIFN-α12 was able to up-regulate the expression of MHC-I on both JCS cells and primary macrophages. Functional studies indicated that a MuIFN-α12 transgene could induce an anti-viral state in L929 cells against Influenza A virus. Moreover, expression of MuIFN-α12 was not detectable by RT-PCR in untreated, Influenza A virus infected, polyI:polyC induced L929 cells, or in a wide range of normal murine tissues. Taken together, this data shows that MuIFN-α12 is a protein with all the biological traits of a type I IFN. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0034285101	Cellular uptake, subcellular localization and photodamaging effect of Temoporfin (mTHPC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells: Comparison with hematoporphyrin derivative	Temoporfin (meta-tetra (hydroxyphenyl)chlorin; mTHPC) potentiated a 100- fold higher cytotoxic effect than hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) on two nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines (HK1 and CNE2) in terms of the overall photodynamic therapy (PDT) dose. The cellular uptake, evaluated by flow cytometry and spectrophotometry demonstrated that mTHPC exhibited higher uptake ability than HPD. Confocal laser scanning microscopy detection for both the sensitizer and mitochondria probe on the same cell images revealed that both drugs accumulated diffusely in the cytoplasm and that mitochrondria is a target organelle. Photo-activation ruptured the mitochrondria, with more pronounced mitochondrial damage being observed in mTHPC-PDT course. This correlated well with the cell photokilling efficiency of mTHPC.

0034309791	The binding characteristics and intracellular localization of temoporfin (mTHPC) in myeloid leukemia cells: Phototoxicity and mitochondrial damage	The state of aggregation of the photosensitizer meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC) in both cell free and intracellular environment was elucidated by comparing its absorption and excitation spectra. In methanol, mTHPC existed as monomers and strongly fluoresced. In aqueous solutions such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), mTHPC formed nonfluorescent aggregates. Some portion of mTHPC monomerized in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum PBS. In murine myeloid leukemia M1 and WEHI-3B (JCS) cells, cytoplasmic mTHPC were monomeric. By using organelle-specific fluorescent probes, it was found that mTHPC localized preferentially at the mitochondria and the perinuclear region. Photodynamic treatment of mTHPC-sensitized leukemia cells caused rapid appearance of the apoptogenic protein cytochrome c in the cytosol. Results from flow cytometric analysis showed that the release of cytochrome c was especially pronounced in JCS cells, and well correlated with the extent of apoptotic cell death as reported earlier. Electron microscopy revealed the loss of integrity of the mitochondrial membrane and the appearance of chromatin condensation as early as 1 h after light irradiation. We conclude that rapid release of cytochrome c from photodamaged mitochondria is responsible for the mTHPC-induced apoptosis in the myeloid leukemia JCS and M1 cells.

0034941094	Expression of protein kinase C isoforms in euxanthone-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells	Euxanthone, a potent neuritogenic compound isolated from the roots of the medicinal herb Polygala caudata, has recently been shown to induce the differentiation of murine neuroblastoma Neuro 2A (BU-1) cells. In this study, the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and the expression of various PKC isoforms in euxanthone-treated BU-1 cells were examined, mRNA phenotyping using the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that BU-1 cells express six different PKC isoforms, namely PKC-α, -β, -δ, -ε, -λ, and -ζ, Differential regulation and expression of PKC isoforms was observed in BU-1 cells treated with 100 μM euxanthone. PKC-α, -β, -δ, -λ, and -ζ were all up-regulated, with 1.7- to 9.5-fold increase, at around 30 to 60 minutes after euxanthone treatment. The expression level of PKC-ε remained relatively constant during the treatment. PKC-γ -η, and -Θ were not detected in both untreated and euxanthone-treated BU-1 cells. Staurosporine, a broad spectrum PKC inhibitor, was found to inhibit both spontaneous and euxanthone-induced neuritogenesis in BU-1 cells. A significant reduction of the euxanthone-induced neuritogenic effect was also observed when the PKC isoform-specific inhibitor Go6976 was included in the culture. These results suggest that the euxanthone-induced differentiation of the neuroblastoma BU-1 cells may be mediated through the differential expression of PKC-α, -β, -δ, -λ and -ζ isoforms.

84897554978	Ginsenoside compound K induces apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells via activation of apoptosis-inducing factor	Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a high incidence rate in Southern China. Although there are conventional therapies, the side effects and toxicities are not always tolerable for patients. Recently, the tumoricidal effect of ginsenosides on different cancer cells has been studied. This study aims to investigate the anti-cancer effect of ginsenosides on NPC cells and their underlying mechanism.Methods: The cytotoxicity of ginsenosides on NPC cell line HK-1 was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry. A xenograft tumor model was established by injecting nude mice with HK-1 cells. The activation of caspases and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Nuclear translocation of AIF was also studied by immunofluorescence staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by JC-1 dye using flow cytometry.Results: Four ginsenosides, 20 (S)-Rh

53049106581	Hepatocyte growth factor enhances proteolysis and invasiveness of human nasopharyngeal cancer cells through activation of PI3K and JNK	The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, Met, is frequently overexpressed in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Here, we showed for the first time that human NPC cells with high Met expression were more sensitive to the cell motility and invasion effect of HGF. The downregulation of Met by small interfering RNA decreased tumor cell invasion/migration. HGF significantly increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 production. This was inhibited by blocking phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. We also demonstrated that PI3K induced activation of JNK, with Akt as a potential point of this cross-talk. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism responsible for NPC progression and metastasis. © 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

69649097192	Role of p38 mapks in hypericin photodynamic therapy-induced apoptosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells	The present study aims to determine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in hypericin-mediated photodynamic therapy (HY-PDT)-induced apoptosis of the HK-1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. HY-PDT was found to induce proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 and -3 in HK-1 cells. Apoptotic nuclei were observed at 6 h after PDT whereas B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2- associated-X-protein (Bax) translocation and formation of Bax channel is responsible for the cell death. Increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPKs and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) was detected at 15-30 min after HY-PDT. The appearance of phosphorylated form of p38 MAPKs and JNK1/2 was inhibited by the singlet oxygen scavenger l-histidine. HY-PDT-induced cell death was enhanced by the chemical inhibitors for p38 MAPKs (SB202190 and SB203580), but not by the JNKs inhibitor SP600125. Knockdown of the p38α and p38β MAPK isoforms by small interfering RNA (siRNA) are more effective than the p38 in enhancing PDT-induced cell death. Augmentation of apoptosis by p38α or p38β knockdown is also correlated with the increased proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 after HY-PDT treatment. Our results suggested that HY-PDT activated p38 MAPKs through the production of singlet oxygen. Inhibition of p38 MAPKs with chemical inhibitors or siRNA enhances HY-PDT-induced apoptosis of the HK-1 NPC cells. © 2009 The American Society of Photobiology.

70349813767	Role of MicroRNA-214 in ginsenoside-Rg1-induced angiogenesis	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional gene modulators. Ginsenoside-Rg1, one of the active components of ginseng, has been confirmed as an angiogenesis inducer. Using miRNA microarray analysis, a total of 17 (including miR-214) and 5 miRNAs were found to be down- or up-regulated by Rg1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), respectively. Since miR-214 is closely related to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and hence angiogenesis, its expression was further validated by qRT-PCR. We also investigated the role of miR-214 on eNOS expression and in tubulogenesis and motility of HUVEC by transfection of specific miRNA inhibitor or precursor. Our results suggested that Rg1 can down-regulate miR-214 expression in HUVEC, leading to an increase in eNOS expression, and in vitro cell migration and tube formation which can possibly promote angiogenesis. These results signify a new understanding towards how a simple natural compound can affect physiological changes through modulation of miRNA expression. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

70350754348	Modulatory effects and action mechanisms of tryptanthrin on murine myeloid leukemia cells	Leukemia is the disorder of hematopoietic cell development and is characterized by an uncoupling of cell proliferation and differentiation. There is a pressing need for the development of novel tactics for leukemia therapy as conventional treatments often have severe adverse side effects. Tryptanthrin (6,12-dihydro-6,12-dioxoindolo-(2,1-b)-quinazoline) is a naturally-occurring, weakly basic alkaloid isolated from the dried roots of medicinal indigo plants (Ban-Lan-Gen). It has been reported to have various biological and pharmacological activities, including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-tumor effects. However, its modulatory effects and action mechanisms on myeloid cells remain poorly understood. In this study, tryptanthrin was shown to suppress the proliferation of the murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It also significantly reduced the growth of WEHI-3B JCS cells in vivo in syngeneic BALB/c mice. However, it exhibited no significant direct cytotoxicity on normal murine peritoneal macrophages. Flow cytometric analysis showed an obvious cell cycle arrest of the tryptanthrin-treated WEHI-3B JCS cells at the G0/G1 phase. The expression of cyclin D2, D3, Cdk 2, 4 and 6 genes in WEHI-3B JCS cells was found to be down-regulated at 24 h as measured by RT-PCR. Morphological and functional studies revealed that tryptanthrin could induce differentiation in WEHI-3B JCS cells, as shown by the increases in vacuolation, cellular granularity and NBT-reducing activity in tryptanthrin-treated cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that tryptanthrin might exert its anti-tumor effect on the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells by causing cell cycle arrest and by triggering cell differentiation. ©2009 Chinese Society of Immunology and University of Science & Technology of China.

In vitro study using human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells showed that Ru-P exhibited a strong two-photon induced fluorescence upon uptake, lysosomal localization and potent two-photon induced cytotoxicity. These results show that Ru-P, which was designed to enhance its cellular uptake, can potentially be used as an efficacious bifunctional two-photon tumor-imaging and photodynamic therapeutic agent despite its moderate two-photon absorption cross-section. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

74149083977	2-Methoxyestradiol induces endoreduplication through the induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress and the activation of MAPK signaling pathways	2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a normal physiological metabolite of 17β-estradiol with anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activities. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the mechanism whereby 2ME2 induces endoreduplication of the well-differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. We report here that 2ME2 induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest followed by endoreduplication of the well-differentiated HK-1 cells. The increase in chromosome number was confirmed by cytogenetic study. Analysis of stress signaling pathways revealed the phosphorylation activation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs at various times after 2ME2 treatment. Pre-treatment of 2ME2-treated HK-1 cells with JNK inhibitor (SP600125), ERK inhibitor (PD98059) and p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) resulted in the reduction of endoreduplicating cells. Furthermore, the increase in the phosphorylation of JNK was accompanied by an increase in the reactive oxygen species. In addition, endoreduplication was observed in cells after treatment with superoxide donor, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphoquinone (DMNQ). Confocal microscopic analysis also revealed the increase in mitochondrial superoxide anion in 2ME2-treated HK-1 cells. Pre-treatment of HK-1 cells with superoxide dismutase mimetic 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) or overexpressing the mitochondrial enzyme MnSOD resulted in the reduction of phosphorylation of JNK and the formation of endoreduplicating cells. Furthermore, the tubulin filaments in cytoplasm remain intact in 2ME2-treated HK-1 cells after pre-treatment of TEMPO. Our results suggest that 2ME2 induces endoreduplication through the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of MAPK signal pathways. The biological significance of drug-induced endoreduplication will also be discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77649250212	Quantum dot-mediated photoproduction of reactive oxygen species for cancer cell annihilation	While semiconductor quantum dots produce little singlet oxygen, they may undergo Type I photoreactions to produce other reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cells. CdTe quantum dots coated with thioglycolic acid were used to test that possibility. Some thiol ligands were purposely removed to regenerate the surface electron traps that were passivated by the ligand. This allowed photoinduced electrons to dwell on the surface long enough to be gathered by nearby oxygen molecules to produce ROS. The photocytotoxicity of these quantum dots was tested on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Photokilling was shown to be drug and light dose dependent.

The strong H-bonding and electrostatic interaction between the organic dye and the QDs entice the positively charged nuclear staining agent in carrying effectively the bright QDs into the nucleus of living cells. Dynamic confocal imaging studies indicated that all visible light emitting NAC-capped QDs with emitting wavelength ranging from 530 to 602 nm can be successfully targeted to the nucleus of the living cells within 30 min. The minimum quantity of Hoechst 33342 as the anchoring agent required in carrying QDs to the nucleus is found to be 5 μg/mL. In essence, a simple, fast, and specific bioimaging of the nucleus in living cells by QDs is accomplished. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77951678088	Anti-inflammatory protein of schistosoma japonicum directs the differentiation of the WEHI-3B JCS cells and mouse bone marrow cells to macrophages	Sj16 is an anti-inflammatory protein identified from Schistosoma japonicum. Our previous studies showed that recombinant Sj16 (rSj16) could suppress host's inflammatory responses and inhibit macrophage maturation. In the present study, the effects of rSj16 on the differentiation of the murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cell line and on mouse hematopoiesis were investigated. Our data demonstrated that rSj16 expressed and purified from Escherichia coli could suppress the proliferation of the WEHI-3B JCS cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, while not affect the viability of the cells. Further studies indicated that rSj16 induced macrophage differentiation of the WEHI-3B JCS cells, and arrested the cell cycle in the G1/G0 and G2/M phases. The macrophage differentiation of the rSj16-treated WEHI-3B JCS cells was confirmed by their expression of macrophage specific antigen F4/80 and phagocytic activity. Furthermore, our results revealed that rSj16 biased the colony formation of mouse bone marrow cells towards macrophage linage. © 2010 Shaomin Hu et al.

77952326078	A Simplified Method for Quantifying Cell Migration/Wound Healing in 96-Well Plates	Cell migration plays a key role in both normal physiological and pathological conditions. The study of cell migration and its underlying mechanisms is of great significance in various fields of research, including basic biology and pharmaceutical development. The cell migration or scratch wounding assay is an easy and economical in vitro method that allows researchers to assess a large number of testing compounds. Even though this simple assay has been used for decades, researchers are still trying to modify such experimental protocols and wounding devices. In this study, an 8-channel mechanical "wounder" was designed for performing a cell migration assay, particularly in a 96-well culture plate format. With special designs of a guiding bar and adjustable pins for use with disposable pipette tips, this wounder confined the scratch area within the center of each well to ensure a perfect contact between the pins and the well surface. As a result, this mechanical wounder produces a uniform denudation of a cell monolayer in a 96-well plate with a wound size of around 600 μm. Using this improved wounding device, the effects of epidermal growth factor and DL-α- difluoromethylornithine on the reepithelialization of rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) and serum on the wound recovery of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were demonstrated. This wounder facilitates cell migration study and can be applicable for multiple sample analysis. © 2010 Society for Biomolecular Sciences.

77953558733	Role of mitogen-activated protein kinase in Zn-BC-AM PDT-induced apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with a recently developed photosensitizer Zn-BC-AM was found to effectively induce apoptosis in a welldifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) HK-1 cell line. Sustained activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cjun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as a transient increase in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were observed immediately after Zn-BC-AM PDT. A commonly used p38 MAPK/JNK pharmacological inhibitor PD169316 was found to reduce PDTinduced apoptosis of HK-1 cells. PD169316 also prevented the loss of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in PDT-treated HK-1 cells. However, inhibition of JNK with SP600125 had no effect on Zn-BC-AM PDT-induced apoptosis while inhibition of ERK with PD98059 or p38 MAPK with SB203580 significantly increased Zn-BC-AM PDT-induced apoptosis. Further study showed that knockdown of the p38b isoform with siRNA also increased Zn-BC-AM PDT-induced apoptosis, indicating that the anti-apoptotic effect of PD169316 in PDT-treated HK-1 cells was probably independent of p38 MAPK or JNK activation. Taken together, the results suggest that inhibition of p38b and ERK may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Zn-BC-AM PDTon NPC cells. It should be noted that data only based on the use of PD169316 should be interpreted in caution. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

77957266945	Photodynamic therapy-mediated modulation of inflammatory cytokine production by Epstein-Barr virus-infected nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. This study aims to examine the effects of EBV infection on the production of proinflammatory cytokines in NPC cells after the Zn-BC-AM photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment. Cells were treated with the photosensitiser Zn-BC-AM for 24 h before light irradiation. Quantitative ELISA was used to evaluate the production of cytokines. Under the same experimental condition, HK-1-EBV cells produced a higher basal level of IL-1α (1561 pg/ml), IL-1Β (16.6 pg/ml) and IL-8 (422.9 pg/ml) than the HK-1 cells. At the light dose of 0.25-0.5 J/cm 2, Zn-BC-AM PDT-treated HK-1-EBV cells were found to produce a higher level of IL-1α and IL-1Β than the HK-1 cells. The production of IL-1Β appeared to be mediated via the IL-1Β-converting enzyme (ICE)-independent pathway. In contrast, the production of angiogenic IL-8 was downregulated in both HK-1 and HK-1-EBV cells after Zn-BC-AM PDT. Our results suggest that Zn-BC-AM PDT might indirectly reduce tumour growth through the modulation of cytokine production. © 2010 CSI and USTC. All rights reserved.

79956081336	Generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by a novel semiconductor catalyst	The objective of this study was to investigate antimicrobial mechanisms of a new catalytic material (charge transfer auto oxidation-reduction type catalyst, CT catalyst) that may have great potential for application in water/wastewater treatment. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacteria-free solution, induction of ROS and oxidative damage in bacteria (including E. coli and S. aureus) were examined for the CT catalyst. The results showed that significantly higher (p < 0.05, via t-test) amount of hydroxyl radicals was generated by the CT catalyst compared with the control, particularly after 6 h of contact time that more than twice of the amount of the control was produced. The generation of ROS in the bacteria was greater under higher pH and temperature levels, which closely related with the oxidative damage in cells. The results indicated that CT catalyst induced oxidative damage in the bacteria might serve as an important mechanism interpreting the anti-microbial function of the CT catalyst. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

They were designated as α-, β-, and γ-trichosanthin (TCS). All three trichosanthin isoforms exhibited similar biochemical activities, namely in vitro inhibition of protein synthesis, N-glycosidase activity on 28S rRNA, and conversion of supercoiled DNA to open-circular and linear DNA. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that their molecular weights were around 26 kDa. Amino acid composition analysis revealed that α-TCS, the major protein, corresponded closely to the previously reported trichosanthin. Protein fingerprinting analysis indicated that γ-TCS is structurally distinct from α-, and β-TCS while the latter two are very similar. The identity of γ-TCS was confirmed by N-terminal and internal protein sequencing. Cytotoxicity assay indicated that α-TCS is distinctively more toxic towards lymphocytes than β- and γ-TCS, while for fibroblast, β-TCS is the least toxic. Their difference in cytotoxicity in spite of their structural similar warrant further investigation into their structure and function relationship. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Intense level of GluR1, GluR2, GluR2/3 and GluR4 immunoreactivity was found in almost all neurons of the subthalamic nucleus. By double immunofluorescence, the subthalamic neurons in the same sections that displayed a strong immunoreactivity for GluR1 were found to display a robust GluR2 immunoreactivity and the subthalamic neurons that displayed GluR2 immunoreactivity were also found to express GluR4 immunoreactivity. The present results thus demonstrate that individual neurons of the subthalamic nucleus are likely to co-express GluR1 and GluR2, and GluR2 and GluR4 immunoreactivity. The native AMPA channels in the subthalamic neurons may, therefore, be composed of heteromeric subunits. The present results provide information of the neuroanatomical localization of AMPA receptor subunits in neurons of the subthalamic nucleus. The localization of AMPA receptor subunits may be related to functional characteristics of AMPA channels in the subthalamic neurons. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0036237169	Effects of dibutyryl cAMP on stanniocalcin and stanniocalcin-related protein mRNA expression in neuroblastoma cells	Stanniocalcin is a polypeptide hormone that was first reported in fish as a regulator of mineral metabolism. Its recent identification in mammals has opened a new area of investigation in basic and clinical endocrinology. In the present study, regulation of the stanniocalcin (STC) and stanniocalcin related protein (STCrP) genes were investigated in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2A) in relation to neuronal cell differentiation. Neuro-2A is an undifferentiated cell line that contains measurable levels of STCrP mRNA, but undetectable levels of STC mRNA. Treatment of the cells with either dbcAMP (1-4 mM) or 50 μM euxanthone (PW1) resulted in extensive differentiation and neurite outgrowth. However, only neurites of dbcAMP-treated cells developed varicosities, a phenotypic marker of axon formation. Furthermore, following differentiation induced by dbcAMP, there was an upregulation of STC and downregulation of STCrP mRNA levels. In the first 24 and 48 h of treatments, there was a maximum twofold induction and 1.5-fold reduction in STC and STCrP mRNAs respectively. Following 96 h of treatment, an additional 14-fold STC induction and 1.2-fold STCrP reduction were observed. The increase in STC mRNA levels was accompanied by a concomitant increase in axon-specific low molecular form microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2c) mRNA and varicosities on the neurites, suggesting a possible role for STC in axonogenesis. There was no induction of STC mRNA levels when PW1 was added into the culture media, whereas ionomycin (1-10 μM) had no observable effects on cell differentiation or STC/STCrP mRNA. Immunocytochemical staining of dbcAMP-treated cells revealed abundant levels of immunoreactive STC, particularly in the varicosities, with only weak staining in control, untreated cells. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides transfection studies indicated that the expression of STC was a cause of varicosity formation and a consequence of cell differentiation. Our findings lend further support to the notion that STC is involved in the process of neural differentiation.

80052042984	Two-photon induced luminescence, singlet oxygen generation, cellular uptake and photocytotoxic properties of amphiphilic Ru(ii) polypyridyl-porphyrin conjugates as potential bifunctional photodynamic therapeutic agents	Two Ru(ii) polypyridyl-porphyrin and Zn(ii) porphyrin conjugates (Ru-L and Ru-Zn-L) have been synthesized and their photophysical properties studied. The two conjugates, which contained a hydrophobic tetraphenylporphyrin L conjugated via an acetylide linker at its β-position with a hydrophilic Ru(ii) polypyridyl complex, showed high singlet oxygen quantum yields (>70%) and substantial two-photon absorption cross-sections (∼500 GM). Ru-L gave strong emissions at ∼660 and ∼733 nm through linear or two-photon excitation. Solvatochromism was observed in the fluorescence spectra of Ru-L and Ru-Zn-L, where in less polar solvents (i.e., toluene and dichloromethane) their fluorescence emissions became slightly blue-shifted with a 3-fold reduction in intensity relative to those observed in polar solvents (i.e., acetonitrile and methanol). Cell-based studies of these complex conjugates were conducted using human nasopharyngeal carcinoma HK-1 and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells on which Ru-L showed rapid cellular uptake, low dark-cytotoxicity, and high photo-cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Ru-L can be excited and emits in the "biological window" in vitro, making it a potential potent new generation photodynamic therapeutic agent capable of singlet oxygen generation and in vitro near-infrared emission. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The active component, ginsenosides have been shown to possess various pharmacological functions including immunomodulation and cardiovascular protection. Aim of the study: To investigate the immunomodulatory effect and anti-apoptotic effect of ginsenosides on avian influenza-infected human endothelial cells, and to present evidence for the cardiovascular protection by ginseng during influenza infection. Materials and methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were infected with avian influenza H9N2/G1 to induce IP-10 production and cell death, cells were then incubated with ginsenosides PPT and Re. The level of IP-10 and microRNA was determined by ELISA and real-time PCR respectively. Cell death was determined by MTT, TUNEL and flow cytometry. Results: Ginsenoside metabolite protopanaxatriol showed significant suppression effect on IP-10 production upon H9N2/G1 infection through up-regulation of miR-15b expression. In addition, ginsenoside-induced cytoprotection was reflected in the increase of cell viability. Data from flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL assay also showed that ginsenoside Re could protect ECs from H9N2/G1-induced apoptosis and DNA damage. Conclusions: This report further supports the traditional belief for immunomodulatory effects of ginseng, also demonstrated the partial protective mechanism of ginsenosides on avian influenza infection and its related endothelial dysfunction. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

82755186497	Effect of Benzo[a]pyrene on the production of vascular endothelial growth factor by human eosinophilic leukemia EoL-1 cells	Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) has been shown to affect both the development and response of T and B cells in the immune system. However, the effect of BaP on other immune cells, such as eosionophils, is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of BaP on the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using an in vitro eosinophilic EoL-1 cell and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) co-culture system. EoL-1-conditioned medium was found to promote the growth of HUVEC in a time-dependent manner. The growth stimulating activity was due to the production of VEGF by the EoL-1 cells. The production of VEGF was correlated with the enhanced expression of the phosphorylated form of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERKs) and the upregulated expression of VEGF mRNA. Furthermore, BaP-induced expression of VEGF mRNA was reduced by the ERK inhibitor PD98059. Results from this study suggested that BaP might affect the growth of endothelial cells through the modulation of VEGF production by eosinophils. © 2011 Begell House, Inc.

84355166629	Biological analysis of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in animal meats from the Pearl River Delta, China	Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) consist of a diverse group of industrial chemicals and pharmacological agents. The use of instrumental analyses as the first screening tool might not be cost-effective to identify the existence of enormous numbers of chemical contaminants in environments. Also, knowledge of the concentration of individual residues is difficult to use to evaluate biological impacts of contaminants to wildlife and humans. The primary objective of the present study was to develop and to test the feasibility of using a battery of exposure biomarkers for the rapid-screening of various endocrine disrupting activities present in food. The measurement of the EDC-elicited activities involved various (i) receptor-mediated responses, including androgenic, estrogenic, dioxin-like, glucocorticoid-like, progesterone-like, peroxisome proliferator-like and retinoid-like as well as (ii) the non-receptor mediated responses through modulation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP content. Samples of both local and imported pork, beef and chicken as well as freshwater and seawater fishes were collected. Extracts of different foods exhibited various dioxin-like and "hormonal" activities. Fish and chicken skin were found to be the major source of exogenous "hormonal" and dioxin-like substances in diets. Extracts of beef and pork contained lesser potencies of hormonally-active agents. Our data suggest that the proposed EDC-screening platform may be useful in a risk assessment for the routine monitoring of EDCs in foods. Continuous monitoring and research is warranted to assess the physiological consequences of the consufound to be the major source of exogenousmption.

84455163167	Cytoprotective effect of 20(S)-Rg3 on benzo[a]pyrene-induced DNA damage	Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ubiquitously existing in the environment. Its metabolites have been shown to cause DNA damage and cellular dysfunction in humans. Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer is a Chinese medicinal herb, and ginsenosides are the main active constituent of ginseng. Accumulating evidence had indicated that ginseng extract and ginsenosides possess cytoprotective effects. In this study, the protective effect of ginsenosides on BaP-induced DNA damage in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and HepG2 cells was investigated. The genotoxic effect of BaP was measured by the comet assay. Results showed that tail moment was increased in BaP-treated cells, but cotreatment of ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3 can significantly decrease BaP-induced DNA damage. A downstream mechanistic study revealed that 20(S)-Rg3 increased the gene expression of an important phase II detoxifying enzyme NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1. The effect was also associated with the activation of protein kinase B (Akt) and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). These results indicated that 20(S)-Rg3 might protect HDFs from BaP-induced DNA damage through the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. Our results also demonstrated that 20(S)-Rg3 is a functional ligand of pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that mediates the induction of drug clearance pathways. Subsequent knockdown of PXR expression by small interfering RNA confirmed the involvement of PXR on the protective effects of 20(S)-Rg3 against BaP-induced DNA damage. In summary, ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3 can protect against BaP-induced genotoxicity in human cells, suggesting that ginseng may serve as a natural cytoprotective agent against environmental carcinogens.

84856092388	An indirubin derivative, E804, exhibits potent angiosuppressive activity	Angiogenesis, the development of neovessels from pre-existing vessels, is obligatory for solid tumors survival, growth, invasion, and metastasis. Many anti-angiogenic agents are small molecules originated from natural sources. Recently, angiosuppressive effects of indirubin and its derivatives, the active components in indigo-producing herbs, have been shown to possess anti-viral and anti-inflammatory potentials. In this study, we identified another indirubin derivative, indirubin-3′-(2,3 dihydroxypropyl)-oximether (E804), could exhibit potent angiosuppressive effects. In vitro study showed that E804 could significantly inhibit human umbilical vein endothelial cells proliferation, migration, and tube formation in a concentration-dependent manner (0.4-40 μM); at the concentration of 1 μmol or above, angiosuppressive potency of E804 was found to be more significant than indirubin-3′-oxime. Using in vivo Matrigel plug model and directed-in vivo-angiogenesis-assay (DIVAA), E804 was shown more effective to attenuate the VEGF/bFGF-induced neovessel formation. The hemoglobin content and the invaded endothelial cells in the implants were also greatly reduced. Results from the aortic ring assay indicated E804 (4 μM) could completely suppress ex vivo sprouting of endothelial cells from the rat aorta fragments; with concomitant reduction of gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. E804 also concentration-dependently (0.04-10 μM) inhibited the subintestinal vessels formation in zebrafish embryos. This study provides the first evidence that E804, a novel indirubin derivative, could more effectively inhibit angiogenesis. With the improved anti-angiogenic potency when compared with indirubin-3′oxime, E804 would be a new potential candidate in the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84862973547	Highly selective mitochondria-targeting amphiphilic silicon(IV) phthalocyanines with axially ligated rhodamine B for photodynamic therapy	Two axially ligated rhodamine-Si(IV)-phthalocyanine (Rh-SiPc) conjugates, bearing one and two rhodamine B, were synthesized and their linear and two-photon photophysical, subcellular localization and photocytotoxic properties were studied. These Rh-SiPc conjugates exhibited an almost exclusive mitochondrial localizing property in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (HK-1) cells and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells. Strong photocytotoxic but low dark cytotoxic properties were also observed for the two Rh-SiPc conjugates toward the HK-1 cells. Using nuclei staining method and flow cytometric DNA content analysis, apoptotic cell death was induced by these conjugates upon photoactivation. This observation is consistent with their mitochondrial localization property. The observed properties of these conjugates qualify them as promising PDT agents. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84864119868	Ginsenoside Rb 1 induces type i collagen expression through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta	Wrinkle formation is one of the primary characteristics of skin aging, the major cause of wrinkle is the loss of structural protein type I collagen in dermal layer of skin. Topical application of natural substances to reduce wrinkle is gaining attention in recent years. Although a number of polyphenoic compounds are suggested to prevent ultraviolet-induced wrinkle, very few of them are able to increase type I collagen synthesis directly. Ginseng has been known in folk medicine of its beneficial effect to skin. The present study investigate the effect of ginsenoside on type I collagen induction in human dermal fibroblasts.

84865120957	Comparative studies of the cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and cytotoxic and phototoxic antitumor properties of ruthenium(II)-porphyrin conjugates with different linkers	Six water-soluble free-base porphyrin-Ru(II) conjugates, 1-3, and Zn(II) porphyrin-Ru(II) conjugates, 4-6, with different linkers between the hydrophobic porphyrin moiety and the hydrophilic Ru(II)-polypyridyl complex, have been synthesized. The linear and two-photon-induced photophysical properties of these conjugates were measured and evaluated for their potential application as dual in vitro imaging and photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) agents. Conjugates 1-3, with their high luminescence and singlet oxygen quantum yields, were selected for further study of their cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and cytotoxic and photocytotoxic (under linear and two-photon excitation) properties using HeLa cells. Conjugate 2, with its hydrophobic phenylethynyl linker, was shown to be highly promising for further development as a bifunctional probe for two-photon (NIR) induced PDT and in vitro imaging. Cellular uptake and subcellular localization properties were shown to be crucial to its PDT efficacy. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

0037032621	Anti-proliferative and differentiation-inducing activities of the green tea catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the human eosinophilic leukemia EoL-1 cell line	A novel approach for the treatment of leukemia is the differentiation therapy in which immature leukemia cells are induced to attain a mature phenotype when exposed to differentiation inducers, either alone or in combinations with other chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive drugs. Over the past decade, numerous studies indicated that green tea catechins (GTC) could suppress the growth and induce apoptosis on a number of human cancer cell lines. However, the differentiation-inducing activity of GTC on human tumors remains poorly understood. In the present study, the effect of the major GTC epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the proliferation and differentiation of a human eosinophilc leukemic cell line, EoL-1, was examined. Our results showed that EGCG suppressed the proliferation of the EoL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an estimated IC

84867743723	Role of STAT3/5 and Bcl-2/xL in 2-methoxyestradiol-induced endoreduplication of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells	2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), an endogenous metabolite of 17-β-estradiol, has been shown to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in various tumor models. We have previously shown that 2ME2 induced endoreduplication in a well-differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) HK-1 and a poorly differentiated C666-1 cell line. In the present study, we studied the survival factors involved in 2ME2-induced endoreduplicating NPC cells. In the HK-1 cells, knockdown of BcL-xL expression by siRNA resulted in the reduction of endoreduplication and an increase in the percentage of apoptosis. Further mechanistic study revealed that 2ME2 enhanced the expression of the phosphorylated form of STAT5 (p-STAT5-Y694), but not p-STAT3 (Y705) and p-STAT3 (S727), in the nucleus of HK-1 cells. Pre-treatment of cells with JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490 and STAT5 inhibitor resulted not only in the reduced expression of Bcl-xL, but also reduced the percentage of endoreduplicating cells. In contrast, 2ME2 enhanced the expression of p-STAT3 in the poorly differentiated C666-1 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 or Bcl-2/xL resulted in a decrease in endoreduplication of C666-1 cells. Taken together, the expression of p-STAT5 and p-STAT3 was upregulated in 2ME2-induced endoreduplicating HK-1 and C666-1 cells, respectively. Combination of 2ME2 with Bcl-2/xL inhibitor is a novel strategy to reduce the formation of endoreduplicating cells during chemotherapeutic treatment of NPC. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84878462367	Role of MIF/CXCL8/CXCR2 signaling in the growth of nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumor spheres	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and CXCL8 (also named IL-8) are strongly expressed in the tissues of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, their role in the growth of NPC has not been fully examined. This study aims to evaluate the functions of MIF and CXCL8 on the growth of NPC tumor spheres. The elevated expression of CXCL8 in tumor over normal tissues was confirmed in 37 pairs of biopsies from NPC patients. In the in vitro study, all the poorly differentiated NPC cell lines, including the EBV-positive C666-1, and the EBV-negative CNE-1, CNE-2, SUNE-1, HNE-1 and HONE-1 cells, were found to express CXCL8 and MIF. Therefore, the EBV-positive C666-1 cell was selected to examine for the role of MIF and CXCL8 in the growth of the NPC tumor spheres. Functional study showed that the growth of C666-1 tumor spheres, under the nutrient poor or growth factor supplemented culture conditions, could be inhibited by the CXCL8 specific peptide inhibitor. The growth of the tumor spheres could also be reduced by the CXCR2 specific inhibitor SB225002 or the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002, indicating that the endogenously produced CXCL8 plays an autocrine role in the growth of the tumor spheres. Further mechanistic studies revealed that the gene expression of CXCL8 could be reduced by the MIF specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or NF-κB inhibitor parthenolide, and the growth of tumor spheres was also reduced after MIF siRNA transfection. Taken together, the present study highlights the role of MIF/CXCL8/CXCR2 axis in the growth of NPC tumor spheres. Chemotherapeutic interference of this signaling pathway may help to control the growth of the NPC tumor. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84886739871	A novel Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 induces senescence in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and suppresses tumor formation	Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). AT13387 is a novel heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, which inhibits the chaperone function of Hsp90 and reduces expression of Hsp90-dependent client oncoproteins. This study aimed to evaluate both the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of AT13387 in the EBV-positive NPC cell line C666-1.Results: Our results showed that AT13387 inhibited C666-1 cell growth and induced cellular senescence with the downregulation of multiple Hsp90 client oncoproteins EGFR, AKT, CDK4, and restored the protein expression of negative cell cycle regulator p27. We also studied the ability of AT13387 to restore p27 expression by downregulation of AKT and the p27 ubiquitin mediator, Skp2, using AKT inhibitor and Skp2 siRNA. In the functional study, AT13387 inhibited cell migration with downregulation of a cell migration regulator, HDAC6, and increased the acetylation and stabilization of α-tubulin. We also examined the effect of AT13387 on putative cancer stem cells (CSC) by 3-D tumor sphere formation assay. AT13387 effectively reduced both the number and size of C666-1 tumor spheres with decreased expression of NPC CSC-like markers CD44 and SOX2. In the in vivo study, AT13387 significantly suppressed tumor formation in C666-1 NPC xenografts.Conclusion: AT13387 suppressed cell growth, cell migration, tumor sphere formation and induced cellular senescence on EBV-positive NPC cell line C666-1. Also, the antitumor effect of AT13387 was demonstrated in an in vivo model. This study provided experimental evidence for the preclinical value of using AT13387 as an effective antitumor agent in treatment of NPC. © 2013 Chan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0141450552	Identification of signal transduction pathways that modulate dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate activation of stanniocalcin gene expression in neuroblastoma cells	Stanniocalcin (STC) is a new mammalian polypeptide hormone and appears to be a regulator of neuronal function. We have already shown that the induction of STC mRNA and protein expression by cAMP is integral to neuroblastoma cell differentiation, particularly neurite outgrowth. In this study, we examined the cAMP pathway in greater detail. Some common neuritogenic agents, euxanthone (PW1) and trans-retinoic acid (RA), were studied for possible interactions with the dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP)-mediated response. Our results showed that STC mRNA induction by dbcAMP was mediated by protein kinase A-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) pathway, accompanied with phosphorylation of CREB and a reduction of p50, p65, and phosphorylated inhibitor κBα levels. Using a synthetic peptide nuclear factor-κB SN50, stimulation of dbcAMP-mediated STC expression was observed; indicating the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB might possibly repress STC expression. dbcAMP-induced STC mRNA expression was enhanced by PW1. In contrast, RA had highly suppressive effects. Cotreatment of cell with PW1 and cAMP provoked an increase in phosphorylated CREB (pCREB). Conversely, cotreatment with RA suppressed pCREB. The results highlighted the importance of phosphorylation of CREB in mediating STC gene expression. Taking a step further to dissect the possible regulatory pathways involved, with the aid of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or ionomycin, additive effects on STC gene expression were observed. The induction was aided by further elevation of pCREB, which was completely abolished by G5 6976, a Ca

0344255572	Inhibition of RANTES expression by indirubin in influenza virus-infected human bronchial epithelial cells	The human bronchial epithelial cells are the primary sites of influenza virus infection. In this study, the effect of indirubin on the expression of the chemokine regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) by the influenza virus-infected H292 human epithelial cell line was examined. The expression of RANTES mRNA was analyzed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the concentration of RANTES production was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At the non-cytotoxic concentrations, indirubin was found to reduce both the expression and production of RANTES in influenza A/NWS/33-infected H292 cells. Inhibition was also observed in influenza virus B/Lee-infected cells. Significant reduction of the expression of IL-8 was not observed after the infection. Indirubin-3′-oxime, a recently developed derivative with kinase inhibitory activity, also mediates a potent inhibitory effect on the expression of RANTES. The influenza virus infection-induced phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription NF-kB regulatory molecule IkBα and the p38 MAP kinase were also found to be inhibited by indirubin-3′-oxime. This finding suggests that indirubin is one of the components in the Chinese medicinal herbs Isatis indigotica and Strobilanthes cusia with immunomodulatory activity on the expression of RANTES. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

84892777102	Tryptanthrin inhibits angiogenesis by targeting the VEGFR2-mediated ERK1/2 signalling pathway	Angiogenesis is a key step for tumour growth and metastasis, and anti-angiogenesis has been proposed as an important strategy for cancer therapy. Tryptanthrin is a weakly basic alkaloid isolated from the dried roots of medicinal indigo plants and has been shown to possess anti-tumour activities on various cancer cell types. This study aims to investigate the in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenic activities of tryptanthrin and to unravel its underlying molecular action mechanisms. Our results show that tryptanthrin inhibited the in vitro proliferation, migration, and tube formation of the human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) in a concentration-dependent manner and significantly suppressed angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs in mice. Mechanistic studies indicated that tryptanthrin reduced the expression of several pro-angiogenic factors (Ang-1, PDGFB and MMP2). Tryptanthrin was also found to suppress the VEGFR2-mediated ERK1/2 signalling pathway in HMEC-1 cells and molecular docking simulation indicated that tryptanthrin could bound to the ATP-binding site of VEGFR2. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that tryptanthrin exhibited both in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenic activities by targeting the VEGFR2-mediated ERK1/2 signalling pathway and might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases. © 2013 Liao et al.

84898939549	Anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of indirubin derivatives in influenza A (H5N1) virus infected primary human peripheral blood-derived macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells	Human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) (H5N1) is associated with fulminant viral pneumonia and mortality rates in excess of 60%. Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) has been found to be the most severe form of acute lung injury caused by H5N1 virus infection while cytokine dysregulation and viral replication are thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. In this study, the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of two indirubin derivatives: indirubin-3′-oxime (IM) and E804 on primary human peripherial blood-derived macrophages and type-I like pneumocytes (human alveolar epithelial cells) during influenza A (H5N1) virus infection were investigated. We found that both of the indirubin derivatives strongly suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines including IP-10 (CXCL10), one of the key factors which contribute to the lung inflammation during H5N1 virus infection. In addition, we also demonstrated that the indirubin derivative delays the virus replication in the primary cell culture models. Our results showed that indirubin derivatives have a potential to be used as an adjunct to antiviral therapy for the treatment of severe human H5N1 disease. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84904440583	Monitoring and inhibition of Plk1: Amphiphilic porphyrin conjugated Plk1 specific peptides for its imaging and anti-tumor function	Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is well-known for taking part in cell cycle progression and regulation. Using small molecules for Plk inhibition has been well documented in the literature. However, there are several intrinsic and intractable problems associated with this approach. For example monitoring small molecule Plk inhibitors as anti-tumor agents in vitro/in vivo is often ineffective, they can have poor cell internalization and be susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Herein, we report the synthesis of cell-permeable, water-soluble amphiphilic porphyrin-Plk1 specific peptide bioconjugates, Por-P1 and Por-P2. In addition to resolving the aforementioned problems of the small molecule inhibitors Por-P2 manifests responsive emission enhancement upon binding with Plk1 in aqueous medium and in vitro, while potently triggering G2-M phase arrest and then apoptosis selectively in the cancer cells tested. In combination our findings make Por-P2 a promising candidate for the preparation of a new generation of smart chemotherapeutic targeting agents (imaging and inhibition) for Plk1 in particular cancer cell lines.

Specificity of the primers was confirmed in a cross-polymerase chain reaction (cross-PCR). IFN-α1, IFN-α1-9, IFN-α4, IFN-α6/8, IFN-α11, and IFN-αB were found to be induced in L929 cells 6-9 h after Poly(I)·Poly(C) treatment. The amplification of a particular subtype was not biased in the presence of excess of other templates. Differential expression of the IFN-α subtypes was observed in influenza A/NWS/33- and B/Lee/40-infected L929 cells. A/NWS/33 virus was found to upregulate the gene expression of IFN-α1, IFN-α4, IFN-α6/8, IFN-α11, and IFN-αB in L929 cells as early as 6 h after infection. In B/Lee/40-infected L929 cells, only IFN-α4 was upregulated. Our results suggest that the designed primers will serve as a useful tool in analyzing the expression of IFN-α subtypes in various systems and hence for the evaluation of their function. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
