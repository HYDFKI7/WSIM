0010726324	Effect of cold rolling reduction on recrystallization texture and drawability of a cold rolled Ti-IF steel sheet previously hot rolled in ferrite region	The influence of cold rolled reduction on the recrystallization texture and drawability of a Ti-IF steel, which was lubriciously hot rolled in unrecrystallized ferrite region, was investigated. When the hot band previously ferritic rolled, the annealed cold sheet acquired its highest r value by performed 73% cold reduction. However, as the hot band rolled in austenite region, it required about 90% cold reduction in order to achieve the same r value. Texture analysis showed that the hot bands of ferritic rolled Ti-IF steel have stronger {111} // ND texture component. The {111} // ND recrystallization texture was mostly intensified as the hot band cold rolled with 73% reduction and subsequently annealing, and the intensities of {110} // ND were weakened as performed more cold reduction.

0030137957	Effects of accelerated cooling on the mechanical properties of hot-rolled C-Mn steel	Three types of C-Mn steels (whose chemical compositions are: type-N 0.09%C, 0.8%Mn, 0.24%Si, 0.02%S, 0.025%P, and 0.09%V; type-H 0.201%C, 0.58%Mn, 0.2%Si, 0.019%S, and 0.024%P; type-Q 0.15%C, 0.5%Mn, 0.02%Si, 0.015%S, and 0.03%P) were hot rolled and acceleratingly cooled. It was found that the typical microstructure of acceleratingly cooled steels consists of polygonal ferrite, granular bainite, and little amount of upper bainite. This type of microstructure won't worsen the ductility of steel products, whereas the strengthening effect caused by Bainite transformation is much higher than the self-strengthening of each phase resulting from accelerated cooling hence it is the dominant mechanism for the strengthening.

0032268482	Influence of hot deformation on continuous cooling bainitic transformation in a low carbon steel	The influence of hot deformation conditions on continuous cooling bainitic transformation has been investigated for a low carbon microalloyed steel. The CCT diagrams show that deformation in unrecrystallized austenite region can accelerate transformation process. Bainitic transformation in intermediate transformation temperature region is prominent, and the proeutectoid polygonal ferrite transformation at elevated high temperature is suppressed. According to optical and TEM analyses, low carbon bainitic ferrite is characterized by granular and lathlike ferrite, based on the cooling rate and deformation conditions. For nondeformation, groups of coarse parallel ferrite lath form from the prior austenite grain boundaries with the same crystallographic orientation. For heavy deformation, cell structure within the austenite grains due to the high dislocation density formed, which provides more nucleation sites for bainite ferrite. So deformation can discontinue the growth of ferrite laths and decrease the length of ferrite laths.

24644440674	Developing an ultra-low carbon deep-drawing sheet steel by ferritic hot rolling process	How the processing conditions affect the properties especially the drawability of a ferritic hot-rolled and annealed Ti-IF sheet steel was investigated. With the sample workpieces lubricated during ferritic rolling and coiled at high temperature, the maximum plastic strain ratio of sample was 1.38 with elongation over 50%. For the samples rolled with lubricating interity further annealed, the strong {111} recrystallization texture presents uniform distribution in thickness direction with low of {110} recrystallization texture even in surface layer. However, under unlubricated rolling conditions, the weak {111} texture presents ununiform distribution with high intensity of {110} recrystallization texture especially in surface layer. To acquire the deep drawability, the reheating temperature, finished temperature and coiling temperature should be 1100-1150°C, 750-800°C and over 650°C, respectively.

2642512108	Influence of roll elastic deformation on gaugemeter equation for plate rolling	The error of gaugemeter equation decreases the gap setting precision. The precision of gaugemeter equation is strongly influenced by plate width, work roll radius, backup roll radius, work roll crown, backup roll crown and rolling force. And these influences are hard to measure. All these factors are converted to roll deflection deformation and roll flattening deformation for calculation. In order to calculate the deformation, the theory of influence function method was adopted. By using simulation program, the influence of these factors on deformation was obtained. Then a simple model can be built. With this model, it is convenient to analyze the influence of different factors on gaugemeter equation.

2942631385	The effect of delay time after hot rolling on the grain size of ferrite	It is necessary that the yield ratio (YR) of fire-resistant steel for construction is below 0.8. However, during the industrial production of fire-resistant steel, the rapid cooling rate of the laminar cooling configuration makes the ferrite grain become fine and increases the yield ratio (YR>0.8). In order to reduce the YR, by using Gleeble 1500 thermomechanical simulator the experiment of the effect of delay time after hot deformation on the grain size of ferrite was carried out. The results indicate that the hot deformation can increase the system free energy and the "ledges" generate at the grain boundary of deformed austenite, which leads to the increase of the ferrite nucleation rate and the refinement of ferrite grain. However, with the increase of delayed time, that the release of deformation energy and the reduction of "ledges" would decrease ferrite nucleation rate and increase the grain size of ferrite. Based on the experimental results, the technology to prolong the delay time after hot rolling is adopted in the industry production. The tested results indicate that the technology is effective to reduce the YR of fire-resistant steel and the YR decreases to 0.79 from initial 0.84.

2942689586	Roll wear prediction for plate mill	Discussing the existing empirical formulae of roll wear due to plate rolling, an on-line roll wear model based on regression analysis was studied utilizing the wear-out data acquired in situ. Based on the statistical wear-out distribution along roll barrel, the wearing value of a roll is considered as a function of roll length to predict the roll wear in next rolling period. Predictions by relevant model based on statistical regression analysis and measurement were both carried out for roll wear, with a roll taken from the 3500 mm plate mill in Shougang Steel Plant as specimen. The comparison shows that the predicted values fit with measured values well. The roll wear prediction model can improve significantly the precision of calculated values of roll wear obtained from empirical formula, this providing favorable controls of thickness precision, shape and crowning of plates.

3242707985	Effect of microcontent Nb in solution on the strength of low carbon steels	Two low carbon steels were hot rolled by thermo-mechanical process (TMCP), and one contains niobium (0.013%), and another does not contain niobium. By the comparison of tested results, it can be found that the yield strength of Nb steel is 55 MPa higher than that of Nb free steel on an average. In addition, the ferrite grain of Nb steel is finer than that of Nb free steel under the same finishing temperature, cooling rate, and final temperature. However, there are no Nb(C,N) particles to precipitate from austenite and ferrite by the observation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It can be concluded by theoretical analysis that both the increase of strength and the refinement of ferrite grain of Nb steel result from solid solution Nb atoms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

33748454672	Self-learning of gauge control model for plate rolling	According to the characteristics of plate rolling, a more reasonable mill spring model and rolling force model are developed for the reform project of 2 500 mm finishing mill in Nan Steel. Considering that the high precision of the mill spring model and its self-learning is independent of the rolling force model, the self-learning is implemented first in the mill spring model as modification. Then, the workpiece gauge at exit is computed by the modified mill spring model used to implement the self-learning in the rolling force model where the short-term self-learning is used to correct the workpiece hardness coefficients of different batches, whereas the long-term one is to correct those of different steel grades. In this way, the cumulative results of short-term self-learning become the data source for subsequent computation. The method are kept and listed in database for subsequent computation. The method proposed was applied to the Medium Plate Mill Nan Steel, by which the hit rate of plate gauge control was increased by 13.3%.

The main components at surface before annealing were {110}<001> orientation, which transformed to {001}<110> after annealing. While at the mid-section and 1/4-section, weak <111>//ND (normal direction) texture and strong <110>//RD (rolling direction) texture focused on {001}<110> orientation was formed before annealing, but {001}<110> orientation transformed to {111}<112> transformation and only <111>//ND recrystallization texture existed after annealing.

33750928585	Texture comparison of an ordinary IF steel and a high-strength IF steel under ferritic rolling and high-temperature coiling	The present work was performed to investigate the texture difference of an ordinary Ti-IF steel and a high-strength Ti-IF steel under ferritic hot rolling and high-temperature coiling. Comparing with the completely recrystallized textures of the ordinary IF steel, the textures of the high-strength IF steel were still deformed textures. The texture difference for the two steels is related to high P content in the high-strength IF steel which prevents the recrystallization during the coiling process. For the ordinary IF steel, the texture components were mainly very weak {001}〈110〉 orientation at the surface, and partial 〈110〉//RD (rolling direction) textures focused on {223}〈110〉 orientation and 〈111〉/ND (normal direction) texture at the mid-section and 1/4-section. For the high-strength IF steel, the texture components were mainly of {110}〈001〉 orientation at the surface and of a sharp 〈110〉//RD texture from {001}〈110〉 to {223}〈110〉 and weak 〈111〉/ND texture at the mid-section and 1/4-section. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33846585656	Effect of ferritic hot rolling schedule on texture and deep drawability of Ti-IF steel	The properties after annealing and texture of a Ti-IF steel were investigated after different hot rolling reductions in ferrite region at different finished rolling temperatures. The results showed that the IF steel has better deep drawability, higher mechanical and texture strength and elongation if the hot rolling temperature was low with big reduction in ferrite region. The texture of cold rolled IF steel is the typical conventional cold texture, i.e., partial <110>//RD fibers and global <111>//ND fibers. After annealing for recrystallization, the strength of <110>//RD fibers decreases greatly and then transform into <111>//ND recrystallized fibers. Therefore, the texture strength of <111>//ND increases greatly. It was proved that among all the cold rolled specimens, the one hot rolled finally at 750°C. with total reduction of 80% has the highest strength of <111>//ND recrystallized fibers.

It was found that texture evolution at high temperature coiling is absolutely different from that at low temperature one. The hot band texture includes a strong α-fiber as well as a weak γ-fiber after ferritic hot rolling and low temperature coiling. Both of them intensify after cold rolling and a γ-fiber with peak at {111}< 112> is the main texture of annealed samples. However, the main component of the hot band texture after high temperature coiling is γ-fiber. After cold rolling, the intensity of γ texture reduces; α fiber (except {111} <110> component) intensifies and a strong and well-proportioned γ-fiber forms in the annealed samples.

34547101452	Gauge-meter model building based on the effect of elastic deformation of rolls in a plate mill	Abstract: The calculation error of the gauge-meter model will affect the gap setting precision and the self-learn precision of rolling force. The precision of the gauge-meter model is strongly influenced by plate width, working roll radius, backup roll radius, working roll crown, backup roll crown, and rolling force. The influence rules are hard to get by measuring. Taking a conventional 4-h plate mill as the research subject, these influences were transferred into the calculation of roll deflection and flattening deformation. To calculate these deformations, the theory of the influence function method was adopted. By modifying the traditional gauge-meter model, a novel model of the effect of roll elastic deformation on the gap setting was built by data fitting. By this model, it was convenient to analyze the variation caused by the rolling condition. Combining the elastic deformation model of rolls with the kiss-rolls method, a gauge-meter model was put forward for plate thickness prediction. The prediction precision of thickness was greatly improved by the new gauge-meter model. © 2007 University of Science and Technology Beijing.

The r-value increases with the decrease of reheating temperature, and finish rolling temperature and the increase of reductions in ferritic region. For lubricated ferritic rolling and annealing, the r-value is raised up to 1.75, and elongation rate is over 50% at the finish rolling temperature of 650 °C, which is suitable for DDQ grade products. However, the r-value is below 1.0 in the case of unlubricated rolling. The X-ray diffraction was used to analyze the textural characteristic of samples. For samples subjected to lubricated rolling and annealing, the strong {111} // ND recrystallization texture is distributed homogeneously along the thickness direction, and the intensity of {110} recrystallization texture is very low even in surface. However, for unlubricated samples, the {111} texture is distributed inhomogeneously and is weak along the thickness direction, and {110} // ND recrystallization texture is strong, which deteriorates the formability. © 2006 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.

The hot band texture of ELC includes not only strong α-fiber but weak γ-fiber, while that of IF is mainly the γ-fiber. However, after cold rolling and annealing, ELC presents mainly the γ-fiber texture with peak at {111} <112> , and IF presents the strong and well-proportioned γ-fiber texture which provides obviously higher strength than ELC. Moreover, the values of mean plastic strain ratio and percentage elongation of IF are 0.6 and 5% higher than ELC, respectively, with higher tensile strength and lower yield strength provided.

Microstructural characterization indicated that grain refinement and precipitation hardening were the primary reasons for the increase in strength. Ultrafast cooling increased the density of dislocations and refined the grain size. Average size of precipitates containing Ti and Mo was 3-6 nm by ultrafast cooling process, while average precipitate size obtained by accelerated cooling process was 6-9 nm.

It is found that texture characteristic at the surface is absolutely different from that at the mid-section in ferritic rolling as well as in cold rolling and annealing. Shear texture {110} <001> dominates at the surface; {110} <001> and {001} <110>-{223} <110> are the main components at the mid-section after hot rolling.

Texture change at the surface shows some differences from conventional results during annealing.

70349251857	Precipitation in low carbon steel microalloyed with Nb for automotive wheel	Carbonitride precipitation behavior of Nb microalloyed steel during holding at high temperature and low temperature was studied through thermal simulation. The results show that in high temperature region incubation period is necessary for strain induced NbC precipitation, and increasing the holding temperature leads to an increase of precipitation. Simple precipitation changes to complex precipitation when holding for 300 s at high temperature. Meanwhile, complex precipitation converges and grows, the amount of precipitation decreases and the shape of precipitation changes with the increasing of holding temperature. In low temperature region, the amount of precipitation goes higher appreciably with holding temperature and time. The size of precipitation increases little with increasing holding time.

And the ultra fast cooling technology has been successfully applied to the plate rolling production in Shouqin Metal Materials Co. Ltd. Industrial trials are reported for the production of X70 pipeline steels (about 70000 t) under UFC conditions. Pipeline steels with reasonably good properties have been produced on an industrial scale. UFC can improve the temperature uniformity, the mechanical properties and the plate profile of X70 pipeline steel. The performance features of the trial plates can meet the standard of X70 pipeline steel. Spot test results have shown that the qualification rate of shape control, the performance and charpy impact properties for the trial plates are 95%, 97% and 98%, respectively. The impact values of X70 pipeline steel at UFC mode exceed the standard requirements of X80 pipeline steel. The productivity is enhanced because cutting quantity of head and tail of the plate is reduced. The enhancement of control accuracy of the red back temperatures is favorable for industrial production of X70 pipeline steel.

HSLA steel should possess not only enough strength and hardness but also excellent toughness and forming property in order to make the machine large scale, lightweight and high parameter. And in recent years, with the new modern plate heat treatment lines pulling into production, the production conditions of high-strength steel plates have been improved significantly, and the development of HSLA steel has attracted more and more attentions.

84879728016	Effects of Tempering Temperature and Mo/Ni on Microstructures and Properties of Lath Martensitic Wear-Resistant Steels	The tempering behavior was experimentally studied in lath martensitic wear-resistant steels with various Mo/Ni contents after tempering at different temperatures from 200 to 600 °C. It is shown that a good combination of hardness (HV) (420 - 450) and - 20 °C impact toughness (38 - 70 J) can be obtained after quenching and tempering at 200 - 250 °C. The microstructure at this temperature is lath structure with rod-like and/or flake-like e-carbide with about 10 nm in width and 100 nm in length in the matrix, and the fracture mechanism is quasi-cleavage fracture combining with ductile fracture. Tempering at temperature from 300 to 400 °C results in the primary quasi-cleavage fracture due to the carbide transformation from resolved retained austenite and impurity segregation between laths or blocks. However, when the tempering temperature is higher than 500 °C, the hardness (HV) is lower than 330 and the fracture mechanism changes to ductile fracture due to the spheroidization and coarsening of cementite. Additions of Mo and Ni have no significant effects on the carbides morphologies at low tempering temperatures, but improve the resistance to softening and embrittling for steels when tempered at above 350 °C. © 2013 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.

The study demonstrates that Ti and Mo carbides precipitate during austenite-to-ferrite, austenite-to-bainite and even during austenite-to-martensite transformations, contributing to precipitation strengthening. Four different types of precipitates in the size range of 3-200 nm were observed during the transformation. They are spherical (Ti,Mo)C and TiC, cuboidal (Ti,Mo)(C,N) and long thin strips of FexC. The size of the precipitates was large and the density was less during austenite transformation. However, the size decreased and density increased during the austenite-to-bainitic ferrite transformation. During the austenite-to-martensite transformation, a high density of fine and spherical-shaped precipitates comprising of Ti and Mo in the range of 3-10 nm were observed. © 2013 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

10644294023	Application of crown-flatness vector analysis in plate rolling schedule	A simple plate crown model was introduced, and the crown-flatness vector analysis method was analyzed. Based on the plate rolling technology, the rolling schedule design of e-longation phase is divided into three steps. First step is to calculate the reductions of first pass of elongation making full use of the mill capability to decrease the total pass number. The second step is to calculate the pass reduction for the last three or four passes to control crown and flatness by crown-flatness vector analysis method. In the third step, the maximum rolling force limit and the total pass number are adjusted to make the plate gauge at exit equal to target gauge with satisfactory flatness. The on-line application shows that this method is effective.

84921962390	Case-based reasoning (CBR) model for ultra-fast cooling in plate mill	New generation thermo-mechanical control process (TMCP) based on ultra-fast cooling is being widely adopted in plate mill to product high-performance steel material at low cost. Ultra-fast cooling system is complex because of optimizing the temperature control error generated by heat transfer mathematical model and process parameters. In order to simplify the system and improve the temperature control precision in ultra-fast cooling process, several existing models of case-based reasoning (CBR) model are reviewed. Combining with ultra-fast cooling process, a developed R5 CBR model is proposed, which mainly improves the case representation, similarity relation and retrieval module. Certainty factor is defined in semantics memory unit of plate case which provides not only internal data reliability but also product performance reliability. Similarity relation is improved by defined power index similarity membership function. Retrieval process is simplified and retrieval efficiency is improved apparently by windmill retrieval algorithm. The proposed CBR model is used for predicting the case of cooling strategy and its capability is superior to traditional process model. In order to perform comprehensive investigations on ultra-fast cooling process, different steel plates are considered for the experiment. The validation experiment and industrial production of proposed CBR model are carried out, which demonstrated that finish cooling temperature (FCT) error is controlled within ±25℃ and quality rate of product is more than 97%. The proposed CBR model can simplify ultra-fast cooling system and give quality performance for steel product.
