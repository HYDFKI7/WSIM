15744388244	Novel modeling method for grey RBF neural network and its application	A novel neural network called grey radial basis function network (GRBFN) is proposed. The reasons why grey theory is introduced into the RBF neural network are based on two facts. First, the modeling performance will be affected by the randomness inherent in the data when neural network approach is used for the model. That is, poor performance results from great randomness, and vice versa. Second, grey accumulated generating operation (AGO), a basis of the grey theory is effective to reduce randomness. Because of these facts, the GRBFN model is presented and expected to have a better modeling precision of random drift in dynamically tuned gyroscope (DTG). The novel grey RBF network is applied to drift modeling of DTG. The numerical results of real drift data from a certain type of DTG prove the effectiveness of the proposed GRBFN model successfully. The RBF neural network modeling approach is also investigated to provide a comparison with the GRBFN model. Under the identical training condition, the GRBFN's training speed is enhanced greatly.

14744297131	Design and simulation of OAS/INS/GPS/APS integrated navigation system	It is presented the development of an integrated navigation system for an under water vessels using three new navigation sub-systems to integrate with inertial navigation system (INS). The three sub-systems are GPS altitude determination system, acoustic positioning system (APS) and optical alignment system (OAS), each offering high accuracy in different conditions with different working principles and features. Integration of GPS, INS, APS and OAS would fuse together the virtues of each system for a better performance. Thus the federated Kalman filter (FKF) algorithm is employed in this integrated system, which is based on two reasons. The first one is that there are more than two navigation sub-systems involved, using FKF could overcome the disadvantages of the traditional centralized Kalman filter (CKF), which is suffer from dimension disaster, lower real-time capability and worse robustness. The second one is that the integrated system has different integrated modes in different working conditions. For example, it employs INS/GPS integrated mode mostly when the vessel navigates surface, and uses INS/APS or only INS mode when it sails underwater. When the vessel is surface near the shore, the integrated system takes OAS/INS/GPS integrated mode. Hence, different integrated methods are decided by different kinds of sub-system's signal acquired. Using FKF can simply detect the valid system and select an optimal mode to accomplish optimal parameter calculation, and to decrease the complexity of system mode and algorithm. Numerical results prove that the integrated navigation system is capable of providing higher accuracy both in location and in azimuth.

19944388556	Novel grey-based modeling strategy for a dynamically tuned gyroscope random drift model	In order to reduce the drift modeling error of gyroscopes, the drift characteristics of gyroscopes were analyzed and the drift error is one of the main factors that determines the performance of inertia navigation system. Thus processing the drift data of gyroscopes is significant. Based on the analysis of the existing methods, this paper addressed a grey-based model for reducing the modeling error of drift data for a dynamically tuned gyroscope (DTG). Wavelet transform (WT) is integrated into the grey model to enhance modeling capability of the GM (1,1), which is a single variable first-order grey model. The raw DTG drift data are preprocessed by the WT to eliminate disturbing impactive noises. The post-processed data are then used to construct the grey model. The numerical results from measured drift data of a DTG demonstrate that the hybrid strategy can reduce the drift model error and improve the model accuracy. And the modeling performance of the hybrid model is quite satisfactory.

The storage reliability is as important as the working reliability. In order to know the characteristics of weapon's inertial device and to provide the information for prolonging its using period and maintenance, it is necessary to estimate and predict the storage performance reliability. A modeling approach for grey Markov chain prediction was discussed. And the method possesses the advantages of grey model and Markov chain model. It makes good use of dynamic modeling idea of grey model to predict the general trend of original reliability data. Then according to the trend, the states are divided so that it can overcome the disadvantage of large volume calculation of state transition probability matrix in Markov chain. Moreover, the approach expands the applied scope of grey model and makes it fit for forecasting of random data with bigger fluctuation. Finally, the storage performance reliability of the rate gyroscope for some missile was estimated and forecasted by using the hybrid grey Markov chain.

23044477828	Multisensor fusion for an experimental airship based on strong tracking filter	To improve the independent ability of attitude determination and positioning for an unmanned experimental airship platform, a micro inertial measurement system (MIMS) is expected to integrate with the existing system, which incorporates a digital magnetic compass and a differential pseudorange GPS receiver. The navigation error of the low-precision MIMS will be calibrated using nondrift DGPS receiver and magnetic compass. This paper proposes an adaptive strong tracking filter to perform multisensor fusion to assure state-error estimation of convergence under some uncertain conditions. These uncertainties include model simplification, unknown microsensor stochastic characteristics, a large-scale initial filtering parameter variation, and state sudden change. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the filter has strong robustness to all the uncertainties mentioned above. By this filtering approach, the navigation errors of MIMS are limited to a certain range. Accordingly, the whole integrated measurement system will respond to dynamics, and its automotive navigation ability is also enhanced.

Compared with the EKF, the UKF has the characteristics of easier realization and higher state estimation accuracy.

Simulation results show that the UKF is superior to the EKF and is an ideal nonlinear filtering method in the land vehicle DR navigation.

This paper proposes a neuro-fuzzy approach to control the uncertain dynamics and disturbance. The flexible model of solar array is extended to the satellite attitude equation. To overcome the variation of internal parameters and external disturbances, three adaptive neuro-fuzzy controllers are applied to realize the attitude and orbit control system (AOCS) on the base of Proportional-Integral- Differential (PID) controllers. A least square estimation method is combined with gradient descent learning in order to optimize the learning error universally during train procedure. Simulation results show the neuro-fuzzy controllers have good performance to abate influence from disturbance, fadeless vibration and the change of the satellite's inertia parameters.

24144436920	Particle filter for sensor fusion in a land vehicle navigation system	Generally, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used for sensor fusion in a land vehicle navigation system. However, defects of the first-order linearization of the nonlinear model in the EKF can introduce large estimated errors, and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In order to yield higher accuracy of navigation, in this paper, a novel particle filter (PF) for sensor fusion is proposed and the sampling importance resampling particle filter (SIR-PF) is applied to address the nonlinear measurement model and it shows better performances when compared with the EKF.

25644448116	Study on GPS attitude determination system aided INS using adaptive Kalman filter	A marine INS/GPS (inertial navigation system/global positioning system) adaptive navigation system is presented in this paper. The GPS with two antennae providing vessel attitude is selected as the auxiliary system to fuse with INS. The Kalman filter is the most frequently used algorithm in the integrated navigation system, which is capable of estimating INS errors online based on the measured errors between INS and GPS. The conventional Kalman filter (CKF) assumes that the statistics of the noise of each sensor are given. As long as the noise distributions do not change, the Kalman filter will give the optimal estimation. However, the GPS receiver will be disturbed easily and thus temporally changing measurement noise will join into the outputs of GPS, which will lead to performance degradation of the Kalman filter. Many researchers introduce a fuzzy logic control method into innovation-based adaptive estimation Kalman filtering (IAE-AKF) algorithm, and accordingly propose various adaptive Kalman filters. However, how to design the fuzzy logic controller is a very complicated problem, which is still without a convincing solution. A novel IAE-AKF is proposed herein, which is based on the maximum likelihood criterion for the proper computation of the filter innovation covariance and hence of the filter gain. The approach is direct and simple without having to establish fuzzy inference rules. After having deduced the proposed IAE-AKF algorithm theoretically in detail, the approach is tested in the developed INS/GPS integrated marine navigation system. Real field test results show that the adaptive Kalman filter outperforms the CKF with higher accuracy and robustness. It is demonstrated that this proposed approach is a valid solution for the unknown changing measurement noise existing in the Kalman filter. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Mean-while, as some states can not be estimated or have poor estimation, the simplified state equation employed in the alignment process will cause model parameter uncertainty. A multiple-model estimator was used to solve the problem of uncertainty, and the alignment accuracy was improved remarkably. The simulation results show that the multiple-model estimator is effective in initial alignment for SINS on a stationary base.

The DTG original drift data are preprocessed by the WT such that the disturbing impactive noises of drift data can be removed. The post-processing data are then used to construct the grey model. Due to the inherent error between the modelling values and actual outputs, the grey model is further compensated by the linear regression method.

27844486029	Modeling the random drift of micro-machined gyroscope with neural network	In this paper a new combined method was applied to model the random drift of a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) gyro to enhance its performance. The gyro is used to set up a micro-inertial -measurement unit (MIMU) for its low cost, low power consumption and small dimensions. To improve the MIMU's performance, we model the gyro's random drift by a statistic method. Given the paucity of the knowledge of fabrication of the gyro, we select a neural network model instead of making a delicate physical-mathematical model. Since the gyro we used is a tuning fork micro-machined sensor with large random drift, the modeling performance is affected by the randomness inherent in the output data when neural network approach is applied. Therefore, radial basis network structure, which was successfully applied to model temperature drift of fiber optical gyros, was chosen to build the model and the grey neural network. Compared with autoregressive model, the standard error of the gyro's random drift is reduced dramatically by radial basis model and grey radial basis model. © Springer 2005.

33751564980	New fine damping method for solid ESG rotor	For the electrostatically suspended gyro (ESG) with solid rotor, because the equatorial photoelectric sensor won't sense the equatorial marking line and output the correct damping control information when the nutation angle is small, the active damping with equatorial marking line will bring considerable error. The passive damping method by applying strong DC magnetic field requires too much time. So an active damping method by longitude marking lines is proposed to fulfill the fine damping for solid ESG rotor. The shape of rotor marking lines and the principle of fine damping are introduced. The simulation results prove that this fine damping method can effectively solve the problem of damping error introduced by active damping with equatorial marking line. The estimating results for damping time indicate that the fine damping time is less than 10 percent of passive damping time.

33845350874	Joint tracking algorithm using particle filter and mean shift with target model updating	Roughly, visual tracking algorithms can be divided into two main classes: deterministic tracking and stochastic tracking. Mean shift and particle filter are their typical representatives, respectively. Recently, a hybrid tracker, seamlessly integrating the respective advantages of mean shift and particle filter (MSPF) has achieved impressive success in robust tracking. The pivot of MSPF is to sample fewer particles using particle filter and then those particles are shifted to their respective local maximum of target searching space by mean shift. MSPF not only can greatly reduce the number of particles that particle filter required, but can remedy the deficiency of mean shift. Unfortunately, due to its inherent principle, MSPF is restricted to those applications with little changes of the target model. To make MSPF more flexible and robust, an adaptive target model is extended to MSPF in this paper. Experimental results show that MSPF with target model updating can robustly track the target through the whole sequences regardless of the change of target model.

33846058346	Head tracking based on the integration of two different particle filters	Existing methods of improving particle filters mainly focus on two aspects: designing a good proposal distribution before sampling and allocating particles to a high posterior area after sampling. An auxiliary particle filter (APF) is one such simple algorithm belonging to the former aspect, which generates particles from an importance distribution depending on a more recent observation. Its weakness is that it requires a large number of particles. On the other hand, a kernel-based particle filter (KPF), which belongs to the latter aspect, is able to greatly reduce the number of particles required and is still able to capture good characteristics of the posterior density. However, a KPF does not take the current observation into account. To utilize their respective strengths, a new algorithm is proposed in this paper with the combination of an APF and a KPF, the APF for designing good proposal density and the KPF for exploring the dominant mode of the posterior density. Experimental results in several real-tracking scenarios demonstrate that the integrated algorithm surpasses the standard particle filter (SPF) when encountering weak dynamic models. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is also able to achieve a comparable performance with KPF whilst reducing computational cost. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The head's colour and shape are chosen manually as prototypes, when the first frame becomes available. Then estimations of the head's position are made in the following frame. After that, probabilistic neural networks (PNN) are used to classify these estimations into two categories: head and background. Estimations belonging to the first category are then put through a competitive layer. The winner is then regarded as the optimal estimate for the position of the head in that frame. The tracking involves finding the optimal position frame by frame. A simple data fusion algorithm is also applied to improve the performance of neural networks.

Applying the energy method, this paper derives a formula for this torque, then shows results of calculations and simulations. On this basis, it discusses the influence of an off-center axis on the precision of gyroscopes. The results indicate that electrostatic torques are a function of the electric potentials on the electrodes and the location of the rotor's axis of rotation with respect to the gyro case. In high precision applications it is necessary for the gyroscope's rotor to be at the zero-torque location. The results are valuable for MUM reading ESGs as well as those that are optical reading.

Comparing with proportional integral derivative (PID) control, IMC has only a parameter, and has better performance. As a result, IMC solves nonlinearity error well in ESS with only one uncertain parameter, and performs well when the rotor has large displacement.

34547989729	Direct compensative robust optimal control (DCROC) law for ship straight-line track-keeping	A linear quadratic optimal direct track-keeping control law was proposed based on first-order Nomoto nominal model. Furthermore, based on Lyapunov stabilized theory, considering parametric uncertainty from variations of ship speed and disturbances uncertain from wind, wave and sea current, a direct compensative robust optimal control (DCROC) law was developed. It can guarantee closed-loop system globally and uniformly converge to a remained set. High accuracy and robustness were achieved. By introducing some nonlinear blocks, closed-loop system achieves global and uniform asymptotical stableness. Numerical simulations on a Mariner Class ship are presented to validate the control law.

34547996124	Research on the electrostatic torques in the MUM-ESG	A research on the electrostatic torques in the electrostatically suspended gyroscope (ESG) that uses the mass-unbalance modulation (MUM) scheme (MUM-ESG) to sense the direction of the rotor's spinning axis is presented here. Spherical harmonic functions are used to describe the asphericity of the rotor and the electrodes. Rotational matrix theory in quantum mechanics is utilized to transform the description of the rotor's asphericity from the rotor-fixed frame into the cavity-fixed frame. And the principle of the virtual displacement is applied to find out the electrostatic torques acting on the rotor. Analytical expressions of the electrostatic torques indicate that there are only three kinds of factors need to be considered when looking for the electrostatic torques in the MUM-ESG. The factors are the asphericity of the rotor, the eccentric rotation of the rotor, and the coupling between the rotor's translational displacement and asphericity. An intuitionistic explanation for the electrostatic torque that comes of the rotor's eccentric rotation is presented also. The effects of these conclusions should be tested and verified in the future experiments and applications.

34548663331	A novel conflict reassignment method based on grey relational analysis (GRA)	In the framework of evidence theory, data fusion is to build a single belief function by combining several belief functions derived from distinct information sources. Dempster's rule of combination, a classical combination rule with several interesting mathematical properties, is widely employed. However, as an inherent problem, Dempster's rule of combination is incapable of managing the existing conflicts from various information sources at the step of normalization. The conflict management becomes an important problem in the operation of combination, especially in the condition of highly conflicting, which leads to produce the illogical result of combination. In this paper, we introduce the idea of grey relational analysis (GRA), and propose a new conflict reassignment approach of belief functions, as a preprocessing method, to automatically identify and reassign the conflicts on belief functions before combination. Three numerical examples are employed and implemented. Through analysis and comparison of the combined results, of the existing alternatives, the proposed approach not only can flexibly solve the problem of conflict management with better convergence performance, but also can automatically evaluate the reliability of the information sources and distinguish the unreliable information. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

36448993003	A novel adaptive filter mechanism for improving the measurement accuracy of the fiber optic gyroscope in the maneuvering case	Although much work on modelling the drift of fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) in the quiescent case has been done, little attention is paid to eliminate the influence of the uncertain gyroscope drift in the maneuvering case. In this paper, a novel adaptive mechanism based on double transitive factors is highlighted, which is implemented in two stages. In the first stage one adaptive factor is investigated, and then the productions of the stage, the suboptimal estimated state vector and its suboptimal covariance matrix are passed to the second stage, where the other adaptive factor is derived, and then the modified covariance matrix of measurement noise is passed to the first stage; consequently the optimal estimation may be achieved based on the recursive mechanism. As demonstrated in the testing of a specific type of FOG, the proposed method, compared with the other scheme in this paper, greatly reduces the influence of insufficient kinematic model and stochastic error, thus improving the measurement accuracy of FOG in the maneuvering case. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.

36049041417	Efficient hybrid appearance model for object tracking with occlusion handling	During object tracking, the appearance of the object being tracked ol can suffers from complex variations due to large illumination, pose changes, and frequent occlusions. Modeling a robust appearance model for accommodating those variations becomes a crux for appearance-based tracking algorithms. We present a tracking algorithm based on the hybrid appearance models that include a fixed appearance model, a fast-change appearance model, and an eigenspace-based model. The hybrid appearance models reveal three factors of appearance changes: stable, transient, and gradual. A particle filter is invoked to perform state inference and simultaneously be responsible for inter-model switching. In addition, robust statistics is utilized to deal with occlusion events. Numerous experiments on many difficult sequences demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively track the object undergoing large pose, lighting, and viewpoint changes. More importantly, our algorithm shows powerful ability of addressing severe occlusions. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

36749048155	Robust appearance-guided particle filter for object tracking with occlusion analysis	A major challenge for most tracking algorithms is how to address the changes of object appearance during tracking, incurred by large illumination, scale, pose variations and occlusions. Without any adaptability to these variations, the tracker may fail. In contrast, if adapts too fast, the appearance model is likely to absorb some improper part of the background or occluding objects. In this paper, we explore a tracking algorithm based on the robust appearance model which can account for slow or rapid changes of object appearance. Specifically, each pixel in appearance model is represented using mixture Gaussian models whose parameters are on-line learned by sequential kernel density approximation. The appearance model is then embedded into particle filter framework. In addition, an occlusion handling scheme is invoked to explicitly indicate outlier pixels and deal with occlusion events, thus avoiding the appearance model to be contaminated by undesirable outlier 'thing'. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our appearance-based tracking algorithm can successfully track the object in the presence of dramatic appearance changes, cluttered background and even severe occlusions. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

A new fault diagnosis strategy based on the statistical parameter analysis (SPA) and support vector machine (SVM) classification model was proposed for dynamically tuned gyroscopes (DTG).

To escape the 'cheat' of the local optimization and alleviate the burden of computing, simulated tempering annealing (STA) was adopted. An experiment was designed to smooth and estimate simultaneously one unweighted and six different gradients weighted images. The results of the experiment verify the utility of the mentioned method by the greatly decreased noise effect and the ensured positive semi-definite characteristics of the tensor field even if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is very low. Compared with the traditional SA method, the method adopted can more efficiently decrease the noise effect and the computing burden.

The model was composed of the autoregression part and the polynomial distributed lag (PDL) part. The former represented the effect on FOG's current output by its own lags, while the latter described FOG's drift caused by temperature variation. Due to the linear character of the model, its coefficients were obtained by using least-square estimation method. In the testing, two FOGs' field temperature drift data sets were collected to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the linear multi-variable model is effective, and the FOGs' accuracy may be improved by more than 50% after compensation.

63349098101	De-noising fractional noise in fiber optic gyroscopes based on lifting wavelet	The output of fiber optic gyroscopes (FOG) involves Gaussian white noise and fractional noise which is difficult to eliminate by traditional methods because of the non-stationary, long-term correlation, self-similarity characteristics. On account of the characteristics of the wavelet multi-resolution analysis, wavelet analysis has become a powerful tool to study fractal noises. This paper introduces an effective technique for the de-noising of FOG corrupted by non-stationary noises. The proposed method is based on a second generation wavelet transform and level-dependent threshold estimator. The whole algorithm consists of the de-composition based on lifting wavelet, parameter estimation, and level-dependent soft threshold de-noising. The de-noising method based on traditional universal thresholding wavelet is also investigated to provide a comparison with the new method. Experimental results prove that the proposed method based on level-dependent lifting wavelet outperforms the traditional wavelet de-noising method.

In the proposed method, the pedestrian is equipped with a prototype wearable sensor module to record accelerations and determine the headings while walking. To improve the step detection accuracy, different types of activities are classified according to extracted features by means of a probabilistic neural network (PNN). The vertical acceleration data, which indicate the periodic vibration during gait cycle are filtered through a wavelet transform before being used to count the steps and assess the step length from which the distance traveled is estimated. By coupling the distance with the azimuth, navigation through pedestrian dead reckoning is implemented. This research provides a possible seamless pedestrian navigation solution which can be applied to a wide range of areas where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal remains vulnerable.

The whole approach consists of three critical parts: wavelet decomposition module, parameters estimation module and SURE de-noising module. First, DB4 wavelet is selected as lifting base of the second-generation wavelet in the decomposition module. Second, in the parameters estimation module, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used for stochastic noise parameters estimation. Third, combined with soft threshold de-noising technique, the SURE de-noising module is designed. For comparison, both the traditional universal threshold wavelet and the second-generation Harr wavelet method are also investigated. The experiment results show that the computation cost is 40% less than that of the traditional wavelet method. The standard deviation of de-noised FOG signal is 0.012 and the three noise terms such as angle random walk, bias instability and quantization noise are reduced to 0.007 2° /o{script}h, 0.004 1° / h, and 0.008 1°, respectively. © Wuhan University and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2009.

0037344780	Sensor fusion in remote sensing satellites using a modified Kalman filter	The demand for remote sensing satellites is ever increasing due to their potential applications in many areas such as agriculture, forestry, water resources and so on. One of the key concerns in remote sensing satellite applications is that the accuracy of the attitude and orbit control must be maintained at a high level. In general applications, measurement of the attitude using only one type of sensor is satisfactory. However, in applications where a high precision of attitude control is required, several types of sensor need to be integrated together to ensure high measurement accuracy. In these cases, data fusion is required to process the information collected from different sensors. The least mean square method is commonly used for data fusion. This method is simple to use but not accurate enough. The Kalman filter (KF) is an alternative choice, which produces more accurate results, but a conventional KF fails to ensure error convergence due to limited knowledge of the system's dynamic model and measurement noise. In this paper, a modified KF is proposed to overcome the error divergence problem. The possible decrease in the signal processing results which appears in the classical KF can be avoided. The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated through a simulation study of the attitude measurement by the attitude and orbit control system of a remote sensing satellite used by the China Astronautic Board.

0038417233	A novel hybrid grey-based strategy for improving the model precision of a dynamically tuned gyroscope	This paper addresses several grey-based models for reducing the modelling error of a dynamically tuned gyroscope (DTG). Wavelet transform (WT) and linear regression techniques are introduced into the grey model to enhance the modelling capability of the GM (1, 1), which is a single variable first-order grey model. The raw DTG drift data are preprocessed by the WT to eliminate any disturbing impactive noise. The post-processing data are then used to construct the grey model. Due to the inherent errors between the modelling output values and actual data, the grey model is further compensated by the linear regression method. Long-term numerical results that measured x-axis and y-axis drift data of a DTG verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid strategies. The neural-network modelling method is also investigated to provide a comparison with the grey-based models. It is shown that the hybrid grey model gives a very satisfactory performance when both the WT and the linear regression methods are employed.

Thus, in order to improve fault detection sensibility, gyro's drift characteristics was analyzed and it is pointed out that the random drift is not only the main drift error which influences gyro's precision, but also the primary factor affecting gyro's reliability. Based on the analysis of the existing methods, this paper developed a diagnostic model which seriesly integrates the three promising technologies: wavelet transform, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy logic. Simulation was performed with real gyro's readings to evaluate the proposed diagnostic model.

The proposed diagnostic model increases the accuracy of the fault diagnosis and can be generalized to other devices' fault diagnosis and identification in the navigation systems.

0742322444	Temperature drift modelling of fibre optic gyroscopes based on a grey radial basis function neural network	In this paper, a novel type of neural network called a grey radial basis function network (GRBFN), is addressed and applied to reduce the temperature influence on the output of fibre optic gyroscopes (FOGs) and to improve their performance. The reasons why grey theory is introduced into the RBF neural network are based on two facts. First, the output of FOGs is affected greatly by environmental factors, especially by environmental temperature variation, hence there will be large randomness on output data. Second, the modelling performance will be affected by the randomness inherent in the output data of FOGs when a neural network approach is applied to the model. That is, poor performance results from large randomness and vice versa. The grey accumulated generating operation (AGO), a basis of the grey theory, is reported to possess a randomness reduction property. Because of these facts, the GRBFN model is presented and expected to have better modelling precision of temperature drift in FOGs. The proposed GRBFN model consists of the grey AGO, the RBF neural network, and the grey inverse accumulated generating operation (IAGO). Raw data are first preprocessed by the grey AGO and then put into the RBF network to perform modelling. Modelling results of the GRBFN are then obtained from the grey IAGO. The numerical results of real drift data under different temperatures from a certain type of FOG verify the effectiveness of the proposed GRBFN model powerfully. The RBF neural network modelling approach is also investigated to provide a comparison with the GRBFN model. Under identical training conditions, the GRBFN's training speed has been enhanced greatly. It is shown that the proposed GRBFN model with different network structures outperforms the RBF network itself.

The least-square estimation at multi-position test and Kalman filter for real-time estimation are respectively applied to acquire the remaining hard iron strength and soft iron coefficients. Its calibration results for HMR3300 digital magnetic compass show that the coarse calibration step and accurate calibration step can improve the heading accuracy under carrier magnetic disturbance. The heading accuracy of 1° can be achieved when the carrier tilt angle is less than 5% while the original deviation is 6.2°.

11144248152	Temperature drift modeling of fiber optical gyroscope based on projection pursuit learning network	Projection pursuit learning network (PPLN) was employed to establish the temperature drift of fiber optical gyroscope (FOG). The large temperature drift caused by the variation of environmental temperature is the main factor to holdback the FOG performance improving. Essentially, the FOG's temperature drift is a group of nonlinear time series related with temperature changing. The PPLN algorithm integrates the advantages of artificial neural network (ANN) and projection pursuit algorithm (PP), which is capable of providing less network neurons and good robustness. The algorithm was described, and the method was applied to analyze a certain FOG's temperature drift's model. Good predication of independent tested data was verified.

12744269942	On-the-fly ambiguity resolution based on null space constraints of GPS double-differential carrier phase	An efficient on-the-fly ambiguity resolution algorithm using non-dedicated GPS receivers was proposed. The double-differential carrier observation equation was transformed using null space transformation so that it need not to resolve real-time three-dimensional position parameters. The ambiguity search space was determined by short baseline length according to the principle of GPS interferometer. Three independent ambiguities are selected by XDOP to reduce the ambiguity candidates, along the baseline length constraint. The correct ambiguities was adopted by several statistical conditions aided by a low-precision heading reference. Trials were done by Garmin25 LP receivers to resolve the heading and pitch. It shows that the method can resolve the ambiguity reliably on-the-fly. The heading accuracy of the GPS attitude system can reach 1°.
