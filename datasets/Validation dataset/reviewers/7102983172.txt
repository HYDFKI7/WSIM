9544242758	A study on antiaging performances of two paving asphalts	In this article, the processes of Anshan oxidizing paving asphalts have been studied and the kinetic models for two paving asphalts were put forward. Based on the change of service performances, viscidity, and Gastel index (Ic), the aging resistance of the two asphalts have been compared. Meanwhile, the aging mechanism also has been investigated. The results show that the presented dynamics models can be used to describe the aging velocity for the two asphalts perfectly. According to dx/dt(AH-90) > dx/dt(AH-70), it can prove that the aging resistance of AH-70 is better than that of AH-90. After aging, the change of both penetration and softening point of AH-70 are lower than that of the corresponding parameters of AH-90, and the aging index of AH-70 is also lower than that of AH-90, which proves that the aging resistance of AH-70 is better than that of AH-90. During aging, every composition tends to be transformed into the heavier one. As a result, the asphltene content increases, the original colloidal structure of asphalt is destroyed to deteriorate paving performances of the asphalt.

20544455142	Application of molecular simulation for study of SBS modified asphalt	The dissolution mechanism between SBS modifier and asphalt was studied with the Computer Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) method. One type of the base asphalt models was defined for 3D amorphous cell construction. Molecular Mechanics (MM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) computations were carried out on these amorphous cell structures at customized temperatures to determine the lowest energy structures and hence the most stable configurations. The solubility parameters derived from the cohesive energy density (CED) of each amorphous cell system at different co-melting temperatures were calculated with the molecule modeling analysis module. Comparison of experimental and simulation data showed that the solubility of SBS line-shaped modifier in base asphalt was improved and reached that of star-shaped by adding a small amount of sulfur at co-melting temperature of 110°C. However, the solubility of both line-shaped and star-shaped modifiers is satisfactory at a higher temperature of 150°C even without sulfur addition. The CAMD method could be useful in preparing SBS modified asphalt.

3142532889	Photodegradation of p-nitrochlorbenzene (p-NCB) using nanometer-sized ZnO particles prepared by reactive evaporation method	Photocatalytic degradations of p-nitrochlorbenzene (p-NCB) with distilled water were investigated with ZnO crystals (catalyst) of 70 nm in diameter under UV irradiation. The suitable experimental conditions are determined as: ZnO 0.25g, pH 7, p-NCB concentration 30 mg/L. These variables in terms of the degradation rate have been discussed, which was defined as the rate of the initial degradation to the final degradation of p-NCB. When all of the experimental degradation rate values are plotted as a function of irradiation time, all of the points appeared on a single line for wide range of p-NCB degradations. On the basis of these results, it has been concluded that at lower ZnO catalyst amount, much of the light is transmitted through the slurry in the container beaker, while at higher catalyst amount, all the incident photons are observed by the slurry. Degradation rates of p-NCB were found to decrease with increasing solution pH. It has been concluded that the maximum degradation rate values of p-NCB under principally the same experimental conditions mentioned above are 97.4%, 98.8% and 95.5% at 100 min respectively. The results suggest that the photocatalytic degradation is initiated by an oxidation of the p-NCB through ZnO surface-adsorbed hydroxyl radicals. Absorption spectra are recorded using spectrophotometer before and after UV-irradiation in the wavelength range 200-400 nm at room temperature. It is found that the variation of irradiation time over the range 20-100 min resulted in change in the form of the spectrum linear absorption and a higher maximum value will be obtained at longer irradiation time.

Because of the poor compatibility between SBS and asphalt, however, the storage stability of SBS-modified asphalt is usually poor at elevated temperatures. The high-temperature storage stability of SBS copolymer modified asphalt can be improved significantly with the addition of a stabilizer. A stabilizer can improve the compatibility between SBS and asphalt, and increase the storage stability of SBS modified asphalt; SBS does not separate from base asphalt after one month of heated storage.

Better application performances of asphalt pavement are affected directly by proper SBR modifying. This paper shows some investigations that confirm the relationship between the addition of SBR with the structure and the properties of SBR-modified asphalt. This paper also discusses the modified asphalt high temperature property, low temperature ductility, and mechanism of SBR-modified asphalt. The addition of SBR modifier showed an increase in viscosity, softening point, and elastic recovery of modified asphalt with rising temperature. When the temperature rises, the improvement of SBR-modified asphalt in softening point, elastic recovery, and visco-toughness result from SBR cross-linking. Although the lengths of low temperature ductility of SBR-modified asphalt are increased, the viscosities of modified asphalt increase; however, the softening point between the upper layer and lower layer were about 1.8°C after the isolated experiment.

The optimum conditions for preparing porous photocatalytic materials by electroless composite plating method are 20 g/L nickel sulphate, 20 g/L sodium hypophosphite and 0.28 g/L P-25 nanometer titanium dioxide in the electroless composite plating solution, 90 °C and pH = 4.6.

Doping of bismuth oxide can decrease the photocatalytic performance of products. But the photocatalytic performance of products increases as compound dosage of bismuth oxide increases. Doping of zinc oxide can improve the photocatalytic performance of products and the more the zinc oxide, the better the photocatalytic performance of products.

According to reaction velocity constants, the optimum initial conditions of degradation were determined. It is 10 mg/L of Rhodamine B, 6 cm between light and solution, 6 cm thickness of solution and 0.4 g/L of titanium dioxide. The powder of P25-nanometer titanium dioxide with sodium fluorid was prepared by doping method. The crystal grains grow up because of burning and the quanta sizes function of nanometer powders decrease. After sodium fluorid doping, the fluorin ions are entered into the crystal lattice of titanium dioxide and oxygen are replaced, so the crystal lattices are contorted and the number of light-produced electrons and cavities is increased, the quanta sizes function of nanometer powders is counteracted and the photocatalytic performance of the sample is increased. The optimum mass fraction of sodium fluorid is 3%. When the amount of sodium fluorid doped is overmuch, the light-produced electrons and cavities are overmuch, too. The distance of electrons and cavities on the surface of nanometer powders is small, then the compounding probability of electrons and cavities increases and the photocatalytic performance of the sample decreases.

33846095093	Study on transfer process in porous media with chemical reaction in cylindrical coordinates	The chemical reactions between fluid and porous matrix and the fluid transfer process are proceeding simultaneously and interactively with each other in a porous reactor. A nonlinear mathematical model is developed for the convection/diffusion in cylindrical coordinates through Ergun-Forchheimer-Brinkman equation to express the fluid flow within the porous medium, which is solved discretely and numerically by an ADI (alternate dimension implicit) method. Taking the indirect reduction of iron ore in fixed bed as example, the profiles of the reactive gas concentration field and fractional conversion distribution of solid reactants are given by changing relevant parameters. The results show that the seepage flowrate and particle size are the important parameters affecting significantly the reactive characteristics of the porous reactor. An increase in convection velocity results in both increasing concentration fields of reactive gas and solid fractional conversion which also increases with decreasing particle size in the region near reactor entrance. But, when the region where the chemical reaction takes place deepens gradually, the solid fractional conversion distribution varies reversely, i.e., the solid fractional conversion decreases with particle size.

Retreatment of wood flour poses great effects on the properties of the composite. The wood flour treated with alkaline results in the reduction of tensile strength of the composite, however the wood flour treated with coupling agent leads to an increase in its tensile strength. When added with electrical PAn, not only its strength is increased, but also its electricity gets improvement with resistivity reached up 1 GΩ·cm. Particle diameter of wood flour, its different treatment and the addition of PAn all have a perceptible influence on the properties of the wood flour PVC composite. On condition that the requirement on material strength is not very high, composing wood flour and PVC will greatly reduce the composite cost. If we add electrical PAn into it, we may get the resist-electrostatic wood/plastic composite.

58149175797	The effectiveness of strong afterglow phosphor powder in the detection of fingermarks	There are numerous types of fluorescent fingermark powders or reagents used with the visualization of latent fingermarks deposited on multicolored substrate surfaces that can present a contrast problem if developed with regular fingermark powders. The developed fingermarks can show bright fluorescence upon exposure to laser, ultraviolet light and other light sources. These kinds of methods share a common concern, where surfaces and other substrates may fluoresce also. To overcome this concern, we have developed a phosphor powder which offers a strong afterglow effect which aid in the establishment of better fingermark detection. With the advent of a phosphor powder no special devices are required and the results obtained from fresh or a few days aged latent fingermarks left on: non-porous; semi-porous and also on some porous surfaces have been good. The strong afterglow effect offered by phosphor powder is also applicable for cyanoacrylate fumed fingermarks. Lift off and photography procedures of the developed fingermarks are incorporated in this paper. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The supported catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was synthesized by chemical reduction and deposition under ultrasonic dispersion. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that iridium (Ir) particles with sizes of about 10-40 nm are mainly dispersed on the outside surface of titanium carbide (TiC). The PEMWE using the supported Ir/TiC (40 wt% lr) as the anode catalyst shows the best performance among the supported catalysts of three different Ir contents. Increasing the cell temperature in the PEMWE can enhance the activity of the catalyst and lower the over-potential of the electrodes, which can improve the performance of the PEMWE.

In this study, TiC supported Pt-Ir electrocatalysts (Pt-Ir/TiC) for oxygen electrode in URFCs were synthesized, respectively, by chemical reduction process and plasma reduction process. Their physical and electrochemical properties are characterized and compared using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cyclic voltammogram (CV), potentiostatic technique, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results from XRD, XPS and TEM demonstrate that the plasma process gives a finer metal crystals and higher metal dispersion on the TiC support. The CV, polarization, potentiostatic and EIS results show that the Pt-Ir/TiC electrocatalyst prepared by the plasma reduction process is obviously more active than that by the chemical reduction process, in agreement with the above metal-dispersion observations.

The results showed that the wear rate and the friction coefficient values of the composites are lower than the matrix alloy at 20 N load, the wear rate of 0.6%SiC/AA6061 decreases 50% than the matrix. This is attributed to the strong bonding between the matrix and the particles in the composites. So the presence of SiC particles in the composites improves the wear resistance because these particles remain intact and retain their load-bearing capacity, they promote the formation of iron-rich transfer layer. The dominant wear mechanisms are found to be abrasion for the AA6061 alloy and its composites at 20 N load.

The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/ desorption, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the properties of zeolite 13X@silicalite and zeolite 13X@mesoporous silica core-shells composite structures are well maintained even after the modification. As expected, the shell thickness increased with increase in synthesis time, however, the micropore volume decreased. Silylation with smaller organosilanes (trimethyl chlorosilane) resulted in decrease in surface area as they diffused through the pores; however, bulkier silane reacted with surface hydroxyl groups and maintained the pore structure.

0043028246	Eliminating aniline in water by sodium permanganate oxidation	Eliminating aniline in water was investigated by sodium permanganate. It is showed that with the increase of sodium permanganate, aniline eliminating rate increases. Aniline eliminating rate reaches 92.12% by the condition of aniline concentration lO mg/L, temperature 18°C ,pH 6.8, reaction time 30 min and sodium permanganate 30 mg/L. The pH value of water sample plays a role on aniline elimination. The effect of removing aniline in alid or alkaline solutions is more significant than in neutral water. The aniline eliminating rate is 97.55% at pH value 3 and 96.33% at pH value 11. Increasing the temperature or the reaction time has good effects on removing aniline. By the cooperation of permanganate and the formed oxygen, aniline is oxidated into guinone and removed.

84891697291	Percolative metal-organic framework/carbon composites for hydrogen storage	Percolative Metal-organic framework/Carbon (MOFAC) composites are synthesized by IRMOF8 (isoreticular metal-organic frameworks) directly depositing on activated carbon via heterogeneous nucleation. Carbon content is calculated by TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) tests. XRD (X-ray diffraction) and FESEM (Field emission-scanning electron microscope) are carried out to characterize the structures of the samples. BET surface areas and the pore size distribution are measured. The dielectric constant is measured with impedance analyzer and a specially designed sample holder. The dielectric constants of the MOFAC composites rise with increasing the carbon content, and the composites possess the insulator-conductor transition as the carbon content increases from 17.77 wt% to 22.2 wt%. The composites are further tested for hydrogen storage capability under assist of the PMN-PT (single crystal lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate) generated electric field. With help from the PMN-PT, the hydrogen uptake capability is increased about 31.5% over the MOFAC3 (MOF-Carbon composite with 22.2 wt% of carbon) without PMN-PT, which is elucidated by the charge distribution mechanisms. The improved storage is due to a stronger electrostatic interaction between IRMOF8 and hydrogen molecule caused by field polarization. Meanwhile, rapid adsorption/desorption kinetics and total reversibility on the samples are observed in the present or absence of external electric field. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Though so far, this catalyst has been regarded as the dominant catalyst for methanol synthesis. The catalyst is still facing some fundamental challenges such as the dispersion of active center CuO/ZnO. Meanwhile, to prepare this catalyst, large amount of nitrate precursor was used and produced lots of environmentally harmful wastewater. In the current work, a bimodal carbon channel-confined CuO/ZnO supported on mesoporous carbon catalyst was synthesized by using a simple impregnation method followed by ammonia hydrolysis and pyrolysis.

10644257518	Thermodynamics of irreversible process in homogeneous single chemical reaction	The prevalent linear thermodynamic expressions of irreversible process are just available to those physicochemical changes which are close to equilibrium. On the other hand, the studies on the physicochemical changes far from equilibrium are mainly focusing on dissipative structures. A nonlinear dynamic equation is therefore set up for the chemical reactions far from equilibrium by way of extending the linear expressions to the homogeneous single chemical reaction systems far from equilibrium with no dissipative structure involved. The equation has been applied to water-gas reaction with a quintic expression obtained in high conformity to measured data with a maximum error of 8%. The result reveals that in such a way the thermodynamics of irreversible process can be applied to homogeneous single chemical reaction systems far from equilibrium.

12144250660	Thermodynamics of irreversible processes in reaction of hydrogen peroxide	Thermodynamics of irreversible process offers linear expressions among different physical quantities when there are physical-chemistry changes in the systems close to equilibrium. Extending such existing linear expressions to those systems which are not only far from equilibrium but without dissipative structure formed, a general nonlinear equation is given to express the chemical reaction rate that is the only one in a heterogeneous system. The equation is applied to the catalytic reaction of hydrogen peroxide, i.e., a classical thermodynamic problem, some quartic expressions are obtained in conformity to the experiment data at 298 K and 308 K correspondingly. It shows that the thermodynamics of irreversible process can be applied to those chemical reacting systems which are far from equilibrium if taking the higher terms into consideration. In the higher degree approximation process, however, the different degrees of higher terms require different reactive conditions depending on how far away they are from equilibrium. The extensional application of linear thermodynamic expressions thus provides a new approach to the study on the chemical reactions far from equilibrium.
