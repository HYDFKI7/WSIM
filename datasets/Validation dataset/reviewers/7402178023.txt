33744458689	RNA interference with chemically modified siRNA	siRNA has become an indispensable tool for functional characterization of genes. It has also demonstrated tremendous potential as a new generation of drug candidates. Although the technology works very well to a great panel of cells in vitro, it is still a challenge to translate the success into in vivo target validation easiness and, even more difficult, into therapeutic applications. With a number of chemically modified compounds under initial clinical trial from several commercial entities, the interests in chemical modification of siRNA have become heightened. In this review we have tried to touch on most of the chemical modifications of RNA that have been tested in the siRNA landscape, but maintained a focus on the backbone modifications, and 2′-modifications on the ribose ring. It is anticipated that more modifications and more systematic comparisons between different modifications will be performed to draw more educated conclusions over some of the modifications. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

33745779453	Rapid identification of small interfering RNA that can effectively inhibit the replication of multiple influenza B virus strains	Influenza B virus is a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in humans and current vaccination strategies and antiviral drugs only provide limited protection. Here, we report the evaluation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for repression of viral replication in cultured cells as well as in chicken embryos. Several siRNAs targeting conserved regions of the virus (in chemically synthesized or plasmid-encoded forms) were found to effectively block the replication of the influenza B virus. The siRNAs were found to offer broad protection over several strains of influenza B virus (B/Beijing/76/98, B/Beijing/37/99 and B/Jiangsu/10/03) that differ substantially in their genetic content. The antiviral effects of 500 ng siRNA-encoding plasmids or 60 nmoles synthetic siRNA were found to be comparable to that of 3.6 μg ribavirin. These results indicated that RNA interference warrants further study for management of influenza B virus infections. © 2006 International Medical Press.

34547187045	Studies on aminoisonucleoside modified siRNAs: Stability and silencing activity	A novel class of aminoisonucleoside was synthesized and incorporated into a luciferase gene-targeting siRNA. Structural and functional analyses of such a kind of siRNAs indicated that sense strand modifications with aminoisonucleoside at the 3′ or 5′ terminal, such as ssIso-1 and ssIso-2, have less effect on RNA duplex thermal and serum stabilities, and their functional activities are also comparable to their native siRNAs. In contrast, antisense strand modifications with aminoisonucleoside at the corresponding positions, such as asIso-2 or asIso-1, bring a striking negative effect on RNA duplex stability but still maintain around 40-50% of gene knockdown. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

39749200012	Focusing on RISC assembly in mammalian cells	RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) is a central protein complex in RNAi, into which a siRNA strand is assembled to become effective in gene silencing. By using an in vitro RNAi reaction based on Drosophila embryo extract, an asymmetric model was recently proposed for RISC assembly of siRNA strands, suggesting that the strand that is more loosely paired at its 5′ end is selectively assembled into RISC and results in target gene silencing. However, in the present study, we were unable to establish such a correlation in cell-based RNAi assays, as well as in large-scale RNAi data analyses. This suggests that the thermodynamic stability of siRNA is not a major determinant of gene silencing in mammalian cells. Further studies on fork siRNAs showed that mismatch at the 5′ end of the siRNA sense strand decreased RISC assembly of the antisense strand, but surprisingly did not increase RISC assembly of the sense strand. More interestingly, measurements of melting temperature showed that the terminal stability of fork siRNAs correlated with the positions of the mismatches, but not gene silencing efficacy. In summary, our data demonstrate that there is no definite correlation between siRNA stability and gene silencing in mammalian cells, which suggests that instead of thermodynamic stability, other features of the siRNA duplex contribute to RISC assembly in RNAi. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

34249084388	High-throughput screening using siRNA (RNAi) libraries	RNA interference (RNAi) has become one of the most important research tools in functional genomics analysis ever since the discovery of the phenomenon. The robustness of the method has enabled construction of RNAi libraries in the forms of long double-stranded RNA or short-interfering RNA that can cover the whole or significant parts of the genomes of different organisms. Over the last few years, such libraries have been used in different high-throughput formats to establish functional links between genes and phenotypes.

80052962159	Structural contributions of blocked or grafted poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) on PEGylated polycaprolactone nanoparticles in siRNA delivery	The multiformity in polymer structure and conformation design provides a great potential in improving the gene silencing efficiency of siRNA by polymer vectors. In order to provide information on the polymer design for siRNA delivery, the structural contributions of blocked or grafted poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) on PEGylated polycaprolactone nanoparticles (NPs) in siRNA delivery were studied. Herein, two kinds of self-assembly nanoparticles (NPs) formed by amphiphilic cationic polymers, methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-polycaprolactone-block-poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (mPEG-PCL-b-PDMAEMA, PEC. bD) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-(polycaprolactone-graft-poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)) (mPEG-PCL-g-PDMAEMA, PEC. gD), were used to deliver siRNA for in vitro and in vivo studies. The physiochemical properties including size and zeta potential of PEC. bD NPs/siRNA and PEC. gD NPs/siRNA complexes were characterized. In vitro cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and siRNA knockdown efficiency were evaluated in HeLa-Luc cells. The endosome escape and intracellular distribution of PEC. bD NPs/siRNA and PEC. gD NPs/siRNA in HeLa-Luc cells were also observed. In vivo polymer mediated siRNA delivery and the complexes distribution in isolated organs were studied using mice and tumor-bearing mice. At the same total degree of polymerization (DP) of DMAEMA, PEC. gD NPs/siRNA complexes possessed higher zeta potentials than PEC. bD NPs/siRNA complexes (at the same N/P ratio), which may be the reason that PEC. gD NPs/siRNA complexes can deliver more siRNA into the cytoplasm and lead to higher in vitro luciferase and lamin A/C silencing efficiency than PEC. bD NPs/siRNA complexes. The in vivo imaging measurement and histochemical analysis also confirmed that siRNA could be delivered to lungs, livers, pancreas and HeLa-Luc tumors more efficiently by PEC. gD NPs than PEC. bD NPs. Meanwhile, the PDMAEMA chains of PEC. gD could be shortened which provides benefits for clearing. Therefore, PEC. gD NPs have great potential to be used as efficient non-viral carriers for in vivo siRNA delivery. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84877730567	Intracellular cleavable poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles for efficient siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo	A low cytotoxicity and high efficiency delivery system with the advantages of low cost and facile fabrication is needed for the application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery both in vitro and in vivo. For these prerequisites, cationic polymer-mesoporous silica nanoparticles (ssCP-MSNs) were prepared by surface functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles with disulfide bond cross-linked poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). In vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed. The synthesized ssCP-MSNs are 100-150 nm in diameter with a pore size of 10 nm and a positively charged surface with a high zeta potential of 27 mV. Consequently, the ssCP-MSNs showed an excellent binding capacity for siRNA, and an enhancement in the cell uptake and cytosolic availability of siRNA. Furthermore, the intracellular reducing cleavage of the disulfide bonds cross-linking the PDMAEMA segments led to intracellular cleavage of PDMAEMA from ssCP-MSNs, which facilitated the intracellular triggered release of siRNA. Therefore, promoted RNA interference was observed in HeLa-Luc cells, which was equal to that of Lipofectamine 2000. Significantly, compared to Lipofectamine 2000, the ssCP-MSNs were more biocompatible, with low cytotoxicity (even non-cytotoxicity) and promotion of cell proliferation to HeLa-Luc cells. The in vivo systemic distribution studies certified that ssCP-MSNs/siRNA could prolong the duration of siRNA in vivo, and that they accumulated in the adrenal gland, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, heart and thymus after intravenous injection. Encouragingly, with the ability to deliver siRNA to a tumor, ssCP-MSNs/siRNA showed a tumor suppression effect in the HeLa-Luc xenograft murine model after intravenous injection. Therefore, the ssCP-MSNs cationic polymer-mesoporous silica nanoparticles with low cytotoxicity are promising for siRNA delivery. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

44449149276	Analysis of siRNA specificity on targets with double-nucleotide mismatches	Although RNA interference as a tool for gene knockdown is a great promise for future applications, the specificity of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing needs to be thoroughly investigated. Most research regarding siRNA specificity has involved analysis of affected off-target genes instead of exploring the specificity of the siRNA itself. In this study we have developed an efficient method for generating a siRNA target library by combining a siRNA target validation vector with a nucleotide oligomix. We have used this library to perform an analysis of the silencing effects of a functional siRNA towards its target site with double-nucleotide mismatches. The results indicated that not only the positions of the mismatched base pair have an impact on silencing efficiency but also the identity of the mismatched nucleotide. Our data strengthen earlier observations of widespread siRNA off-target effects and shows that ∼35% of the double-mutated target sites still causes knockdown efficiency of >50%. We also provide evidence that there may be substantial differences in knockdown efficiency depending on whether the mutations are positioned within the siRNA itself or in the corresponding target site. © 2008 The Author(s).

68149163646	PAMAM dendrimers mediate siRNA delivery to target Hsp27 and produce potent antiproliferative effects on prostate cancer cells	RNA interference (RNAi) holds great promise for the treatment of inherited and acquired diseases, provided that safe and efficient delivery systems are available. Herein we report that structurally flexible triethanolamine (TEA) core PAMAM dendrimers are able to deliver an Hsp27 siRNA effectively into prostate cancer (PC-3) cells by forming stable nanoparticles with siRNA, protecting the siRNA nanoparticles from enzymatic degradation, and enhancing cellular uptake of siRNA. The Hsp27 siRNA resulted in potent and specific gene silencing of heat-shock protein 27, an attractive therapeutic target in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Silencing of the hsp27 gene led to induction of caspase-3/7-dependent apoptosis and inhibition of PC-3 cell growth in vitro. In addition, the siRNA-dendrimer complexes are non-cytotoxic under the conditions used for siRNA delivery. Altogether, TEA core PAMAM dendrimer-mediated siRNA delivery, in combination with RNAi that specifically targets Hsp27, may constitute a promising approach for combating castrate-resistant prostate cancer, for which there is no efficacious treatment. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

73649111445	The consideration of synthetic short interfering RNA for therapeutic use	Small RNA molecules can act as regulators of post-transcriptional gene silencing and can target any given protein via the RNA interference pathway. This leads to the high expectation of small interference RNA (siRNA) as a therapeutic platform. Many companies and organisations are active in this development, which consequently forces siRNA's pharmacokinetic studies because pharmacokinetics plays an important role in elucidating the pharmacodynamic and toxicological mechanism of test articles. In particular, pharmacokinetics is mandatory in investigational new drug application in many countries. Some pre-clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic results have already been published and the fate of siRNA compounds in biological matrices has been explored in depth. The elucidation of the siRNA's metabolism improves the rational design of siRNA for disease control. This review focuses on the study of synthetic siRNA pharmacokinetics, the challenges of siRNA as a therapeutic agent and the strategies involved for improving siRNA bioavailability from the view of siRNA metabolism. © 2009 Nordic Pharmacological Society.

75649121811	Profiling of mismatch discrimination in RNAi enabled rational design of allele-specific siRNAs	Silencing specificity is a critical issue in the therapeutic applications of siRNA, particularly in the treatment of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diseases where discrimination against single nucleotide variation is demanded. However, no generally applicable guidelines are available for the design of such allele-specific siRNAs. In this paper, the issue was approached by using a reporter-based assay. With a panel of 20 siRNAs and 240 variously mismatched target reporters, we first demonstrated that the mismatches were discriminated in a position-dependent order, which was however independent of their sequence contexts using position 4th, 12th and 17th as examples. A general model was further built for mismatch discrimination at all positions using 230 additional reporter constructs specifically designed to contain mismatches distributed evenly along the target regions of different siRNAs. This model was successfully employed to design allele-specific siRNAs targeting disease-causing mutations of PIK3CA gene at two SNP sites. Furthermore, conformational distortion of siRNA-target duplex was observed to correlate with the compromise of gene silencing. In summary, these findings could dramatically simplify the design of allele-specific siRNAs and might also provide guide to increase the specificity of therapeutic siRNAs. © The Author(s) 2009.

77949617195	An estrogen receptor α suppressor, microRNA-22, is downregulated in estrogen receptor α-positive human breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples	Previous studies have suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play important roles in tumorigenesis, but little is known about the functions of most miRNAs in cancer development. In the present study, we set up a cell-based screen using a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the whole ∼ 4.7 kb 3′-UTR of estrogen receptor α (ERα) mRNA cotransfected with a synthetic miRNA expression library to identify potential ERα-targeting miRNAs. Among all the miRNAs, miR-22 was found to repress robustly the luciferase signal in both HEK-293T and ERα-positive MCF-7 cells. Mutation of the target site was found to abrogate this repression effect of miR-22, whereas antagonism of endogenous miR-22 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in elevated reporter signals. We assessed the miR-22 expression patterns in five breast cancer cell lines and 23 clinical biopsies and revealed that there is a significant inverse association between the miR-22 levels and ERα protein expression. To evaluate the potential of miR-22 as a potential therapeutic intervention, we found that reduction of endogenous ERα protein levels and suppression of cancer cell growth could be achieved in MCF-7 cells by miR-22 overexpression in a way that can be recapitulated by the introduction of specific small interfering RNA against ERα. The phenomena can be rescued by the reintroduction of ERα. Taken together, our data indicate that miR-22 was frequently downregulated in ERα-positive human breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples. Direct involvement in the regulation of ERα may be one of the mechanisms through which miR-22 could play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. © 2010 FEBS.

77953632069	Exogenous nucleic acids aggregate in non-P-body cytoplasmic granules when transfected into cultured cells	To modulate gene expression in research studies or in potential clinical therapies, transfection of exogenous nucleic acids including plasmid DNA and small interference RNA (siRNA) are generally performed. However, the cellular processing and the fate of these nucleic acids remain elusive. By investigating the cellular behavior of transfected nucleic acids using confocal imaging, here we show that when siRNA was co-transfected into cultured cells with other nucleic acids, including single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, single and double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, as well as long double-stranded plasmid DNA, they all aggregate in the same cytoplasmic granules. Interestingly, the amount of siRNA aggregating in granules was found not to correlate with the gene silencing activity, suggesting that assembly of cytoplasmic granules triggered by siRNA transfection may be separable from the siRNA silencing event. Our results argue against the claim that the siRNA-aggregating granules are the functional site of RNA interference (RNAi). Taken together, our studies suggest that, independent of their types or forms, extraneously transfected nucleic acids are processed through a common cytoplasmic pathway and trigger the formation of a new type of cytoplasmic granules "transfection granules". © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77956338502	Tumor-suppressive microRNA-22 inhibits the transcription of E-box-containing c-Myc target genes by silencing c-Myc binding protein	Oncogenic c-Myc has been described to modulate the expression of a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs), which include miR-22; however, the mechanism through which a miRNA controls c-Myc activity remains unclear. Here we report a novel anti-c-Myc function mediated by miR-22. Ectopically expressed miR-22 inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of human cancer cell lines. Microarray screening and western analyses revealed that miR-22 repressed the c-Myc-binding protein MYCBP, a positive regulator of c-Myc. Consistent with this, reporter assays showed that miR-22-mediated MYCBP gene suppression largely depends on the conserved miR-22 target site within the MYCBP 3′-untranslational region (3′UTR), implying that MYCBP mRNA is a direct miR-22 target. Depletion of MYCBP using small interfering RNA (siRNA) recapitulated the miR-22-induced anti-growth effect on tumor cells, whereas ectopically expressed MYCBP rescued cells from the growth suppression mediated by miR-22. Moreover, repression of MYCBP by miR-22 downregulated a panel of E-box-containing c-Myc target genes. Our results suggest that miR-22 acts as a tumor suppressor through direct repression of MYCBP expression and subsequent reduction of oncogenic c-Myc activities. As c-Myc inhibits the expression of miR-22, we propose a novel positive feedback loop formed by oncogenic c-Myc to accelerate cell proliferation by suppressing miR-22, a potent inhibitor of MYCBP. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

77957302255	Enhanced gene delivery and siRNA silencing by gold nanoparticles coated with charge-reversal polyelectrolyte	Charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles first prepared by layer-by-layer technique were employed to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) and plasmid DNA into cancer cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis measurements of siRNA confirmed the occurrence of the charge-reversal property of functional gold nanoparticles. The expression efficiency of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was improved by adjuvant transfection with charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, which also had much lower toxicity to cell proliferation. Lamin A/C, an important nuclear envelope protein, was effectively silenced by lamin A/C-siRNA delivered by charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, whose knockdown efficiency was better than that of commercial Lipofectamine 2000. Confocal laser scanning microscopic images indicated that there was more cy5-siRNA distributed throughout the cytoplasm for cyanine 5-siRNA/polyethyleneimine/cis-aconitic anhydride-functionalized poly(allylamine)/ polyethyleneimine/11- mercaptoundecanoic acid-gold nanoparticle (cy5-siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/PEI/MUA-AuNP) complexes.

78349247916	Discovery of novel cell proliferation-enhancing gene by random siRNA library based combinatorial screening	Bone remodeling is tightly controlled by the actions of osteoblast and osteoclast. Impaired osteoblast proliferation and differentiation may disrupt the balance and lead to pathological symptom such as osteoporosis. To help understand the molecular mechanism of osteoblast proliferation, we performed a phenotype-driven high throughput screening with a random siRNA library, in search of novel genes that can accelerate murine preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. Three siRNAs screened from the library were able to enhance MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation significantly. One of the proliferation-enhancing siRNAs (B7) was further subjected to expression profiling to pinpoint genes that putatively act down stream of it. A number of genes were regulated in response to proliferation-enhancing siRNA B7. Among these genes, Tmed2, which has never been reported yet in cell proliferation, was verified to be able to enhance MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation when over-expressed. Our screening process with random siRNA library provided an alternative strategy in addition to gene-specific siRNA library, in search of novel functional genes in genome scale. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

78649722174	Comprehensive analysis of sequence-specific stability of siRNA	Double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are important modulators of biological processes and hold great promise for therapeutic applications. However, serum processing of synthetic siRNAs is still largely unknown. To address this issue, serum degradation assays of 125 siRNAs were first performed in this study. Four siRNA categories of distinct serum stability were identified, including a group of siRNAs that were stable in their native form for both in vitro and in vivo assays. Fine mapping of the cleavage events occurring in serum treatment demonstrated that most occurred at two vulnerable sites, leading to a speculation that rational modification of these sites might protect most siRNAs from serum degradation. For proof of concept, an exhaustive siRNA modification study was performed. In addition to the consistent stabilization pattern revealed at these sites, our study further showed that a single modification made at the cleavage site stabilized the siRNAs to a large extent, highlighting the importance of these sites in siRNA degradation. In summary, the present study provided a comprehensive picture of serum processing of siRNA as well as a starting point for a rational siRNA modification strategy, both of which are of great importance to in vivo and therapeutic applications of siRNA. © FASEB.

Blocking this pathway resulted in the absence of siRNA fluorescence within the intestine, with greatly enhanced siRNA accumulation in liver and gallbladder at the same time.

Differentiation therapy is a strategy to alleviate malignant phenotypes by inducing cancer cell differentiation. Here we carried out a combinatorial high-throughput screen with a random siRNA library on human erythroleukemia K-562 cell differentiation. Two siRNAs screened from the library were validated to be able to induce erythroid differentiation to varying degrees, determined by CD235 and globin up-regulation, GATA-2 down-regulation, and cell growth inhibition. The screen we performed here is the first trial of screening cancer differentiation-inducing agents from a random siRNA library, demonstrating that a random siRNA library can be considered as a new resource in efforts to seek new therapeutic agents for cancers. As a random siRNA library has a broad coverage for the entire genome, including known/unknown genes and protein coding/non-coding sequences, screening using a random siRNA library can be expected to greatly augment the repertoire of therapeutic siRNAs for cancers. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

In this paper, ternary complexes by coating polyglutamic acid-graft-poly(ethylene glycol)(PGA-g-mPEG) onto binary complexes of polycaprolactone-graft-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PCL-g-PDMAEMA) nanoparticles (NPs)/DNA were firstly developed for effective and targeted gene delivery. The coating of PGA-g-mPEG was able to decrease the zeta potential of the nano-sized DNA complexes nearly to electroneutrality without interferring with DNA condensation ability. As a result, the stability, the escape ability from endosomes and the transfection efficiency of the complexes were enhanced. The ternary complexes of PCL-g-PDMAEMA NPs/DNA/PGA-g-mPEG demonstrated lower cytotoxicity in CCK-8 measurements and higher gene transfection efficiency than the binary complexes in vitro. In addition, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed to quantify the membrane-damaging effects of the complexes, which is consistent with the conclusion of CCK-8 measurement for cytotoxicity assay. The in vivo imaging measurement and histochemical analysis of tumor sessions confirmed that the intravenous administration of the ternary complexes with red fluorescent protein (RFP) as payload led to protein expression in tumor, which was further enhanced by the targeted coating of PGA-g-PEG-folate. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

HIV-infected humanized Rag2 / γc / mice (RAG-hu) were injected intravenously (i.v.) with dendrimer-siRNA nanoparticles consisting of a cocktail of dicer substrate siRNAs (dsiRNAs) targeting both viral and cellular transcripts. We report in this study that the dendrimer-dsiRNA treatment suppressed HIV-1 infection by several orders of magnitude and protected against viral induced CD4 T-cell depletion. We also demonstrated that follow-up injections of the dendrimer-cocktailed dsiRNAs following viral rebound resulted in complete inhibition of HIV-1 titers. Biodistribution studies demonstrate that the dendrimer-dsiRNAs preferentially accumulate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and liver and do not exhibit any discernable toxicity. These data demonstrate for the first time efficacious combinatorial delivery of anti-host and-viral siRNAs for HIV-1 treatment in vivo. The dendrimer delivery approach therefore represents a promising method for systemic delivery of combinations of siRNAs for treatment of HIV-1 infection. © The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy.

However, the use of circulating miR-122 in the evaluation of liver function has never been reported. In the present study, changes of serum miRNA levels were first evaluated in acute human hepatotoxicity due to paraquat exposure. Serum samples were collected and analyzed using real-time reverse transcription PCR. The results showed a positive correlation between serum miR-122 and alanine aminotransferase, a clinical biomarker for liver function. Furthermore, serum miR-122 was assessed in patients with hepatitis B and hepatocarcinoma, resulting in distinct miR-122 profiles in these two closely related diseases. In addition to miR-122, another small RNA, U6 small nuclear RNA, was downregulated in hepatocarcinoma patients, suggesting its prognostic significance in this disease. Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that serum miR-122 may provide a biomarker for diverse liver diseases and, more importantly, suggest that a combination of nucleic acid biomarkers may be used as a sensitive and specific index for discriminating closely related diseases.

84860474881	A flow-through electroporation chip integrated with viable cell sorting based on dielectrophoresis	Flow-through electroporation on a chip is a promising technique to introduce molecules into cells in applications of biological research, drug delivery and gene therapy. During the electroporation process, the electrical field also causes large amount of non-viable cells, which significantly influence the following biological procedure. Off-chip separation of the variable cells increases experimental complexity dramatically and results in further cell death. In this paper, we have developed a flow-through electroporation chip, in which dielectrophoresis (DEP) is employed to sort the viable cells and non-viable cells on chip. For the standard expression cell line HEK-293a (Human embryonic kidney cells), the ratio of the viable cells in the sorted sample was increased to 90% from 20% in the as-electroporated sample. © 2012 IEEE.

84863039857	Characterization of a carcinogenesis-associated long non-coding RNA	A negative selection strategy was used in the present study to isolate long polyA-minus RNAs from the total transcriptome and a long non-coding RNA named Yiya was identified. Yiya is a 1.9 kb long intergenic ncRNA gene mapped to chromosome 1q41, a well-established cancer susceptibility locus. Expression profiling revealed a general and regulated expression pattern of Yiya in major tissues, and more interestingly, identified elevated mRNA levels in different cancers. Quantitative analysis further demonstrated a dynamic regulation of Yiya expression in cell cycle progression, suggesting that it was involved in cell cycle regulation. Supporting this, overexpression of Yiya promotes cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition, therefore identifying Yiya as a cell-cycle-associated long non-coding RNA. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84865572080	Modification of the siRNA Passenger Strand by 5-Nitroindole Dramatically Reduces its Off-Target Effects	During the formation of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the passenger and guide strand of an siRNA duplex separate from each other to generate an active RISC complex. Accumulating evidence shows that an siRNA passenger strand can also assemble into a RISC complex and mediate RNA interference, thereby causing undesired off-target effects. To reduce this effect, the so-called "universal base" 5-nitroindole nucleotides were incorporated into an siRNA passenger strand. Melting temperature and circular dichroism spectrum measurements showed no significant changes compared to the unmodified duplex, thus indicating the formation of normal A-form conformation. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay, we have further shown that 5-nitroindole modification at position 15 of the siRNA passenger strand drastically decreased the RNAi (RNA interfering) potency of this strand, whereas the potency of the RNA guide strand was not much affected. These results could provide a practical approach for reducing off-target effects mediated by the siRNA passenger strand. siRNA song: Introduction of a 5-nitroindole at position 15 of the passenger siRNA strand significantly reduces the undesired silencing activity of the modified passenger strand, while maintaining the desired guide strand efficiency in RNAi machinery. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84869044165	siRNA Has Greatly Elevated Mismatch Tolerance at 3′-UTR Sites	It has been noted that target sites located in the coding region or the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) can be silenced to significantly different levels by the same siRNA, but little is known about at what specificity the silencing was achieved. In an exploration of positional effects on siRNA specificity by luciferase reporter system, we surprisingly discovered that siRNA had greatly elevated tolerance towards mismatches in target sites in the 3′-UTR of the mRNA compared with the same target sites cloned in the coding region. Assessment of changes in protein and mRNA levels suggested that the differential mismatch tolerance might have resulted from location-specific translational repression in the 3′-UTR. Ablation of argonaute proteins by AGO-specific siRNAs revealed that the AGO2 had major impact on siRNA silencing activity against sites in both coding region and 3′-UTR, while the silencing of nonnucleolytic AGO proteins (AGO1, AGO3 and AGO4) did not significantly affect silencing of sites in either region. This paper revealed the discovery that the specificity of an siRNA can be affected by the location of its target site. © 2012 Wei et al.

84873478178	The effect of guanidinylation of PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) on the systemic delivery of siRNA	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has a huge potential for the treatment or prevention of various diseases. However, to realize the therapeutic potential of siRNA drugs, efficient, tissue-specific and safe delivery technologies must be developed. Here we synthesized two kinds of polymers (PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) labeled as PEG-b-PAEM or PEA, and guanidinylated PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) marked as PEG-b-PAEM-co-PGEM or PEAG) using atom transfer radical polymerization and evaluated their capability of mediating siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo. Both polymers presented excellent siRNA encapsulation ability, formed regular nanostructures with siRNA, robustly mediated cellular internalization and cytoplasmic localization of siRNA, and resulted in targeted gene knockdown efficiently. However, PEAG showed much more outstanding abilities referring to above evaluating indicators compared with PEA. Both PEA/siRNA and PEAG/siRNA polyplexes displayed strong liver, lung and spleen accumulation in mice for a long time after intravenous administration. PEAG/siApoB polyplexes (single dose at 1 mg/kg) further repressed ApoB expression in liver and resulted in block of lipid transportation. In addition, both polymers delivered high amounts of siRNA into tumor tissue in the Hela-Luc xenograft murine model. More siRNA accumulated in tumor with the increase of N/. P ratio and PEAG/siRNA polyplexes showed higher siRNA accumulation than PEA/siRNA polyplexes at the same N/. P ratio. These findings set the stage for further studies of structural-functional mechanisms and developments of siRNA therapeutics. © 2013 .

84877356460	Method for electric parametric characterization and optimization of electroporation on a chip	We have developed a rapid method to optimize the electric parameters of cell electroporation. In our design, a pair of ring-dot formatted electrodes was used to generate a radial distribution of electric field from the center to the periphery. Varied electric field intensity was acquired in different annulus when an electric pulse was applied. Cells were cultured on the microchips for adherent cell electroporation and in situ observation. The electroporation parameters of electric field intensity were explored and evaluated in terms of cell viability and transfection efficiency. The optimization was performed in consideration of both cell viability, which was investigated to decrease as electric field increases, and the transfection rate, which normally increases at stronger electric field. The electroporation characteristics HEK-293A and Hela cells were investigated, and the optimum parameters were obtained. Verified by a commercial electroporation system as well as self-made microchips endowed the optimization with wider meaning. At last, as applications, we acquired the optimal electroporation pulse intensity of Neuro-2A cells and a type of primary cell (human umbilical vein endothelial cell, HUVEC) by one time electroporation using the proposed method. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84879492510	RNA-seq identified a super-long intergenic transcript functioning in adipogenesis	RNA transcripts are generally classified into polyA-plus and polyA-minus subgroups due to the presence or absence of a polyA tail at the 3′ end. Even though a number of physiologically and pathologically important polyA-minus RNAs have been recently identified, a systematic analysis of the expression and function of these transcripts in adipogenesis is still elusive. To study the potential function of the polyA-minus RNAs in adipogenesis, a dynamic expressional profiling was performed in the induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In addition to identifying thousands of novel intergenic transcripts, differentiation-synchronized expression was characterized for many of them. Among these, several large intergenic transcripts were found to be upregulated by more than 19-fold during differentiation. Further study demonstrated a fat tissue-specific expression pattern for these regions and identified an adipogenesis-associated long non-coding RNA. Collectively, these lines of evidence contribute to the characterization of a super-long intergenic transcript functioning in adipogenesis. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84879108730	Gene transfection efficacy and biocompatibility of polycation/DNA complexes coated with enzyme degradable PEGylated hyaluronic acid	Coating the polycation/DNA binary complexes with PEGylated polyanions can improve long-circulation and biocompatibility invivo. However, it has been certificated PEG dilemma can reduces gene transfection efficiency because of inhibition in cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Herein, two PEGylated anionic polymers, PEGylated hyaluronic acid (HgP) and PEGylated polyglutamic acid (PGgP) were synthesized to coat the binary complexes of core-shell cationic polycaprolactone-graft-poly (N, N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) nanoparticles/DNA (NP-D). The effects of polyanion structure were evaluated in terms of particle size, zeta potential, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and transfect efficiency invitro and invivo. Invitro study illustrated that HgP coated complexes showed better efficiencies in both cell uptake and transfection than PGgP coated complexes. The coating of HgP on NP-D improved the biocompatibility without reduction in cell uptake and transfection efficacy, and resulted in higher accumulation and gene expression in tumor after IV injection. The success of HgP coating in overcoming PEG dilemma is attributed to the hyaluronic acid (HA)-receptor-mediated endocytosis and outer shell-detachment through the hyaluronidases catalyzed degradation of HA. These results demonstrated that HgP was a promising anionic polymer for coating the polycation/DNA complexes and ternary complexes (HgP coated NP-D) hold promising potential for cancer therapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrodes were designed as symmetrical hyperbolic formatted to generate linearly decrescent electric field. Cells were cultured on the microchip for adherent electroporation and in-situ observation. Exhibited diversely in cell viability and transfection efficiency, three areas were observed obviously since the intensity of electric field was varied. Assisted by markers designed on electrodes, the location of optimal electroporation performance area and the corresponding range of electric field intensity were determined. Using the proposed electroporation chip, we obtained the optimal electric field spectrum for electroporation of HEK-293A cell line, that was about 0.75 ∼ 1.25 × 10

84884288198	MALAT-1 interacts with hnRNP C in cell cycle regulation	As a conserved non-coding RNA gene, transcripts of MALAT-1 localize predominately in the nucleus. However in G2/M cell cycle phase, MALAT-1 transcripts were surprisingly found to translocate from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Investigation also found that in this process MALAT-1 interacts with an abundant nuclear factor, hnRNP C protein. Using a loss-of-function assay, we found that down-regulation of MALAT-1 expression compromised the cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNP C in the G2/M phase and resulted in G2/M arrest. In addition to characterize the physiological interaction between MALAT-1 and hnRNP C, our study also highlights the role of MALAT-1 in cell cycle regulation. © 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

84885147092	Single modification at position 14 of siRNA strand abolishes its gene-silencing activity by decreasing both RISC loading and target degradation	Normally siRNA has to be chemically stabilized in therapeutic applications. It is a challenge to obtain optimal stabilizing effects while maintaining full silencing activity due to a lack of understanding of how different chemical modifications would influence the efficacy of siRNA. In the current study, the effect of single 2-sugar modifications was profiled across the length of the siRNA guide strand. This led to the surprising finding that a single 2-OMe modification at position 14 of the siRNA guide strand substantially compromised its gene-silencing activity in a manner that was independent of the nucleotide identity at this site or the sequence context around it. We found that modification at position 14 of the siRNA guide strand reduced its RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading tremendously, whereas the loading of the siRNA sense strand was only marginally affected. When comparing the silencing potency of 14th position-modified siRNA (transfected at 16.7 nM) and native control (transfected at 1 nM) at equivalent Ago2 loading levels, the silencing potency of modified siRNA was much lower, even lower than the level of native siRNA transfected at 0.1 nM. These data indicated that modification at position 14 of the siRNA guide strand abolishes its gene-silencing activity by decreasing both RISC loading and target degradation. Using a computational modeling approach, we demonstrated an intimate interaction between the 14th nucleotide of guide strand and the amino acid Q675 in the AGO protein, which is located in a highly conserved loop of PIWI domain. In addition to gaining insights into siRNA-AGO interactions, this study of structure-activity relationship further established a general principle for siRNA modification in siRNA drug development. © FASEB.

84890080343	Polycation-detachable nanoparticles self-assembled from mPEG-PCL-g-SS-PDMAEMA for in vitro and in vivo siRNA delivery	Long circulation, cell internalization, endosomal escape and small interfering RNA (siRNA) release to the cytoplasm are the prerequisite considerations for siRNA delivery vectors. Herein, a kind of sheddable nanoparticles (NPs) with micelle architecture for siRNA delivery were fabricated by using an intracellular- activated polycation-detachable copolymer (PECssD), which was prepared by introducing highly reducing environment-responsive disulfide linkages between PEGylated polycaprolactone (PCL) and the grafted polycation, poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). The architecture of PECssD self-assembled NPs includes a biodegradable hydrophobic PCL core, a PEG shield and a detachable comb-like polycation surface. The stable nanosized complexes of PECssD NPs with siRNA, termed PECssD/ siRNA micelleplexes, were formed, which could prolong circulation, improve accumulation and retention in tumor tissue, and be favorable for internalization. In particular, the cleavage of the disulfide linkages in the intracellular microenvironment and the subsequent dissociation of the PDMAEMA/siRNA polyplexes from the PEGylated PCL cores of PECssD/siRNA micelleplexes were also confirmed, which facilitated the endosomal escape and the efficient release of siRNA. As a result, the distribution of siRNA in cytoplasm was enhanced and subsequently promoted the efficiency of siRNA in gene silencing. Furthermore, systemic administration of the NPs carrying siPlk1 (polo-like kinase 1 specific siRNA) induced a tumor-suppressing effect in the HeLa-Luc xenograft murine model. Therefore, the devised strategy of the polycation-detachable copolymer PECssD NPs could address the requirements of the multistep systemic delivery process of siRNA. The hydrophobic core of the PECssD/siRNA micelleplexes is expected to entrap antitumor drugs or other therapeutic agents for combined therapies. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

84888153117	Therapeutic RNA interference targeting CKIP-1 with a cross-species sequence to stimulate bone formation	Objectives: Casein kinase 2 interacting protein 1 (CKIP-1) is a newly discovered intracellular negative regulator of bone formation without affecting bone resorption. In this study, we aimed to identify a cross-species siRNA sequence targeting CKIP-1 to facilitate developing a novel RNAi-based bone anabolic drug for reversing established osteoporosis. Methods: Eight specifically designed cross-species CKIP-1 siRNA sequences were screened in human, rhesus, rat and mouse osteoblast-like cells in vitro to identify the optimal sequence with the highest knockdown efficiency. The effect of this optimal siRNA sequence on osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization was further examined in osteoblast-like cells across different species, followed by an immunogenicity assessment in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. The intra-osseous localization and silencing efficiency of the optimal siRNA were examined in vivo using a biophotonic system and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The RNAi-mediated cleavage of the CKIP-1 transcript was confirmed by rapid amplification of the 5' cDNA ends in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of the optimal siRNA sequence on osteogenic differentiation, bone turnover biomarkers, bone mass and micro-architecture parameters was investigated in healthy and osteoporotic rodents. Results: The CKIP-1 siRNA sequence (si-3) was identified as the optimal sequence, which consistently maintained CKIP-1 mRNA/protein expression at the lowest level across species in vitro. The si-3 significantly increased mRNA expression levels of osteoblast phenotypic genes and matrix mineralization across species without inducing an immunostimulatory activity in vitro. The intra-osseous localization and RNAi-mediated CKIP-1 silencing with high efficiency were confirmed in vivo. Periodic intravenous injections of si-3 promoted mRNA expression of osteoblast phenotypic genes, enhanced bone formation, increased bone mass and elevated serum level of bone formation marker without raising urine level of bone resorption marker in the healthy rodents. Moreover, the si-3 treatment promoted bone formation, improved trabecular micro-architecture and reversed bone loss in the osteoporotic mice. Conclusions: The identified optimal CKIP-1 siRNA sequence (si-3) could promote osteogenic differentiation across species in vitro, stimulate bone formation in the healthy rodents and reverse bone loss in the osteoporotic mice. © 2013.

Silicon MNA is proposed to penetrate the high-resistant stratum corneum, while a flexible parylene substrate is used to fit the natural shape of electroporated objects. The chip provides a sufficient electrical field beneath the skin for electroporation with low voltage, which is less likely to harm tissues. Using the proposed chip, we successfully achieved plasmid DNA expression and siRNA delivery in living tissue with low voltage (30-40V).

84900526573	Site-specific RNase A activity was dramatically reduced in serum from multiple types of cancer patients	Potent RNase activities were found in the serum of mammals but the physiological function of the RNases was never well illustrated, largely due to the caveats in methods of RNase activity measurement. None of the existing methods can distinguish between RNases with different target specificities. A systematic study was recently carried out in our lab to investigate the site-specificity of serum RNases on double-stranded RNA substrates, and found that serum RNases cleave double-stranded RNAs predominantly at 5′-U/A-3′ and 5′-C/A-3′ dinucleotide sites, in a manner closely resembling RNase A. Based on this finding, a FRET assay was developed in the current study to measure this site-specific serum RNase activity in human samples using a double stranded RNA substrate.

84907821922	A flexible microneedle array as low-voltage electroporation electrodes for in vivo DNA and siRNA delivery	In vivo electroporation is an appealing method to deliver nucleic acid into living tissues, but the clinical application of such a method was limited due to severe tissue damage and poor coverage of the tissue surface. Here we present the validation of a novel flexible microneedle array electrode (MNAE) chip, in which the microneedle array and the flexible substrate are integrated together to simultaneously facilitate low-voltage electroporation and accomplish good coverage of the tissue surface. The efficient delivery of both DNA and siRNA was demonstrated on mice. Upon penetrating the high-resistance stratum corneum, the electroporation voltage was reduced to about 35 V, which was generally recognized safe for humans. Also, a pathological analysis of the microneedle-electroporated tissues was carried out to thoroughly assess the skin damage, which is an important consideration in pre-clinical studies of electroporation devices. This MNAE constitutes a novel way of in vivo delivery of siRNA and DNA to certain tissues or organs with satisfactory efficiency and good adaptation to the tissue surface profile as well as minimum tissue damage, thus avoiding the disadvantages of existing electroporation methods.

84910619271	Flow-through cell electroporation microchip integrating dielectrophoretic viable cell sorting	Microfluidics based continuous cell electroporation is an appealing approach for high-throughput cell transfection, but cell viability of existing methods is usually compromised by adverse electrical or hydrodynamic effects. Here we present the validation of a flow-through cell electroporation microchip, in which dielectrophoretic force was employed to sort viable cells. By integrating parallel electroporation electrodes and dielectrophoresis sorting electrodes together in a simple straight microfluidic channel, sufficient electrical pulses were applied for efficient electroporation, and a proper sinusoidal electrical field was subsequently utilized to exclude damaged cells by dielectrophoresis. Thus, the difficulties for seeking the fine balance between electrotransfection efficiency and cell viability were steered clear. After careful investigation and optimization of the DEP behaviors of electroporated cells, efficient electrotransfection of plasmid DNA was demonstrated in vulnerable neuron cells and several hard-to-transfect primary cell types with excellent cell viability. This microchip constitutes a novel way of continuous cell transfection to significantly improve the cell viability of existing methodologies.

84913595858	Doping hydroxylated cationic lipid into PEGylated cerasome boosts in vivo siRNA transfection efficacy	The therapeutic application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) requires safe nanocarriers for specific and efficient delivery in vivo. Herein, PEGylated cationic cerasomes (PCCs) were fabricated by doping a cationic lipid with a hydroxyl group into nanohybrid cerasomes. Multiple properties of PCCs provide a solution to many of the limitations associated with current platforms for the delivery of siRNA. The polyorganosiloxane surface imparts PCCs with higher morphological stability than conventional liposomes. The PEGylation of the cationic cerasome could protect the cerasome nanoparticles from agglomeration and macrophage capture, reduce protein absorption, and consequently prolong the blood circulating time and enhance the siRNA delivery efficiency. In addition, incorporation of the lipid containing a hydroxyl group further facilitates endosome release. Moreover, PCCs were further used to transport siRNA into the cytosol primarily via endocytosis. When applied to systemic administration, PCCs have demonstrated effective delivery into the liver and preferential uptake by hepatocytes in mice, thereby leading to high siRNA gene-silencing activity. All these results show potential therapeutic applications of PCCs-mediated delivery of siRNA for liver diseases.

84921929541	Small indels induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in the 5′ region of microRNA lead to its depletion and Drosha processing retardance	MicroRNA knockout by genome editing technologies is promising. In order to extend the application of the technology and to investigate the function of a specific miRNA, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to deplete human miR-93 from a cluster by targeting its 5′ region in HeLa cells. Various small indels were induced in the targeted region containing the Drosha processing site and seed sequences. Interestingly, we found that even a single nucleotide deletion led to complete knockout of the target miRNA with high specificity. Functional knockout was confirmed by phenotype analysis. Furthermore, de novo microRNAs were not found by RNA-seq. Nevertheless, expression of the pri-microRNAs was increased. When combined with structural analysis, the data indicated that biogenesis was impaired. Altogether, we showed that small indels in the 5′ region of a microRNA result in sequence depletion as well as Drosha processing retard.
