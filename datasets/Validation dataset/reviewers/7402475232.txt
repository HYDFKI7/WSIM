27644565888	Simulation of ion noise in microwave tubes by two-dimensional particle-in-cell method	The ion noise in microwave tube is studied using two-dimensional particle-in-cell method. The fluctuation of the ion amount, which is the source of ion noise of the tube, is observed in the simulation process. It is found that the sufficient ions amount in drift tube and beam envelope scalloping appear to be responsible for ion noise after changing the gas pressure, magnetic focusing field, and drift tube length. A great number ions escape radially and their amount is about half of the beam electron when ion noise occurs. The number of secondary electron is less than that of the ion and beam electron; it affects the ion noise very slightly. There are two ways can be used for depressing the ion noise. The first is adjusting or increasing the magnetic focusing field in drift tube. The second is creating static electric field gradient to make the ions leave the interaction space quickly. © 2005 IEEE.

It is analyzed that the change of the structure parameter affects dispersion properties and interaction impedance. It shows that, dispersion property weakens and interaction impedance increases as the pitch L decreases. Though dispersion property weakens as the length of straight waveguide H increases, the interaction impedance still decreases. Therefore, short period is in favor of improving the high frequency properties of serpentine circular groove waveguide slow wave circuit, whereas the low interaction impedance of the circuit and interaction impedance can be improved by decreasing H properly. Because the serpentine groove waveguide combines the advantage of serpentine waveguide and groove waveguide, such as high heat scattering capacity, weak dispersion, easy fabrication, single mode transmission, lower losses and large dimension, it would be an excellent SWS in millimeter and sub-millimeter wave traveling-wave tubes (TWTs).

A dispersion equation of the tunneladder TWT was derived, and the small signal gain and the working phase velocity were computed. The results manifest that the gain of the tunneladder TWT is high, and the bandwidth is narrow. When the width of the channel varies from zero to the double of ring radius, the linear gain decreases within 1%. When the ring radius increases 10%, the linear gain decreases 57%. When the ridge height increases 10%, the linear gain increases 62%. Thus, the width of the channel plays a small role on small signal gain, but the height of the ridge and the ring radius affect small signal gain strongly.

As an all-metal slow-wave circuit, this structure is especially suited for use in millimetre-wave travelling wave tubes (TWTs) due to its advantages of large size, high manufacturing precision and good heat dissipation. The first part of this paper concerns the wave properties of this structure in vacuum. The influence of the geometrical dimensions on dispersion characteristics and coupling impedance is investigated. The theoretical results show that this structure has a very strong dispersion and the coupling impedance for the fundamental wave is several tens of ohms, but the coupling impedance for -1 space harmonic wave is much lower than that for the fundamental wave, so the risk of backward wave oscillation is reduced. Besides these, the CST microwave studio is also used to simulate the dispersion property of the SWS.

The unified dispersion equation of this structure is obtained by using an approximate field-theory analysis, in which the profile of the groove is approximately replaced by a series of rectangular steps, and the continued relation of the fields between two adjacent steps and the matching conditions at the interface between the groove region and central region are investigated. The dispersion characteristics of the disk-loaded structure obtained by modifying above results have been validated against those reported by Kesari et al. Meanwhile, the dispersion characteristics of arbitrary-shaped groove, such as the triangle-groove-loaded one are proved to agree well with Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio simulation. The results of numerical calculations of the dispersion relation shows that the adjustment of structure parameters led to the possibility of widening the straight-line portion of ω-β dispersion characteristics, which is required for wideband TWT performance in view of widening the bandwidth of resonance between the beam-mode and the waveguide-mode. Comparison of several different shape groove-loaded structures shows that the coaxial inverted trapezoid groove one shows the most potential application in wideband gyro-TWT because its transverse electric field is the greatest so that can interact effectively with the electron beam. © 2007 IEEE.

It is clearly shown that the influence of dielectric loss on RF characteristics is much larger at the millimeter frequency band than that at the microwave frequency band, especially on interaction impedance and attenuation constant. The general theory developed here has been further confirmed by comparing the results with those obtained elsewhere for some special cases. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

39749136068	Design of wide-band mode discriminator based on mode-selective coupling	With instantaneous and in situ characteristics, mode discriminators based on mode-selective coupling principles attract much attention, but their working bandwidth is restricted by the distribution of the equal distance between adjacent holes and the equal radius of all holes. Meanwhile, the equal-interval and unequal-radius distribution of holes can increase the bandwidth of the mode discriminators remarkably. Therefore, the basic theory, designing method and example of the mode discriminators based on the equal-interval and unequal-intensity (i.e. various radii of holes) coupling are brought forward in this paper. The formulas of coupling intensity in terms of binomial distribution and Chebyshev distribution are also presented. The calculation shows that the working bandwidth of the mode discriminators based upon mode-selective coupling according to binomial distribution or Chebyshev distribution can reach 15% to 19%, which is twice over that of equal-interval and equal-intensity coupling mode discriminators.

After investigation of the interaction mechanisms of different slow-wave structures, the rectangular waveguide grating SWS has attracted the scholar's interest due to some of its peculiarities: the scalability to smaller dimensions and shorter wavelengths, high precession of manufacturing and assembling, super thermal conductivity and low loss, which make it worth consideration, especially at millimeter-wave frequency-band. From the investigation of the different structures, such as V-type, cosine-type, dovetail-type, etc., the cosine-shaped groove SWS has the weakest dispersion and the widest bandwidth.

A longitudinal cross section configuration is shown in Fig. 1. s is the width at the mouth of the groove, L is the period and L=s, b and p are waveguide height and groove depth, respectively. The width of the rectangular waveguide is represented by a. Expressed in terms of rectangular coordinates, the space of the rectangular waveguide grating SWS with cosine-shape grooves can be divided into two parts: interaction region I and groove region II. By means of an approximate field-theory analysis, the expressions of dispersion equation and coupling impedance are derived.

As shown in Fig. 2, the smooth curve represents the theoretical results, and the triangular points demonstrate the results given by CST simulations. It is obvious that the CST simulation data are in agreement with the theoretical results, which support our theory. (Graph Presented) Finally, numerical calculation shows that the bandwidth of the cosine-shaped groove SWS is much wider than that of rectangular-shaped groove one. And reducing the groove-width can broaden the frequency-band and decrease phase-velocity, while increasing the groove-depth can also decrease phase-velocity.

A complex function is derived and potential sinking effect is also considered. Thus, a set of more practical self-consistent equations of nonlinear beam-wave interaction is formulated. Simulations are carried out under the conditions of the two different physical models, and the simulation results are compared with the experimental data. The results show that in the case of single signal drive, the unknown second harmonic should be included for predicting the saturated output power. It is also evident that the SATT model and the HATT model predict the same physical nature, whereas the results predicted by the HATT model are much closer to the experimental data than those obtained from the SATT model.

The simulated results show that the rectangular helical slow-wave structure has higher coupling impedance, smaller size in a traveling wave tube (TWT) than that of a circular one. Moreover, at the given height and helix pitch, when the height/width ratio of the rectangular helical slow-wave structure is greater than 4 i. e. b/a>4, the phase velocity remains unchanged. However, the coupling impedance decreases with an increase of its width. In addition, the phase velocity and the operating voltage can be favorably decreased by reducing the pitch angle.

This paper studies the stable sheet-beam transport in periodic nonsymmetric quadrupole field. First, the conditions for stable round- and sheet-beam transport in periodic magnetic quadrupole field are deduced. In the deduction, we find that the symmetric quadrupole field and the space-charge field of sheet beam are not well matched. In order to settle this problem, we use periodic nonsymmetric quadrupole field instead of periodic symmetric quadrupole field to transport sheet beam.
