33750081803	A systematic bit-wise decomposition of M -ary symbol metric	In this paper, we present a systematic recursive formula for bit-wise decomposition of M-ary symbol metric. The decomposed bit metrics can be applied to improve the performance of a system where the information sequence is binarycoded and interleaved before M-ary modulated. A traditional receiver designed for certain system is to de-map the received M-ary symbol into its binary isomorphism so as to facilitate the subsequent bit-based manipulation, such as hard-decision decoding. With a bit-wise decomposition of M-ary symbol metric, a soft-decision decoder can be used to achieve a better system performance. The idea behind the systematic formula is to decompose the symbol-based maximum-likelihood (ML) metric by equating a number of specific equations that are drawn from squarederror criterion. It interestingly yields a systematic recursive formula that can be applied to some previous work derived from different standpoint. Simulation results based on IEEE 802.11a/g standard show that at bit-error-rate of 10

33750258790	Wear resistant and anti-corrosive treatment for TI-6AL-4V using metal vapor vacuum arc source in comparison with plasma immersion ion implantation	This study utilizes two ion-implantation methods, plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) and metal vapor vacuum arc (MeVVA), to prepare Ti-N phases on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V. By the nitrogen PIII method, both nitrogen and minor oxygen species are simultaneously attracted by the negatively charged substrate. The penetration of N and O interstitial elements to an extensible depth is possible owing to the effect from the negatively charged target. The nitrogen PIII treatment does not produce a novel Ti-N phase. As a result, the modified surface does not behave anticorrosive. The H

0032690125	Developing an integrated intelligent framework to support an engineering change process for an axial piston pump	Since the concepts of concurrent engineering were introduced in mid 1980s, the product design process has become complicated. This is because many factors related to the life cycle of the product may need to be considered during the design stage. Therefore, shortening product development time becomes important for the survival of an enterprise. In this paper, an integral intelligent environment to support concurrent engineering is proposed. Two major modules are provided by this system to assist change management. One is a constraint network module that analyses the related constraints about a design change to find the design variables influenced. Another is a product assembly module that extracts the design data from a CAD database to analyse the spatial relationships relating to an assembly. The data in the above two modules are integrated in a data integrated module, in which an entity relational data model was developed to describe the integrated data. Finally, a web-based query system was developed to provide a multiplatform environment for the user to refer to the data in the constraint network module and the product assembly module during a design change process. The proposed environment is implemented in the design change process for an axial piston pump.

60449109151	LC-tank colpitts injection-locked frequency divider with even and odd modulo	A new injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) using a standard 0.18 μm CMOS process is presented. The ILFD is based on a differential Colpitts voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with a direct injection MOSFET for coupling an external signal to the resonators. The VCO is composed of two single-ended VCOs coupled with two transformers. Measurement results show that at the supply voltage of 1.4 V the divider's free-running frequency is tunable from 4.77 to 5.08 GHz, and the proposed circuit can function as a first harmonic injection-locked oscillator, divide-by-2, -3, and -4 frequency divider.

The nano-indentation tip-on-cell approaches took advantage of finding a contact surface, followed by obtaining a continuous nano-mechanical profile along the nano-indentation depths. In the experiment, serial indentations from the leading edge, i.e., the lamellipodium to nucleus regions of living, fixed and dehydrated fibroblast cells were examined. Nano-indentations on a living cell anchored upon glass substrate were competent in finding the tip-on-cell contact surfaces and cell heights. For the result on the fixed and the dehydrated cells, cellular nano-mechanical properties were clearly characterized by continuous harmonic contact stiffness(HCS) measurements. The relations of HCS versus measured displacement, varied from the initial tip-on-cell contact to the glass substrate, were presumably divided into three stages, respectively induced by cellular intrinsic behavior, the substrate-dominant property, and the substrate property. This manifestation is beneficial to elucidate how the underlying substrate influences the interpretation of the nano-mechanical property of thin soft matter on a hard substrate. These findings, based upon continuous depth-sensing nano-indentations, are presumably valuable as a reference to related work, e.g., accomplished by atomic force microscopy. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

79952310281	Formation of polycrystalline thin-film transistors with stacked poly-SiGe/poly-Si channel layer for low-voltage applications	A thin-film transistor (TFT) with polycrystalline SiGe/Si stacked channel layer has been proposed for low-voltage applications. For the stacked poly-SiGe/poly-Si channel layer, the resultant 1-μm TFT device can achieve an on/off current ratio above 7 orders and a relatively large on-state current at a low operating voltage, and also cause better transfer characteristics than both the conventional poly-Si and poly-SiGe channel layers. As compared to the poly-Si channel layer, the poly-SiGe channel layer may cause a larger on-state current at a small gate bias of 3 V, due to smaller difference between conduction band and intrinsic level. However, even at a small drain bias of 3 V, the poly-SiGe channel layer leads to an off-state leakage current of about 2 order larger than the poly-Si channel layer, since a smaller energy bandgap may cause more carrier field emission via trap states. As a result, when a poly-SiGe/poly-Si stacked channel layer is employed, the leakage current may be suppressed to a low level as that for the poly-Si channel layer, and the resultant on-state current at a low gate bias voltage can be close to a relatively high level as that for the poly-SiGe channel layer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80052568795	Gold nanorod stabilized by thiolated chitosan as photothermal absorber for cancer cell treatment	Gold nanorod (GNR) has great potential in the field of cancer therapy because of its photophysical property in converting near-infrared (NIR) laser light into heat. Fabrication of GNRs by seedmediated growth method with the aid of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is a popular approach. However, due to high cytotoxicity of CTAB, it is necessary to modify the surface of CTAB-passivated GNRs for cell-related studies. In this study, thiolated chitosan was synthesized and harnessed to replace CTAB originally used to stabilize GNRs. The average size and morphological shape of CTAB-passivated GNRs (66.0 nm) and thiolated chitosan-modified GNRs (CGNRs) (84.9 nm) were determined by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to confirm the existence of Au-S binding energy at 162.4 eV. Cytotoxicity study revealed that CGNRs were much biocompatible than CTAB-stabilized GNRs. Our results showed that CGNRs functionalized with folic acid (FA) could be internalized by human colon HT-29 cancer cells via folate-mediated endocytosis. From the viability of CGNR-laden HT-29 cells irradiated with 808-nm NIR laser light, we demonstrated that CGNR is a potential photothermal nano-absorber for the ablation of malignant cells under NIR laser exposure. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

84867299600	Reducing test point overhead with don't-cares	Test points provide additional control to design logic and can improve circuit testability. Traditionally, test points are activated by a global test enable signal, and routing the signal to the test points can be costly. To address this problem, we propose a new test point structure that utilizes controllability don't-cares to generate local test point activation signals. To support the structure, we propose new methods for extracting don't-cares from assertions and finite state machines in the design. Our empirical evaluation shows that don't-cares exist in many designs and can be used for reducing test point overhead. © 2012 IEEE.

84867062937	Efficient measurement procedure for handover in LTE femtocell networks	In LTE (Long Term Evolution) femtocell networks, user equipment (UE) has to measure all the eNBs and Home eNBs (HeNBs) in the Measurement Configuration and find a suitable eNB (or HeNB) to hand over to. However, there are many HeNBs under the coverage of one eNB. In other words, the UE has to measure all the eNBs and HeNBs, no matter whether they are in or out of range. In addition, in many urban areas, the indoor signal strength of LTE networks is fairly good due to the dense deployment of eNBs. As a consequence, the source eNB will not ask the UE entering the coverage of an HeNB to perform the measurement procedure because the source eNB can still provide a desirable signal strength. In this case, the UE will still camp on the eNB, and the HeNB is therefore idle. In this paper, we propose an efficient measurement procedure for handover in LTE femtocell networks to solve the two above-mentioned problems. The simulation results show that the measurement overhead and the average idle time are significantly reduced. © 2012 IEEE.

47249154693	Nano-indentation at the surface contact level: Applying a harmonic frequency for measuring contact stiffness of self-assembled monolayers adsorbed on Au	In this study, the well-ordered alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of varied chain lengths and tail groups were employed as examples for nano-characterization on their mechanical properties. A novel nano-indentation technique with a constant harmonic frequency was applied on SAMs chemically adsorbed on Au to explore their contact mechanics, and furthermore to interpret how SAM molecules respond to an infinitesimal oscillation force without pressing them. Experimental results demonstrated that the harmonic contact stiffness along with the measured displacement of SAMs/Au was distinguishable using a dynamic contact modulus with the distinct feature of phase angles. Phase angles resulted from the relaxing continuation of an applied harmonic frequency and mostly influenced by the outermost tail group of SAM molecules. The harmonic contact stiffness of SAM molecules obviously increased with the densely packed alkyl chains and relatively intense agglomeration of the head group at the anchoring site. As a consequence, the result of this work is relevant to contact mechanics at the surface contact level for the distinction of molecular substances attached on a solid surface. Furthermore it is particularly anticipated to identify biological molecules of variable qualities under a fluid-like micro-environment. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

54349113528	Cells anchored upon a thin organic film with different nano-mechanical properties	By applying dynamic contact module and particular measurement of phase angles, harmonic contact stiffness (S) along with the measured displacement (D) of different self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) adsorbed on Au can be distinguished. The relatively ordered and hydrophobic ODT and DDT molecules adsorbed on Au form high contact stiffness, which are presumably unfavorable substrates for a cell to adhere upon. Short-chain MUA molecules adsorbed on Au provides a hydrophilic characteristic with a relatively low contact stiffness, which may significantly promote cell adhesion. It is, therefore, estimated that the behavior of a cell adhered on SAMs/Au is correlated not only with their outermost chemical species but also with a proper dS/dD matrix acting as a cushion. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

65549121219	Ultra-thin phospholipid layers physically adsorbed upon glass characterized by nano-indentation at the surface contact level	Dipalmitoylphosphatic acid was chosen as a model to interpret how molecules physically adsorbed upon glass responded to an infinitesimal oscillation force at the surface contact level. Oscillation of a nano-indentation tip toward the phospholipid layers was driven by a dynamic contact module at a constant harmonic frequency; the phase angle of the oscillation frequency was exponentially relaxed along the nano-scale displacement. The tip-on-molecule contact was thereafter identified and influenced by the characteristic of the physically adsorbed phospholipids. By applying the harmonic displacement of the nano-indentation tip and making a distinction between full contact displacements, the thickness of the phospholipid layers was thereafter estimated. Moreover, the additional force required to penetrate through the physically adsorbed molecules was minor compared to the analogous process for the chemically adsorbed ones. The importance of recognizing the physically adsorbed molecules is relevant to applications of contact mechanics for the distinction of various phospholipids. Furthermore it is very promising to interpret the mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical responses on the channels of phospholipids. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

65649103784	Cell adhesion over two distinct surfaces varied with chemical and mechanical properties	Chitosan is widely recognized as a natural and proper scaffold material; however, as a base substrate, it shows little promotion effect for the growth of cultured fibroblast cells. In this study, chitosan in a film form was prepared and used as a cell-culturing matrix, followed by patterning the evaporated Au upon it. Micro-scale Au clusters of ≈ 150 μm in diameter and ≈ 20 nm in thickness were then patterned and adhered upon the chitosan matrix. Physical and chemical properties of Au/chitosan were characterized. In particular, nano-indentation with dynamic contact module was applied to measure the nano-hardness of the tailored surfaces on Au/chitosan. Fibroblast cells were thereafter cultured on Au/chitosan. Experimental results demonstrated that as compared with the chitosan matrix, Au clusters and their boundary area exhibited favorable to promote cell adhesion, spreading, and growth. As well, nano-hardness on the boundary area of Au/chitosan significantly enhanced, while the cultured fibroblast cells aggregated upon Au clusters and the boundary area. In combination with the possible chemical and mechanical changes resulted by the evaporation of Au clusters upon the chitosan matrix, a selectively-enhanced Au/chitosan to promote fibroblast cells proliferation was created.

Exploration of alternative therapeutic modalities is needed. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), revealing optical absorbance in the near-infrared region, warrant their merits in photothermal therapy. In order to specifically target disialoganglioside (GD2) overexpressed on the surface of neuroblastoma stNB-V1 cells, GD2 monoclonal antibody (anti-GD2) was conjugated to acidified CNTs. To examine the fate of anti-GD2 bound CNTs after incubation with stNB-V1 cells, rhodamine B was labeled on carboxylated CNTs functionalized with and without anti-GD2. Our results illustrated that anti-GD2-linked CNTs were extensively internalized by neuroblastoma cells via GD2-mediated endocytosis. In addition, we showed that anti-GD2 bound CNTs were not ingested by PC12 cells without GD2 expression. After anti-GD2 conjugated CNTs were incubated with neuroblastoma cells for 6h and endocytosed by the cells, CNT-laden neuroblastoma cells were further irradiated with an 808nm near-infrared (NIR) laser with intensity ramping from 0.6 to 6Wcm

76649144478	Formation of sub-micrometer polycrystalline-SiGe thin-film transistors by using a thinned channel layer	A sub-micron poly-SiGe TFT device, operating at a drain bias of 1.5 V, is proposed by using a thinned channel layer. A thinner channel layer may lead to better good gate control over the entire channel region. Hence, a thinner channel layer may lead to better on-state conduction at low operation voltage, but sustain larger vertical electric field under negative gate bias. A thinned channel layer can reduce the source/drain bulk punch-through, thus causing a smaller channel region with relatively high electric field for carrier field emission. With using a low drain bias of 1.5 V, for the poly-SiGe TFT device with a thinner channel layer, in spite of the more enhanced vertical electric field, the leakage current would be more effectively suppressed primarily due to the resultantly smaller channel region with relatively high electric field for carrier field emission. As a result, even for a gate length of 0.5 μm, the poly-SiGe TFT device with 20-nm channel layer can cause an off-state leakage of about 10 pA/μm at a drain bias of 1.5 V, and an on/off current ratio of about seven orders can be achieved. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77953338267	In situ formation of viruses tagged with quantum dots	Quantum dots (QDs) have great potential for applications in bio-related fields, due to their high photoluminescence, photochemical stability and size-dependent emission. QDs used for the construction of QD-virus hybrids can be harnessed as an imaging probe to reveal viral infection pathways and screen antiviral agents. In the study, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transfected with three plasmids, pSIN-EGFP, pMDG, and p8.91, to produce lentiviruses which can make infected cells express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The QDs employed were CdSe-ZnS semiconductor nanocrystals emitting red fluorescence. The QD-virus hybrids, constructed as lentiviruses, were budding from the membrane surface of HEK 293T producer cells on which QDs encapsulated with alkylated chitosan (chitosan-QDs) were pre-adsorbed via electrostatic attraction force. Such in situ formation of QD-virus hybrids was confirmed by TEM micrographs indicating the lentivirus was capped with chitosan-modified QDs. To further illustrate the effectiveness (i.e., infectivity and photoluminescence) of the constructed QD-virus hybrids, NIH 3T3 cells were infected with the in situ fabricated QD-virus hybrids. Our results showed QDs were indeed entering NIH 3T3 cells along with lentiviruses as hybrids. Moreover, photoluminescence and infectivity of QD-virus hybrids remained intact, as compared to QDs and lentivirus alone. The unique approach of constructing QD-virus hybrids taking advantage of the viral budding process offers a feasible tool to create enveloped virus incorporated with nanomaterials for the study of fundamental and applied virology. ©2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

78649592406	Authentication and protection for medical image	This paper proposes a method to authenticate and protect medical images, especially in the region of interest (ROI). The ROI of a medical image is an important area during diagnosis and must not be distorted during transmission and storage in the hospital information system. The rest of the ROI is used for embedding a watermark that contains the patients data and authentication information, and the authentication information is generated from the ROI by analyzing wavelet coefficients with singular value decomposition (SVD), before embedding the watermark into the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) sub-band. It is important that the ratio of ROI and non-ROI areas is consistent between different systems and doctors, and this ratio is analyzed in this paper. The ROI of watermarked medical image is fragile to any distortion, and patients data and authentication information can be easily extracted from non-ROI. The effectiveness of the new approach is demonstrated empirically. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79955106616	Fabrication of nano-indented cavities on Au for the detection of chemically-adsorbed DTNB molecular probes through SERS effect	Micro/nano-lithographic techniques are usually employed as a straightforward process for roughening a thin-film Au surface for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). However, a topographical pattern with deepened edges is difficult to control in a rapid and environmental-friendly way. In this study, a simple physical procedure is proposed for tailoring a thin-film Au surface with triangular nanostructures using nano-indentation technique. The as-fabricated nano-indented cavities on Au (nAu) were structured as a characterization substrate for SERS. By calculating the geometries of nAu and the increase of surface area as a function of the concentration of chemically adsorbed 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (NTB), a combined chemical and electromagnetic effect was estimated. Particularly-made nAu was adjusted for examining chemically adsorbed NTB molecules with differently intensified Raman-active groups by tuning the indentation depth and the tip-to-tip displacement.

79953276093	Focused ion beam-fabricated Au micro/nanostructures used as a surface enhanced Raman scattering-active substrate for trace detection of molecules and influenza virus	The focused ion beam (FIB) technique was used to precisely fabricate patterned Au micro/nanostructures (fibAu). The effects of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) on the fibAu samples were investigated by adjusting the geometrical, dimensional, and spacing factors. The SERS mechanism was evaluated using low-concentration rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules, physically adsorbed or suspended on/within the micro/nanostructures. The results indicated that for detecting R6G molecules, hexagon-like micro/nanostructures induced a higher electromagnetic mechanism (EM) due to the availability of multiple edges and small curvature. By decreasing the dimensions from 300 to 150nm, the laser-focused area contained an increasing number of micro/nanostructures and therefore intensified the excitation of SERS signals. Moreover, with an optimized geometry and dimensions of the micro/nanostructures, the relative intensity/surface area value reached a maximum as the spacing was 22nm. An exponential decrease was found as the spacing was increased, which most probably resulted from the loss of EM. The spacing between the micro/nanostructures upon the fibAu was consequently regarded as the dominant factor for the detection of R6G molecules. By taking an optimized fibAu to detect low-concentration influenza virus, the amino acids from the outermost surface of the virus can be well distinguished through the SERS mechanism. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

79955971845	Improved model of rectangular scratch drive actuator	This paper proposes an integrated model of a scratch drive actuator (SDA) based on a fourth-order governing equation of the Euler-Bernoulli theory. By solving this equation with proper boundary conditions, typical SDA output characteristics, such as noncontact length, priming voltage, deflection curve, output force, and bending stress, can be determined. The results of the output force in a static model are then used as the input of single degree-of-freedom dynamic SDA model to investigate the friction effect. Electroplated nickel SDA arrays, 80 m in main beam length and 65 m in width with a suspended spring, are fabricated and tested. The average travel distances after 1500 input pulses of 80-120 V are measured and found to be from 4.7 to 12.9 m. The average measured output forces are from 10.2 to 28.3 μN. The simulation from the dynamic model is closer to the measured total travel distance and the output force than the static model, in general. The difference between simulations and experimental data due to energy dissipation can be reduced by including the friction effect in the dynamic model. Deviations between simulations and measured results are less than 10 in full range showing the superior capability of the proposed SDA model. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

79957548552	Formal reset recovery slack calculation at the register transfer level	Reset is one of the most important signals in many designs. Since reset is typically not timing critical, it is handled at late physical design stages. However, the large fanout of reset and the lack of routing resources at these stages can create variant delays on different targets of the reset signal, creating reset recovery problems. Traditional approaches address this problem using physical design methods such as buffer insertion or rerouting. However, these methods may invalidate previous optimization efforts, making timing closure difficult. In this work we propose a formal method to calculate reset recovery slacks for registers at the register transfer level. Designers and physical design tools can then utilize this information throughout the design flow to reduce reset problems at later design stages. © 2011 EDAA.

79959192827	Constraint generation for software-based post-silicon bug masking with scalable resynthesis technique for constraint optimization	Due to the dramatic increase in design complexity, verifying the functional correctness of a circuit is becoming more difficult. Therefore, bugs may escape all verification efforts and be detected after tape-out. While most existing solutions focus on fixing the problem on the hardware, in this work we propose a different methodology that tries to generate constraints which can be used to mask the bugs using software. This is achieved by utilizing formal reachability analysis to extract the conditions that can trigger the bugs. By synthesizing the bug conditions, we can derive input constraints for the software so that the hardware bugs will never be exposed. In addition, we observe that such constraints have special characteristics: they have small onset terms and flexible minterms. To facilitate the use of our methodology, we also propose a novel resynthesis technique to reduce the complexity of the constraints. In this way, software can be modified to run correctly on the buggy hardware, which can improve system quality without the high cost of respin. © 2011 IEEE.

81455137665	Enabling virtual wafer CD (WCD) using Inverse Pattern Rendering (IPR) of mask CD-SEM images	A wafer's printed CD error can be impacted by unaccounted mask making process variation. Unaccounted mask CD and/or corner rounding alters the intended drawn mask pattern contributing to a wafer's printed CD error. During OPC wafer calibration, average mask bias and corner rounding are accounted for in the OPC model, but random local mask making process variations or mask-to-mask variations can be difficult to account in such model calibration. Thus when a wafer's CD has error, it can be difficult to determine if the general root cause was due to mask or wafer or both. An in-line monitoring application has been developed to extract accurate mask CD and rendered mask polygon from collected mask CD-SEM images. Technical information will be presented on the challenges of accurately extracting information from SEM images. In particular, discussions include SEM image calibration, contour extraction, inverse pattern rendering, and general image processing to account for mask SEM aberrations (translation, rotation, & dilation), tool-to-tool variation, vendor-to-vendor variation, run-to-run variation, and dark/bright field pattern-to-pattern variation. After accurate mask SEM contours are obtained, lithographic simulations are performed on extracted polygon contours to determine the impact of mask variation on wafer CD. This paper will present detail information about the Inverse Pattern Rendering (IPR) capabilities developed for a virtual Wafer CD (WCD) application and its results, which is proven to achieved 0.5 nm accuracy across multiple critical layers from 28 nm to 40 nm nodes on multiple CD-SEM tools over multiple mask shop locations. © 2011 SPIE.

81555219373	Thermal diffusion of Co into sputtered ZnO:Co thin film for enhancing visible-light-induced photo-catalytic activity	ZnO has received a lot of attention in for the degradation and complete mineralization of environmental pollutants. In this study, efficient ZnO-based visible-light photocatalysts are synthesized via a low-cost method by increasing the Co concentration at the outermost surface of ZnO:Co thin film under an annealing process. The simply adjusted Co concentration gradient (≈1.5% increase) into the surface of ZnO:Co is driven by thermal diffusion. Co ions substitute Zn sites in the ZnO lattice. The band gap narrowed due to sp-d exchange interactions between the conduction band electrons and the d electrons of Co. The annealing process enhances the grain size and the degree of crystallinity of the diffused Co/ZnO:Co, which contributes to the absorption edge red-shift. Photocatalytic activities such as the photo-degradation of methylene blue and the inactivation of bacteria are obviously enhanced.

83455210669	Applying verification intention for design customization via property mining under constrained testbenches	Most synthesis tools perform optimizations based on the design itself and do not utilize the information present in the verification environment. Not using such information greatly limits the optimization capabilities of synthesis tools, which is especially serious for circuit customization because most environment constraints are encoded in the testbench. To exploit verification intention, we propose a methodology that utilizes functional assertions for design optimization. To support circuit customization, we also propose a property mining technique that can extract properties from the design under the constraints in the testbench. Our experimental results show that these methods can reduce design size after synthesis, and the optimization is orthogonal to other existing circuit customization methods. © 2011 IEEE.

84858992747	Enhanced photovoltaic performance with co-sensitization of porphyrin and an organic dye in dye-sensitized solar cells	We designed a stepwise approach for co-sensitization of a zinc porphyrin sensitizer (LD12) with a spirally configured organic dye (CD5) for dye-sensitized solar cells. The co-sensitized LD12 + CD5 device showed significantly enhanced V<inf>OC</inf> and J<inf>SC</inf> relative to its individual single-dye sensitized devices. Upon optimization, the device made of the LD12 + CD5 system yielded J<inf>SC</inf>/mA cm<sup>-2</sup> = 16.7, V <inf>OC</inf>/V = 0.74, FF = 0.73 and η = 9.0%; this performance is superior to that of either individual device made from LD12 (η = 7.5%) and CD5 (η = 5.7%) under the same conditions of fabrication. To understand the effects of the potential shift and charge recombination on the cell performance, we measured charge-extraction (CE) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectra (IMVS). Upon sensitization with each dye, the TiO<inf>2</inf> potentials are similar, but co-sensitization causes the potential to shift down (cathodic shift). Charge recombination was significantly retarded for the co-sensitized system relative to each individual dye-sensitized system, to account for the enhanced V<inf>OC</inf> for the former relative to the latter. A test of stability indicates a systematic trend between the LD12 + CD5 and LD12 devices; the performance of the co-sensitized device degraded only ∼15% and remained stable during the period of 500-1000 h near 295 K. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84859906043	Study of polycrystalline-Si thin-film transistors with different channel layer thickness at low bias voltage	A sub-micron poly-Si TFT device, operating at a drain bias of 1.5 V, has been studied with respect to channel layer thickness. A thinner channel layer may lead to better good gate control over the entire channel region, thus resulting in a lower threshold voltage. Similarly, under negative gate bias, a thinner channel layer would sustain larger vertical electric field. However, a thinned channel layer can reduce the source/drain bulk punch-through, thus causing a smaller channel region with relatively high electric field for carrier field emission. With using a low drain bias of 1.5 V, for the poly-Si TFT device with a thinner channel layer, the leakage current would be more effectively suppressed by the resultantly smaller channel region with relatively high electric field for carrier field emission. As a result, even for a gate length of 0.5 μm, the poly-Si TFT device with 20-nm channel layer can cause an off-state leakage of about 0.1 pA/μm at a drain bias of 1.5 V, and an on/off current ratio higher than 8 orders can be achieved. © 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84863959277	Sulphate-activated growth of bamboo-like carbon nanotubes over copper catalysts	A sulphate-activated mechanism is proposed to describe the growth of bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) over copper catalysts using chemical vapour deposition with helium-diluted ethylene. Sulphate-assisted copper catalysts afford a high-yield growth of bamboo-like CNTs at a mild temperature, 800°C; however, non-sulphate-assisted copper catalysts, e.g., copper acetate and copper nitrate prepared catalysts, were inert to CNT growth and only gave amorphous carbons (a-C) surrounding copper nanoparticles under the same conditions. Nevertheless, the addition of sulphate ions in the preparation step for the two inert catalysts can activate their abilities for CNT growth with remarkable yields. Furthermore, Raman spectra analysis demonstrates a linear dependence between the concentration of sulphate ions in copper catalysts and the ratio of CNT-a-C in the as-grown carbon soot. The sulphate-activated effect on CNT growth over copper catalysts could be related to a three-way interaction of sulphate ions, copper nanoparticles and support. In situ TEM images of an as-grown CNT irradiated by electron beams without the inlet of carbon sources reveal a new pathway of carbon diffusion through the bulk of copper nanoparticles and an enlarged inner-wall thickness of the on-site CNT. This carbon diffusion model over copper catalysts can provide new insights into the CNT growth mechanism over non-magnetic metal catalysts. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

In parallel-tuned single-resonance ILFD, the output phase noise is set by the noise of the injection signal at low frequency offset from the carrier, while it can be dominated by the divider noise at large frequency offset.

84867156106	An efficient algorithm for protecting and authenticating medical image	With the advance in the medical image from photographic film (analogy) to digital file, how to avoid medical image modified by malice and hide the patient's information into their medical image has become the promising research issue. It is difficult to embed the information of patient to medical images because most pixels of this kind of images are close to black or white. In this paper, an effective method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is presented to hide the patient's information into medical images which can be used to protect and authenticate their images, called Non-ROI Hidding Algorithm (NRHA). More precisely, the SVD is first employed to find the features of medical image, and then the information of patient will be hidden in the non-ROI area of the image. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we use it to hide the information of patient to several digital medical images. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method can be used to avoid malicious attacks because it provides an effective way to distinguish good images from malicious ones. As a result, the patient information can be protected by using the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.

84868139212	Spatially reinforced nano-cavity array as the SERS-active substrate for detecting hepatitis virus core antigen at low concentrations	Proteomic analysis of biological specimens is of the utmost importance in disease monitoring and containment systems. However, current methodologies require time-consuming incubation steps to obtain clearly isolated target species. To reduce the diagnostic procedures, spectroscopy technologies with the enhanced signal intensity on the target molecules have been growingly developed. In this work, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique employed fingerprints for sensing Raman-active molecules. Spatially reinforced Au nano-cavity array (SR-nAu) samples with a reduced tip-to-tip displacement are SERS-active and can be used to recognize bovine serum albumin (BSA), hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBV-cAg), and hepatitis C virus core antigen (HCV-cAg) at low concentrations. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (CBBG) concentration- dependent SERS spectra of CBBG-BSA and CBBG-antigen complexes at very low concentrations reveal a linear relationship of SERS intensities of CBBG in CBBG-BSA and CBBG-antigen complexes with respect to different BSA, HBV-cAg, and HCV-cAg concentrations could be clearly found. The as-designed SR-nAu samples are highly proficient in recognizing the protein biomarkers of highly similar chemical structures and can be used for determining the quantity of protein at low concentrations. The SR-nAu substrate is therefore promising for a rapid, high-sensitivity, and high-throughput diagnosis on proteins. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84871748807	An oblivious routing algorithm for 3D mesh networks to achieve a new worst-case throughput bound	1/2 network capacity is often believed to be the limit of worst-case throughput for three-dimension (3D) mesh networks. However, this paper provides a new worst-case throughput bound, which is higher than 1/2 network capacity, for odd radix 3D mesh networks. In addition, we propose a routing algorithm called uniform solo-minimal (USM) routing that can achieve this new worst-case throughput bound in odd radix mesh networks. For the even radix case, we prove that USM achieves the optimal worst-case throughput, namely, half of network capacity. USM considers all routing paths with at most one dimensional minimal-distance routing and distributes the traffic loads uniformly to other two left dimensions. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that USM outperforms existing routing algorithms in worst-case throughput. Moreover, USM achieves good average-throughput and performs very well under different traffic matrices at the expense of (5/3)× minimal average hop count. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

84871170922	Probability-based cloud storage providers selection algorithms with maximum availability	During recent years cloud service providers have successfully provided reliable and flexible resources to cloud users. For example Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides users storage in the cloud. Despite the tremendous efforts cloud service providers have devoted to the availability of their services, the interruption is still inevitable. Therefore just as an Internet service provider will not count on a single network provider, a cloud user should not depend on a single cloud service provider either. However, cloud service providers provide different levels of services. A more costly service is usually more reliable. As a result it is an important and challenging problem to choose among a set of service providers to fit one's need, which could be budget, failure probability, or the amount of data that can survive failure. The goal of this paper is to select cloud service providers in order to maximize the benefits with a given budget. The contributions of this paper include a mathematical formulation of the cloud service provider selection problem in which both the object functions and cost measurements are clearly defined, algorithms that selects among cloud storage providers to maximize the data survival probability or the amount of surviving data, subject to a fixed budget, and a series of experiments that demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are efficient enough to find optimal solutions in reasonable amount of time, using price and fail probability taken from real cloud providers. © 2012 IEEE.

The edge detective technique predicts luma-4×4, luma-16×16, and chroma-8×8 modes directly. We partition the intra prediction procedure into two steps. At the first step, we use the pre-processing mode selection algorithms to find the primary mode which is selected for fast prediction. At the second step, the selected fewer high-potential candidate modes are applied to calculate the RD cost for the mode decision. Simulation results show that the proposed BMA method reduces the encoding time by 75%, and requires bit-rate increase about 2% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) decrease about 0.07 dB in QCIF and CIF sequences, compared with the H.264/AVC JM 14.2 software. The methods achieve less PSNR degradation and bit-rate increase than the previous methods with more encoding time reduction.

To recover a foggy image, an accurate depth map is estimated from a multi-level estimation method, which fuses depth maps with different sizes of patches by dark channel prior. Markov random field (MRF) is applied to label the depth level in adjacent region for the compensation of wrong estimated regions. The accurate estimation of scene depth provides good restoration with respect to visibility and contrast but without oversaturating. The algorithm is verified by a handful of foggy and hazy images.

84884279761	Single-crystalline heterostructure of ZnO nanowire arrays on large Ag microplates and its photocatalytic activity	This paper presents experimentally a photocatalytic heterogeneous structure of high-density ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays grown on large Ag microplates. First, the dense single-crystalline ZnO NW fabricated using an economical hydrothermal method possess a great reactive surface area because of their high surface-to-volume ratio. In addition, the large Ag microplates synthesized using a simple and competitive growth method serve as an electron reservoir. The heterojunction between ZnO NW and Ag microplates forms a Schottky contact to separate the electrons from the photogenerated excitons in ZnO NW, prolonging the lifetime of excitons and enhancing their photocatalytic capability. The photodegradation experiment employs the methylene blue aqueous solution to reveal a kinetic rate constant of up to 6.60 × 10

84891936620	Gold Nanorods Modified with Chitosan As Photothermal Agents	Gold nanorods (GNRs) are one of the nanomaterials, which could absorb near-infrared (NIR) light and convert to heat for the application on photothermal therapy. According to literature, Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is one of the widely used surfactant for the synthesis of GRNs. However, due to cell toxicity of CTAB, it is necessary to modify the surface of gold nanorods for cell-related studies. In this study, thiolated chitosan was employed to replace CTAB on gold nanorods due to its biocompatibility. The absorption spectra ranged from visible to NIR wavelength were tuned by changing the aspect ratio of chitosan-tagged GNRs. We further conjugated chitosan/GNRs with disiloganglioside (GD2) monoclonal antibody which can lead to the functionalized nanomaterials endocytosed into stNB-V1 neuroblastoma cells. After exposure with NIR laser at 808 nm, photothermal destruction of stNB-V1 cells was clearly demonstrated by calcein AM staining. © International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineering 2009.

84891829718	LC-tank divide-by-4 injection-locked frequency divider using the second-order harmonic feedback	A low voltage, wide locking range and operation range divide-by-4 injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) is proposed in the paper and the ILFD was fabricated in the TSMC 90 nm RF-CMOS process. The divide-by-4 ILFD uses a cross-coupled voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with a parallel-tuned LC resonator and a three-transistor composite that acts as a linear and nonlinear mixer. At a drain-source bias of 0.6 V and at an incident power of 0 dBm, the operation range of the divide-by-4 ILFD is 5.3 GHz, from the incident frequency 21.1 GHz to 26.4 GHz, and the percentage of operation range is 22.31%. The locking range of the divide-by-4 ILFD is 1.4 GHz, from the incident frequency 21.1 GHz to 22.5 GHz, and the percentage of locking range is 6.42%. The core power consumption is 2.58 mW. The die area is 0.86 × 0.75 mm

84892951659	Switched inductor dual-band CMOS cross-coupled VCO	This letter proposes a high-performance CMOS dual-band voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The VCO consists of two cross-coupled VCOs coupled by a pair of switched inductors or LC resonators to vary the resonator's inductance. A pair of nMOSFET is used to switch highand low-frequency bands. The VCO operates at the highband using low resonator's inductance and the VCO operates at the low-band using large inductance. The proposed VCO has been implemented with the TSMC 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS technology and it can generate differential signals in the frequency range of 5.6-6.66 GHz and 4.13-4.75 and it also has comparable high output voltage swings at both low and high-frequency bands. The die area of the dual-band VCO is 0.84 × 1.1 mm
