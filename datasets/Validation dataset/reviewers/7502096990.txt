2442556077	Spectroscopic investigation on the energy transfer process in photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria	In this work, we employ cyanobacteria, Spirulina platensis, and separate their photosynthetic apparatus, phycobilisome (PBS), thylakoid membrane and phycobilisome-thylakoid membrane complex. The steady state absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra and corresponding deconvoluted spectra and picosecond time-resolved spectra are used to investigate the energy transfer process in phycobilisome-thylakoid membrane complex. The results on steady state spectra show chlorophylls of the photosystem II are able to transfer excitation energy to phycobilisome with Chla molecules selectively excited. The decomposition of the steady state spectra further suggest the uphill energy transfer originate from chlorophylls of photosystem II to cores of phycobilisome, while rods and cores of phycobilisome cannot receive energy from the chlorophylls of photosystem I. The time constant for the back energy transfer process is 18ps. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33746919964	Shape-specific detection based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer using a flexible water-soluble conjugated polymer	We present the detection of the shape-specific conformation of DNA based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) by using a novel flexible water-soluble cationic conjugated polymer (CCP). The flexible backbone of CCP has more conformational freedom with the potential to be responsive to analyte shape by electrostatic interaction between flexible CCP and negatively charged DNA. The analyte shape dependent recognition is accomplished by structural changes that compressed or extended the flexible CCP. The morphology-dependent spectral properties of the novel flexible polymer related to the analyte shapes are investigated in detail, where two types of chromophores, referred to as "isolated" segment and "packed" segment aggregates, within the flexible polymer are identified by means of ensemble and single molecule measurements upon binding with different geometric DNA. The change in fluorescence intensity upon binding with shape-specific DNA without obvious color shifts makes this novel flexible polymer a suitable CCP donor for FRET measurements. The results provide insights for understanding the spectral properties of flexible water-soluble CCP and CCP/DNA interaction related to the geometry of target analyte. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33947609134	A reduced CSI feedback approach for precoded MIMO-OFDM systems	To obtain the closed-loop capacity of a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, channel state information (CSI) is required at the transmitter. To reduce the data rate of CSI feedback, precoding matrix approach has been proposed for MIMO systems in flat fading channels. In this paper, we develop a novel approach for MIMO-OFDM systems in frequency-selective fading channels. The proposed approach exploits the correlation of frequency responses at different subchannels in MIMO-OFDM systems to reduce CSI feedback. It is not only flexible to multiple data stream transmission but also has better performance than the existing approaches. © 2007 IEEE.

36348949562	Beamforming with imperfect CSI	With channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, beamforming can be used for spatial diversity and multiple spatial access. Due to latency and feedback bandwidth limitation, the CSI at the transmitter is often known with some ambiguity. In this paper, we develop a robust method for downlink beamforming that takes the ambiguity of the CSI into consideration. It is shown by computer simulation that, compared with the existing method, the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a 1% bit-error rate (BER) is reduced by over 2 dB for a system with 4 transmit antennas and 2 users when the variance of the CSI is -20 dB. The performance gain increases with the number of transmit antennas when the number of users is fixed. The required SNR for a 1% BER is reduced by over 4 dB if the the number of transmitter antennas is 8. We also study the impact of power allocation on the downlink beamforming. © 2007 IEEE.

36348970474	Power allocation without CSI feedback for decision-feedback MIMO signal detection	Transmit and receive antenna arrays can be used to form multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems for improving the reliability and capacity of data transmission. Layered space-time coding with decision-feedback detection is a promising technique for future wireless communications. In this paper, we investigate power allocation at the transmitter to improve the performance of the decision-feedback detection. The proposed power allocation method may only depend on or is even independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MIMO systems. When the SNR at the transmitter is not available, the power of each data stream is allocated according to the required bit-error-rate (BER) of the system. Computer simulation shows that the proposed method can improve the performance of a 2-input and 2-output system by 4 dB at 1% BER and that of a 4-input and 4-output system by 3.5 dB. © 2007 IEEE.

0033096963	Channel estimation for OFDM systems with transmitter diversity in mobile wireless channels	Transmitter diversity is an effective technique to improve wireless communication performance. In this paper, we investigate transmitter diversity using space-time coding for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in high-speed wireless data applications. We develop channel parameter estimation approaches, which are crucial for the decoding of the space-time codes, and we derive the MSE bounds of the estimators. The overall receiver performance using such a transmitter diversity scheme is demonstrated by extensive computer simulations. For an OFDM system with two transmitter antennas and two receiver antennas with transmission efficiency as high as 1.475 bits/s/Hz, the required signal-to-noise ratio is only about 7 dB for a 1% bit error rate and 9 dB for a 10% word error rate assuming channels with two-ray, typical urban, and hilly terrain delay profiles, and a 40-Hz Doppler frequency. In summary, with the proposed channel estimator, combining OFDM with transmitter diversity using space-time coding is a promising technique for highly efficient data transmission over mobile wireless channels.

77954303358	A consecutive-behaviors-observing-based neighbor evaluation model in P2P network	Reputation based trust mechanism has been identified as an effective method to evaluate peers' behavior and which is employed to secure the applications in P2P network. Trust mechanism is such a mechanism that relies on other peers' reports, which are also called local trust, to evaluate a designated peer. However, the existence of strategic peers and human judgment error is a big challenge, which makes the local trust hard to reflect peers' type. Furthermore, it increases the estimation error of global trust. The authors propose a new model, called PeerStrategy, to evaluate neighbor's behavior in P2P network. This model explores deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to describe the variance of neighbor's consecutive behaviors. The DFA consists of seven states and it transits between states by neighbor's performance in the interactions. By examining the probability of negative behaviors in any consecutive ones, the model can not only detect strategic peers accurately but also tolerate human judgment error. As a result, this model improves the accuracy of local trust, and what's more, it decreases the estimation error of global trust. The simulation shows that this model improves the accuracy of local trust considerately and also diminishes the influence on the estimation error of global trust, and it performs the best compared with other current methods.

80052870800	Fast double-parallel image processing based on FPGA	Due to FPGA's flexibility and parallelism, it is popular for accelerating image processing. In this paper, a double-parallel architecture based on FPGA has been exploited to speed up median filter and edge detection tasks, which are essential steps during image processing. The double-parallel scheme includes an image-level parallel and an operation-level parallel. The image-level parallel is a high-level parallel which divides one image into different parts and processes them concurrently. The operation-level parallel, which is embedded in each image-level parallel thread, fully explores every parallel part inside the concrete algorithms. The corresponding design is based on a DE2 Development Board which contains a CYCLONE II FPGA device. Meanwhile, the same task has also been implemented on PC and DSP for performance comparison. Despite the fact that operating frequencies of used PC and DSP are much higher than FPGA's, FPGA costs less time per computed image than both of them. By taking advantage of the double-parallel technique, the speed/frequency ratio of FPGA is 202 times faster than PC and 147 times faster than DSP. Finally, a detailed discussion about different platforms is conducted, which analyzes advantages and disadvantages of used computing platforms. This paper reveals that the proposed double-parallel scheme can dramatically speed up image processing methods even on a low-cost FPGA platform with low frequency and limited resources, which is very meaningful for practical applications. © 2011 IEEE.

84877303868	Physical activity recognition utilizing the built-in Kinematic sensors of a smartphone	Physical activity (PA) recognition has recently become important in activity monitoring for the public healthcare. Although body-worn sensors are well suited to collect data on activity patterns for long periods of time, users may forget to wear special microsensors. On the contrary, more and more people take smartphone with them almost anytime. At present, most popular smartphones have three built-in kinematic sensors (triaccelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetic sensor) which could be utilized to recognize PA. This study utilized three built-in kinematic sensors in a smartphone to recognize PA and found out which features derived from the three sensors were significant to different PA. We used a combined algorithm of Fisher's discriminant ratio criterion and J 3 criterion for feature selection. A hierarchical classifiers system including fourteen classifiers was proposed and employed to recognize fifteen activities. The optimal features derived from the built-in kinematic sensors of the smartphone were selected from 140 features. The results indicated that the accelerometer was significant to PA recognition, while gyroscope and orientation sensor were effective to recognize the change of body posture and detect falls, respectively. The total classification accuracy of 95.03% demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the built-in kinematic sensors of the smartphone to recognize PA. © 2013 Yi He and Ye Li.

57149141387	Practical considerations on channel estimation for up-link MC-CDMA systems	Channel parameters, which are usually estimated at the receiver, are required in signal detection in multi-carrier (MC) code division multiplex access (CDMA). The accuracy of channel estimation directly affects the performance of the overall system. In this paper, we present some practical techniques to improve channel estimation in up-link MC-CDMA systems. For most of multipath channels, there are only a few significant taps in time domain that determine the frequency response. Based on this characteristic, we detect and keep these significant taps and discard the trivial ones, which are usually very noisy or contain only noise components. After channel parameters are estimated at the pilot blocks, channels at the data blocks can be obtained by interpolation. To improve the performance of simple linear interpolation, we apply optimal interpolation, which takes channel estimation error and channel correlation into consideration. We then investigate the impact of channel estimation error on minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) successive interference cancelation (SIC) detector and find that more accurate channel is required to further improve the performance of the MMSE SIC detector. Therefore, we develop soft-decision-directed (SDD) channel estimation, which exploits the information at the data blocks to improve channel estimation. © 2008 IEEE.

In this paper, the transmit power control scheme for each data transmission between periodic spectrum sensing activities is proposed to improve the performance of the CR user with utilization of the statistics of the licensed band occupancy. While the conventional CR transmission scheme allocates the same transmit power to each data sample, our scheme varies the transmit power dynamically according to the non-interfering probability at each sample so that the effective transmission rate of the CR user increases and the expected interference level with the licensed communication decreases. Detection errors are also incorporated into the analysis. It is demonstrated by numerical results that our scheme considerably improves the overall bandwidth efficiency while ensuring the priority of licensed users. ©2008 IEEE.

62449270148	An approach to extracting central URLs on catalog page	Catalog pages construct the intermediate layer in architecture of a standard web site; therefore research on information retrieval for this kind of pages can be beneficial to improve web crawler's efficiency. A page is called "Catalog-style" if its main body is displayed as a sequence of regular entries, and the central link in each entry apparently contains the page's major information. Here, we propose a central-URL extraction approach, which can automatically recognize effective information from the main segmentation on catalog-page. Our approach combines machine learning classification and DOM (Document Object Model) tree based analysis. For one page, we represent each block node, mainly DIV and Table, by a set of content-based and structure-based features, which can be used as the input of support vector machine to determine whether it belongs to "Main-Body" or not. After identifying the main semantic block, a DOM tree based algorithm that utilizes catalog's heuristic rules is implemented to find the central URLs in the segmentation. The evaluation results show that our approach obtains encouraging results with a high recall/precision ratio. This can be applied in topicspecific search engine development and other Web applications. © 2008 IEEE.

64049104232	Energy-efficient video transmission over a wireless link	Energy minimization is an important design goal in wireless video transmission. We examine how the RF energy and the analog circuit energy, which account for a large part of the energy consumption for wireless video transmission, can be controlled with physical-layer parameters (e.g., modulation level, bit rate, bit error rate, and multiple access interference) and link-layer specifications (e.g., the buffer status, idle time, and active time). Building on these insights, we develop three energy-efficient video transmission schemes for the single-user system, i.e., frame-by-frame transmission, group of pictures (GOP)-by-GOP transmission, and client-buffer-related energy-efficient video transmission (CBEVT). Our simulations indicate that energy savings of up to 85% is achievable in the radio frequency (RF) front end using the CBEVT algorithm. We also present an energy-efficient optimal smoothing algorithm for reducing the RF front-end energy consumption and the peak data rate. For CDMA-based multiuser systems, we propose an RF front-end energy model that assumes perfect power control. We find the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) for the entire system that minimizes the total energy consumption. We propose the multiuser-based energy-efficient video transmission (MBEVT) algorithm, which can achieve energy savings of up to 38% for a six-user CDMA system with an independent 16-MB buffer for every uplink. © 2008 IEEE.

67249146477	On the accurate identification of familiar inter-domain routing instabilities	Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de facto inter-domain routing protocol nowadays, and its behavior greatly impacts the End-to-End Internet performance. Various work has been done on revealing the cause and location of BGP routing instability, and they are helpful for operators to recover their networks from routing disasters. However, current approaches have the "magic numbers" problem in choosing the parameters, which prevents the accuracy in finding the correct location from rising above a certain level. In this paper, we present a statistical approach based on pattern matching to accurately identify familiar BGP routing instabilities and pinpoint their locations. Simulation results show that our approach can achieve over 80% locating precision if the ongoing instability is not well isolated, and increases the average locating precision from 60% to 75% for a BGP session availability event.

0034441626	Detection of the photochemical intermediate processes in phycobiliproteins	The delayed luminescence was applied to detect the intermediate processes of the excited-state decay in the selectively excited phycobiliproteins. Phosphorescence spectra of the five types of phycobiliproteins, R-PE, CPC, APC, R-PC, PEC were reported in this article. The five phycobiliproteins showed different phosphorescence yields, the sequence of which was the same as that of the singlet oxygen yields. Based on the observation, it can be concluded that each of the chromophores possesses a characteristic phosphorescence emission. The delayed luminescence spectra of APC at different aggregation states (trimer, monomer and denatured APC) are researched. The lower aggregation APC showed less phosphorescence because of relative loose structures and less interaction with the surrounding proteins, while the denatured APC showed delayed fluorescence instead of phosphorescence because of triplet-triplet annihilation.

DCMU, betaine, and N-ethylmaleimide were applied to search for the details of energy transfer properties based on the steady fluorescence measurement and individual deconvolution spectra at state 2 or state 1. The closure of photosystem (PS) 2 did not influence on fluorescence yields of PS1, i.e., energy could not spill to PS1 from PS2. When the energy transfer pathway from PBS to PS1 was disturbed, the relative fluorescence yield of PS2 was almost the same as that of PS2 in complexes without treatment. If PBSs were fixed by betaine, the state transition process was restrained. Hence PBS may detach from PS2 and become associated to PS1 at state 2. Our results contradict the proposed "spill-over" or "PBS detachment" models and support the mobile "PBS model".

79951808313	Energy-quality system design for wireless communication	In the state-of-the-art wireless communication system, the energy consumed by RF front-end is always more than that of digital sections. As a result, we must minimize it to design energy-quality wireless systems. In this paper, we update our former work on RF front-end energy model and minimize the energy consumption in RF circuit by adjusting the base-band parameters, such as modulation level, data rate and signal peak-to-average ratio (PAR) etc. We compared the power consumption of different modulation schemes of MQAM and MPSK first, and compare the energy efficiency in wireless system. In the mean while, we consider the impacts of circuit thermal noise, 1/f noise, the harmonic distortion and the channel flat fading, on the communication quality. At last, we propose the steps of the system design by choose the most energy efficient system parameters under certain bit error rate (BER) requirement. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

0035795147	Temperature-induced decoupling of phycobilisomes from reaction centers	Temperature-induced decoupling of phycobilisomes (PBSs) from the reaction centers in the PBS-thylakoid membrane complexes was observed at 0°C. The fluorescence yields of photosystem (PS) I and PSII decreased and that of PBSs increased with selective excitation of PBSs at 0°C, while the yield of PBSs decreased and those of the two photosystems increased with selective excitation of chlorophyll a at room temperature (RT). It indicated that the decoupling of PBSs from the two photosystems led to changes of energy transfer efficiencies, which can be explained by partial detachment of PBSs from thylakoid membrane. The temperature-dependent processes were reversible, i.e. with temperature going up to RT, the complexes could restore to the functionally coupled state with a time constant about 30 s. Based on these results, it could be deduced that PBSs should be in parallel connection with the two photosystems. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Firstly, vehicle detection is the first step of video processing and detection methods are classified into background modeling based methods and non-background modeling based methods. In particular, nighttime detection is more challenging due to bad illumination and sensitivity to light. Then tracking techniques, including 3D model-based, region-based, active contour-based and feature-based tracking, are presented. A variety of algorithms including MeanShift algorithm, Kalman Filter and Particle Filter are applied in tracking process. In addition, shadow detection and vehicles occlusion bring much trouble into vehicle detection, tracking and so on.

A family of biometrics based security methods has been proposed in the last several years, where the bio-information derived from physiological signals is used as entity identifiers (EIs) for multiple security purposes, including node recognition and keying material protection. Among them, a method named as Physiological Signal based Key Agreement (PSKA) was proposed to use frequency-domain information of physiological signals together with Fuzzy Vault scheme to secure key distribution in BSN. In this study, the PSKA scheme was firstly analyzed and evaluated for its practical usage in terms of fuzzy performance, the result of which indicates that the scheme is not as good as claimed. An improved scheme with the deployment of Fuzzy Vault and error correcting coding was then proposed, followed by simulation analysis. The results indicate that the improved scheme is able to improve the performance of Fuzzy Vault and thus the success rate of authentication or key distribution between genuine nodes of a BSN. © 2011 IEEE.

84055193401	The PLR-DTW method for ECG based biometric identification	There has been a surge of research on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal based biometric for person identification. Though most of the existing studies claimed that ECG signal is unique to an individual and can be a viable biometric, one of the main difficulties for real-world applications of ECG biometric is the accuracy performance. To address this problem, this study proposes a PLR-DTW method for ECG biometric, where the Piecewise Linear Representation (PLR) is used to keep important information of an ECG signal segment while reduce the data dimension at the same time if necessary, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is used for similarity measures between two signal segments. The performance evaluation was carried out on three ECG databases, and the existing method using wavelet coefficients, which was proved to have good accuracy performance, was selected for comparison. The analysis results show that the PLR-DTW method achieves an accuracy rate of 100% for identification, while the one using wavelet coefficients achieved only around 93%. © 2011 IEEE.

84055193789	An improved scheme of IPI-based entity identifier generation for securing body sensor networks	Securing body sensor network (BSN) in an efficient manner is very important for preserving the privacy of medical data. Protecting data confidentiality, integrity and to authenticate the communicating nodes are basic requirements to secure BSN. The existing method to generate entity identifier (EI) from inter-pulse intervals (IPIs) of heartbeats has its advantages in authenticating and identifying nodes, which however was found in this study that such generated EIs are not so resistant to attacks because of potential error patterns. This paper presents an improved scheme of IPI-based EI generation to eliminate the error patterns. The performance of randomness and node identification, i.e. false acceptance rate and false rejection rate, is experimentally evaluated. The results indicate that compared with the existing one, the new scheme is effective to eliminate the error patterns and thus more tolerant to attacks, while there is no compromise on the randomness level and identification performance. © 2011 IEEE.

84862797442	Benefits brought by cognitive radio for the next generation cellular networks: A perspective from industry	With the explosion of network traffic in the future IMT-advanced system, the revenue for mobile operators is not increasing anywhere near as fast as the network traffic. This means that operators must innovate, bring costs down, and leverage their networks as much as possible, given already significant investments made. Cognitive radio will solve such economic challenges on deployment and maintenance cost with two aspects. One is related to flexible spectrum usage with the used frequency range, coverage and the backbone network, such as TV white space usage. The other is that cognitive radio improves the next generation cellular network from channel adaptive to be environment aware, as in Self-Optimized Networks (SON). Cognitive radio will make the mobile communication paradigm become more and more personal with higher spectrum utilization efficiency in multiple dimensions than in the past. In this paper, we mainly focus on the benefit brought by cognitive radio for the next generation cellular networks, such as Long Term Evolution advanced or 802.16m, and how to achieve this on application solutions and techniques. We present our initial results on these key techniques.

84863106523	Rear lamp based vehicle detection and tracking for complex traffic conditions	In video surveillance system, detection and tracking of vehicles are two foundational and significant tasks. In this paper, a vehicle detection and tracking method based on rear lamp pairs is proposed. The proposed method combines color with motion information to perform vehicle detection. In order to adapt to different weather conditions like night, the rear lamps are divided into two categories: unlit lamps and lighted lamps. First, threshold segmentation are used to extract both the unlit and lighted lamp candidates in hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space and the thresholds are selected automatically by maximally stable extremal region (MSER) method. Then, all lamp candidates are tracked by using Kalman filter and lamp candidates with short-lived trajectories are removed to avoid disturbances. Next, two adjacent lamp candidates with similar speed are bound together as a region of interest (ROI), which represents a potential pair of lamps. Image cross-correlation symmetry analysis based on Gabor filter is utilized to find the ROIs with symmetrical texture and these symmetric ROIs can be regarded as pairs of lamps. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively deal with various illumination conditions and improve the accuracy and robustness of vehicle detection. In addition, this method can perform vehicle detection and tracking under complex traffic conditions and the Gabor filter based symmetry analysis can successfully suppress subtle difference between the left and right parts of a vehicle as well as environment noises. © 2012 IEEE.

Cloud computing owns the pervasive and on-demand service-oriented natures, which can fit the characteristics of healthcare services very well.

84872132827	Energy-model-based optimal communication systems design for wireless sensor networks	As is widely used in our daily life, wireless sensor network (WSN) is considered as one of the most important technologies of the new century. Although, the sensor nodes are usually battery powered with limited energy sources, the system energy consumption must be minimized in order to extend the life time. Since the energy consumption of transceiver front ends is dominant in the whole sensor nodes, we focus on how to minimize energy consumption by the system level design. According to the applications, we analyze four types of RF architectures: on-off keying (OOK) transceiver, phase-shift keying (PSK) transceiver, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) transceiver, and frequency-shift keying (FSK) transceiver which are widely used in WSN and establish the related energy models for each kind of architecture, respectively. We connect the baseband parameters such as modulation level, data rate, bandwidth, and propagation distance. with the energy consumption of RF front end for WSN. Afterwards, through theoretical and numerical analysis in system level, we discuss and conclude how to design optimal energy-quality system in terms of various application scenarios. © 2012 Ye Li et al.

84878687583	Vehicle detection based on the and- or graph for congested traffic conditions	In urban traffic video monitoring systems, traffic congestion is a common scene that causes vehicle occlusion and is a challenge for current vehicle detection methods. To solve the occlusion problem in congested traffic conditions, we have proposed an effective vehicle detection approach based on an and -or graph (AOG) in this paper. Our method includes three steps: constructing an AOG for representing vehicle objects in the congested traffic condition; training parameters in the AOG; and, finally, detecting vehicles using bottom-up inference. In AOG construction, sophisticated vehicle feature selection avoids using the easily occluded vehicle components but takes highly visible components into account. The vehicles are well represented by these selected vehicle features in the presence of a congested condition with serious vehicle occlusion. Furthermore, a hierarchical decomposition of the vehicle representation is proposed during AOG construction to further reduce the impact of vehicle occlusion. After AOG construction, all parameters in the AOG are manually learned from the training images or set and further applied to the bottom-up vehicle inference. There are two innovations of our method, i.e., the usage of the AOG in vehicle detection under congested traffic conditions and the special vehicle feature selection for vehicle representation. To fully test our method, we have done a quantitative experiment under a variety of traffic conditions, a contrast experiment, and several experiments on congested conditions. The experimental results illustrate that our method can effectively deal with various vehicle poses, vehicle shapes, and time-of-day and weather conditions. In particular, our approach performs well in congested traffic conditions with serious vehicle occlusion. © 2011 IEEE.

84879358171	Biometric key distribution solution with energy distribution information of physiological signals for body sensor network security	Recently, a kind of lightweight and resource-efficient biometrics-based security solutions were proposed for the emerging body sensor network (BSN). In such security solutions, physiological characteristics that can be captured by individual sensors of BSN were proposed to generate entity identifiers (EIs) for securing keying materials by a biometric approach. In this study, the authors focus on an improved key distribution solution with the energy distribution information of physiological signals (EDPSs) -based EIs. Firstly, different EDPS-based EI generation schemes are studied. Based on the existing multi-windows Fourier transform scheme, a modified one with single-window is proposed to improve the identification performance of the generated EIs. Then, a different method based on the discrete cosine transform of the autocorrelation sequence of physiological signals is proposed aiming for a significant increase in identification rates. The performances of time-varying randomness and identification rates are evaluated to examine EI's feasibility in securing the transmission of keying materials. Based on the characteristics of generated EIs, the corresponding key distribution solution, that is, user-dependent fuzzy vault, is proposed. A detailed system performance analysis in terms of half total error rate, antiattack ability, as well as computational complexity, is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.

The main concern of this paper is how to extend the battery's lifetime. According to the characteristics and functionality of sensor nodes, the sensor applications are categorized into three distinct types, i.e., the hard real-time applications, the soft real-time applications, and the periodic applications. For the hard real-time applications, a battery-friendly lazy packet scheme is designed to draw smoother and lower current for minimizing battery charge consumption. A battery-friendly local optimization scheme with slack time is exploited and evaluated for the soft real-time applications. For the periodic applications, a battery-aware task-scheduling algorithm is developed, which reschedules tasks of sensor nodes to achieve the battery friendly discharge profile.

Up to now, high-resolution crystal structure data have been available only for the isolated phycobiliproteins. To have an understanding of the functional connection between different phycobiliproteins, it is necessary to study the complexes composed of different phycobiliproteins. The energy transfer processes in C-phycocyanin complexes were studied through computer simulation because it is difficult to be studied by conventional experimental methods. The main pathways of energy flow and the dynamic property of the energy transfer were obtained. A fast transfer process between two neighboring disks was observed through analyzing the distribution curves of excitation energy over time. According to the definition of the time constants for energy transfer in time-resolved spectrum techniques, for a complex with three C-phycocyanin hexamer disks, a fluorescence-rising component with several picoseconds was obtained in disk 2 and 20 ps in disk 3 when the chromophores in disk 1 were excited by an ideal δ pulsed laser beam. The results showed clearly that the energy transfer between the disks in an antenna rod was very fast and that energy transfer was fast and efficient in an intact antenna system of algae.

84890440158	Component-based license plate detection using conditional random field model	This paper presents a novel algorithm for license plate detection in complex scenes, particularly for the all-day traffic surveillance environment. Unlike low-level feature-based methods, our work is motivated by component-based models for object detection. The detection process is divided into three steps, namely, decomposition, modeling, and inference. First, observing that one license plate is decomposed into several constituent characters, the maximally stable extremal region detector is used to extract candidate characters in images. Then, conditional random field (CRF) models are constructed on the candidate characters in neighborhoods. This way, the spatial and visual relationships among the characters is integrated in CRF in the form of probability distribution. Finally, the exact bounding boxes of license plates are estimated through the belief propagation inference on CRF. Both visual and structural features of license plates are fully exploited during detection. Hence, our approach can adapt to various environmental factors, such as cluttered background and illumination variation. A series of experiments are conducted on images that are collected from the actual road surveillance environment. The experimental results show the outstanding detection performance of the proposed method comparing with traditional algorithms. © 2000-2011 IEEE.
