15044342297	Motion filter for video stabilizing systems	Video shot with a hand held digital camera may have jitter caused by the holder's motions. This paper presents an algorithm to stabilize the jitter in videos which includes three modules: global motion estimates, motion filters, and motion compensation. The most common motions, translation, and rotation are currently corrected by the algorithm. Block matching is used to calculate the initial motion parameters which are then refined using the Newton iteration method. A two-order B-spline-based filter is then used to alleviate jitter in the video. Unlike previous techniques, a smooth video can be constructed without a prior jitter model. Test results show that the method removes video jitter and significantly improves the visual effect.

24944533403	An end-to-end robust approach for scalable video over the Internet	This paper introduces an end-to-end robust approach for scalable video over the Internet. The traditional method only considers congestion control, error control and is unable to achieve end-to-end high-quality video transmission in the error-prone environment like the Internet since it does not consider the packetization behavior, network conditions and the media characteristics simultaneously. This paper presents an end-to-end approach for scalable video over the Internet, combining network adaptive congestion control and unequal error control. Considering requirements of multimedia transmission, this paper introduces multimedia congestion control to estimate available bandwidth and smooth the media sending rate. Specially in the transport layer we propose unequal interleaving packetization method and unequal error protection scheme, which can alleviate the effect of the packet loss well. Further we develop the rate-distortion theory for the scalable video over the Internet. Thereafter the optimal bit allocation is presented to determine the bits budgets for the source part and error control part. Simulation shows our scheme can achieve good performance for scalable video over the Internet. Copyright by Science in China Press 2004.

35348860723	Enhanced sports video shot boundary detection based on middle level features and a unified model	The performance of shot boundary detection algorithms using low level features can hardly fulfill the requirement of automatic sports video analysis, which is a promising module in Personal Video Recorders. Two kinds of middle level features are proposed in this paper to effectively enhance the shot boundary detection. One kind of the features is extracted from the projection of the Dominant Color mask; the other kind is extracted from the reliable block-based Motion Vectors. These novel features, together with the Region Color Histograms feature, are integrated into a unified model which employs Support Vector Machines to detect both cuts and gradual transitions. Experiments on diversified soccer video sequences demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the existing algorithms and is quite competent for the targeted applications. © 2007 IEEE.

60549093707	Recovery of upper body poses in static images based on joints detection	Recovering human body poses from static images is challenging without prior knowledge of pose, appearance, background and clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based upper poses recovery method via effective joints detection. In our research, three observables are firstly detected: face, skin, and torso. Then the joints are properly initialized according to the observables and some heuristic configuration constraints. Finally the sample-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to determine the final pose. The main contributions of this paper include a robust torso detector through maximizing a posterior estimation, effective joints initialization, and two continuous likelihood functions developed for effective pose inference. Experiments on 250 real world images show that our method can accurately recover upper body poses from images with a variety of individuals, poses, backgrounds and clothing. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

After capturing the speckle pattern with an infrared digital camera, we extract the pure speckle pattern using a direct-global separation method. Then the pure speckles are represented by Census binary features. By evaluating the matching cost and uniqueness between the real-time image and the reference image, robust correspondences are selected as support points. After that, we build a disparity grid and propose a generative graphical model to compute disparities. An iterative approach is designed to propagate the messages between blocks and update the model.

The algorithm enables PSNR estimates based on the Laplacian probability density function of the quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients extracted from a video bit stream. The algorithm is optimized for the video coding standard H.264 based on its frame structure and its combination of transform and quantization, which accommodates different bit rates and frame types. Tests on various rates and motion videos give average difference of 1dB between the estimated PSNR and the real PSNR for moderate bit rates.

51449097475	Kernel based articulated object tracking with scale adaptation and model update	Kernel based object tracking (KBOT) is one of the most popular and effective techniques for tracking task. However the constancy of the target model and unsound scale adaptation method are two main limitations. In this paper, we present a kernel based approach incorporated with scale estimation and target model update for articulated object tracking task. After predicating the object center with scale fixed KBOT, we extend scale selection theory to estimate the local optimal object scale. Once the object scale has been estimated, a kernel density estimation based strategy is developed to update the target model. Experimental results show that our approach is superior to traditional KBOT in the following two aspects: 1) it is less affected by the object scale change; 2) it is less prone to appearance variation. ©2008 IEEE.

53649102554	Change detection algorithm for man-made objects based on multi-temporal remote sensing images	The detection accuracy of traditional pixel-level change detection algorithms is seriously influenced by radiometric difference, registration error and the determination of classification threshold for a different image, and it is difficult to differentiate the true changes of interest from various kinds of detected changes. Therefore, a novel two-step change detection algorithm combining feature-level and pixel-level techniques is proposed to detect changes of man-made objects in multi-temporal remote sensing images. Large-size images are divided into overlapping sub-images, and the changed regions containing man-made objects are extracted by supervised sub-image classification. Then, a pixel-level change detection algorithm is developed to obtain quantitative detection results. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

55649086001	Object detection using edge fragment-based features	A detection algorithm was developed to detect objects with large variances in color, texture, and shape. The algorithm does not need any manual selection or segmentation to automatically extract edge fragments from training samples to form a dictionary of templates. A modified statistical region merge segmentation algorithm and the Adaboost learning strategy are used to dramatically reduce the effect of noise caused by the automatic extraction of the edge fragments. The matching cost used in each weak classifier is based on the shape and distance similarities between the training samples and the edge fragments. Then the Cascaded Adaboost is used to select discriminative edge fragments to form a series of star models going from simpler models to more complex models to detect objects. The experimental results show that the method is very robust to large variances in color, texture, and shape. The system has a 90% detection rate on a database of up-right ear dogs.

57249106560	Anomaly detection based on motion direction	A novel algorithm is proposed in this paper to detect anomalous human behaviors based on motion directions. According to diffrent motion direction rules for diffrent events, we introduce block-based motion directions to model those events, and use support vector machine (SVM) to detect the abnormalous actions from real-time monitoring video sequences. To increase the robustness against noise and to capture the slight movement of the object, we select the foreground frames (the frames having human object) with a background edge model before the action feature extraction. Then, action features are extracted using normalized histogram analysis from the motion directions of all the foreground frames. Our experiments on public areas such as hallway show that our algorithm is able to track complex actions of single and multiple people accurately and is robust against the variation of object size, lighting, and noise during their movements. Our algorithm is of low computation complexity thus it can be used for real time monitoring.

A novel cascaded and additive model based on cascaded Adaboost classifier is proposed in this paper. This combined model consists of two cascaded Adaboost classifiers which are independently trained with edge-fragment feature and Haar feature to describe the whole object and one of its stable components, respectively. The final classification decision of the combined model is made according to the stage indexes by which a sample is rejected or accepted in the two cascaded classifiers. Experiments on several test databases show that the combined model can take advantages of the speed merit of Haar feature and the robustness of edge-fragment feature. Compared with single feature-based model, the detection performance of the combined model is greatly improved. © 2009 Acta Automatica Sinica. All rights reserved.

66549092531	Feature selection based on weight updating and K-L distance	Edge-fragment feature is very stable in detecting objects with large variances in color, texture, and shape. Traditional methods that extract edge-fragments from a few manually segmented samples cannot meet the requirement of statistical learning in case of large number of training samples. However, if the training samples are automatically segmented, it is inevitable that huge amount of edge-fragments from background of the training samples will appear in the feature set. In that case, the feature-selection algorithm is very critical to the detection task. In this paper, a feature-selection algorithm based on weight updating scheme of Adaboost and K-L distance is proposed. In each round of Adaboost learning, a subset of all the edge-fragments is selected as the feature set for training Adaboost weak classifier. Because the proposed feature-selection algorithm takes into account the edge-fragments' discrimination information between positive samples and negative samples, it can effectively reduce the number of edge-fragments from background in the final classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.

This paper presents a graph cuts algorithm to segment arbitrary skin regions from images. The detected face is used to determine the foreground skin seeds and the background non-skin seeds with the color probability distributions for the foreground represented by a single Gaussian model and for the background by a Gaussian mixture model. The probability distribution of the image is used for noise suppression to alleviate the influence of the background regions having skin-like colors. Finally, the skin is segmented by graph cuts, with the regional parameter γ optimally selected to adapt to different images. Tests of the algorithm on many real world photographs show that the scheme accurately segments skin regions and is robust against illumination variations, individual skin variations, and cluttered backgrounds. © 2009 Tsinghua University Press.

74449093898	An incremental Bhattacharyya dissimilarity measure for particle filtering	The dissimilarity between a target descriptor and a particle descriptor is a crucial parameter in the particle filtering (PF), while the widely used Bhattacharyya dissimilarity (BD) is not discriminative enough. This paper presents an incremental Bhattacharyya dissimilarity (IBD) for measuring histogram based descriptors (HBDs) used for particle weight estimation. IBD is defined by incorporating an incremental similarity matrix (ISM) into the BD. Such an ISM imposes the incremental similarity beliefs on the matched bin patches of two input histograms and enables a cross-bin interaction during the comparison, which yields the enhanced capability of discriminating the particles located in the object from those positioned in the background. We propose a robust approach to compute the ISM by jointly utilizing the spatial and temporal attributes. Also, to handle target appearance changes and deformations, a classification-inspired target model update strategy is presented. These components lead to an effective and robust tracking algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that IBD shows promising discriminative capability in comparison with other state of the art dissimilarity measures. Moreover, the IBD based PF-tracker also exhibits competitive tracking performance, especially under scenarios of partial occlusion and background clutter. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Different strategies are used in the hierarchical frame-down-sampling. At the first sampling stage, dynamic piecewise linear model is constructed based on the inter-frame interval and overlap ratio. Estimating-checking-modifying loop is adopted in this model to adapt the frame-sampling interval and select the candidate key frames. The second stage checks the frame-to-frame overlap ratio among the candidate key frames and decides the final key frames. Finally the panorama is constructed from the sampling key frames. Compared with the traditional video mosaicking which utilized all the frames, this scheme is much more efficient without losing essential visual information. Experiments on real video sequences show that this algorithm can extract robust key frames and achieve high-quality video panoramas with low computational costs.

78549233027	On the effectiveness of opportunistic routing over wireless mesh networks	Recently, opportunistic routing has gained much popularity for the ability to exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless medium with several practical protocols been proposed over wireless mesh networks (WMNs). These protocols usually add many mechanisms to introduce a dramatic increase in the overall network throughput, such as reliability promise and rate control. However, the evaluation of these protocols did not show how much performance benefit can be expected from each mechanism. In this paper, we provide a systematic performance evaluation on the effectiveness of reliability promise and rate control mechanisms that commonly used in opportunistic routing protocols. Our study shows that: (i) batch acknowledgment used in opportunistic routing significant improves the transmission performance over traditional routing, the true gain from opportunistic routing is not as much as claimed in previous works. (ii) rate control is important to the opportunistic routing. It ensures opportunistic routing to utilize its advantage sufficiently, but also prevents the performance degradation when the network is congested. These results give us new understanding in the effectiveness of the opportunistic routing. We then analyze and uncover reasons for these results and propose some specific schemes. © 2010 IEEE.

The popular SIFT descriptor computes the texture information on a grey-scale patch. Instead our descriptor use only the topology and geometric information among MSERs so that features can be rapidly matched regardless of the texture in the image patch. Based on the ellipses fitting for the detected MSERs, geometric affine invariants between ellipses pair are extracted as the descriptors. Finally topology based voting selector is designed to achieve the best correspondences. Experiment shows that our descriptor is not only computational faster than SIFT descriptor , but also has better performance on wide angle of view and nonlinear illumination change.

To this end, several novel components are proposed. A hybrid approach is first proposed to automatically infer the beginning position of hand gestures of interest via jointly optimizing the regions given by an offline skin model trained from Gaussian mixture models and a specific hand gesture classifier trained from the Adaboost technique. To consistently track the hand in the context of using kernel based tracking, a semi-supervised feature selection strategy is further presented to choose the feature subspaces which appropriately represent the properties of offline hand skin cues and online foreground-background-classification cues. Taking the histogram of oriented gradients as the descriptor to represent hand gestures, a soft-decision approach is finally proposed for recognizing static hand gestures at the locations where severe ambiguity occurs and hidden Markov model based dynamic gestures are employed for interaction. Experiments on various real video sequences show the superior performance of the proposed components.

80051659110	Multiple instance tracking based on hierarchical maximizing bag's margin boosting	In online tracking, the tracker evolves to reflect variations in object appearance and surroundings. This updating process is formulated as a supervised learning problem, thus a slight inaccuracy of the tracker will degrade the updating. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is used to alleviate such a problem by representing training samples in bags of image patches (or called instances). Difficulties are then passed on to the learning method to train a classifier that discovers the most accurate instance. This paper proposes a Maximizing Bag's Margin (MBM) criteria for MIL. Combined with MBM, a hierarchical boosting is proposed for updating, in which bag and instance weights are introduced to guide classifier retraining.

Compared with other propagation algorithms using matching cost as messages, IUFDCM updates the disparity map and the confidence map in an interleaving manner instead. Based on the Confidence-based Support Window (CSW), disparity map is updated adaptively to alleviate the effect of input parameters. The reassignment for unreliable pixels with larger probability keeps ground truth depending on reliable messages. Consequently, the confidence map is updated according to the previous disparity map and the left-right consistency. The top ranks on Middlebury benchmark corresponding to different error thresholds demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive with the best stereo matching algorithms at present.

84862809538	A compact association of particle filtering and kernel based object tracking	Particle filtering (PF) and kernel based object tracking (KBOT) algorithms have shown their promises in a wide range of visual tracking contexts. This paper mainly addresses the association of PF and KBOT. Unlike other related association approaches which usually directly use KBOT to refine the position states of propagated particles for more accurate mode seeking, we elucidate the problem of what kind of particles is suitable for employing KBOT to refine their position states from a theoretical point of view. In accordance with the theoretical analysis, a two-stage solution is also proposed to resample propagated particles that are suitable for invoking KBOT from a computational perspective. The incremental Bhattacharyya dissimilarity (IBD) based stage is designed to consistently distinguish the particles located in the object region from the others placed in the background, while the matrix condition number based stage is formulated to further eliminate the particles positioned at the ill-posed conditions for running KBOT. Once the appropriate particles are obtained, constrained gradient based mean shift optimization enables us to efficiently refine the particles position states. Besides, a state transition model embodying object-scale oriented information and prior motion cues is presented to adapt to fast movement scenarios. These ingredients lead to a new tracking algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed association approach is more robust to handle complex tracking conditions in comparison with related methods.

This paper proposes an improved kernel based object tracking method based on discriminative subspace selection and multi-kernel calibration mechanism. First, a bag of candidate subspaces are generated by linear image space mapping, the discriminative subspaces are online selected by evaluating hand and background information model via a discriminative function, then an off-line trained mixture of Gaussian skin model is employed to concentrate subspaces of high confidence to formulate the object representation. Second, to adapt to fast motion and scale variation, the kernel location is calibrated via multi-kernel similarity surface estimation; and facilitated iterative target locating.

84862243618	Quick matting for videos based on depth images of the Kinect	Video matting can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a quick matting algorithm for videos based on depth images of the Kinect. First, the color image information is used to improve the region-growth process to estimate the trimap (marked as the foreground, the background and unknown regions). This scheme avoids the effect of occlusion regions. Secondly, samples refinement of the foreground and background regions is used to preserve the accuracy of the matting results while reducing the computational cost. Finally, the depth, color and confidence image are combined into a weighting filter to smooth the matting results and reduce the number of low confidence pixels.

84862243931	Color self-similarity feature based real-time pedestrian detection	Pedestrian detection has wide applications in intelligent surveillance and driver assistant systems. The most commonly used feature in pedestrian detection algorithms is a histogram of the oriented gradient (HOG), which is computationally intensive and results in slow detection speed. This analysis uses a color self-similarity feature (CSSF) that calculates the ratio of two rectangles to measure the self-similarity on the color channels. First, when extracting the human structure information, CSSF avoids the time-consuming gradient calculation which increases the speed. Secondly, CSSF uses a scalar feature which can be efficiently integrated with the AdaBoost based cascaded classifiers learning framework for training the human detector. Thirdly, CSSF is scale invariant, resulting in fast multi-scale detection. Tests show that the CSSF based detector gives improved accuracy and 7 times speedup compared with HOG detectors and can achieve real-time processing with 640×480 images.

We explore the flexible handling of color disparity, spatial relation and the reliability of matching pixels in support windows. Building upon these key ingredients, a robust stereo matching algorithm using local plane fitting by Confidence-based Support Window (CSW) is presented. For each CSW, only these pixels with high confidence are employed to estimate optimal disparity plane. Considering that RANSAC has shown to be robust in suppressing the disturbance resulting from outliers, we employ it to solve local plane fitting problem.

84863155471	Three-level GPU accelerated Gaussian mixture model for background subtraction	Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for background subtraction (BGS) is widely used for detecting and tracking objects in video sequences. Although the GMM can provide good results, low processing speed has become its bottleneck for realtime applications. We propose a novel method to accelerate the GMM algorithm based on graphics processing unit (GPU). As GPU excels at performing massively parallel operations, the novelty lies in how to adopt various optimization strategies to fully exploit GPU's resources. The parallel design consists of three levels. On the basis of first-level implementation, we employ techniques such as memory access coalescing and memory address saving to the secondlevel optimization and the third-level modification, which reduces the time cost and increases the bandwidth greatly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can yield performance gains of 145 frames per second (fps) for VGA (640*480) video and 505 fps for QVGA (320*240) video which outperform their CPU counterparts by 24X and 23X speedup respectively.

In this paper, we propose an efficient framework aiming to stitch aerial videos in real time. Reasonable distortions are allowed as a tradeoff for acceleration. Instead of searching for globally optimized solutions, we directly refine frame positions with sensor data to compensate for the accumulative error in alignment. A priority scan method is proposed to select pixels within overlapping area into the final panorama for blending, which avoids complicated operations like weighting or averaging on pixels.

Additionally, all confident pairs are preserved to extract potential symmetries since one feature point may be shared by different pairs. Further, each feature pair forms one cluster and is merged and split iteratively based on the continuity in the Cartesian and concentration in the polar coordinates. Pseudo symmetric axes and outlier midpoints are eliminated during the process. Experiments demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm visually and quantitatively.

However, aerial videos captured on unmanned aerial vehicles cannot be stitched by it due to the flexibility in their flight routes. This paper proposes an improved method to handle the varying direction problems via multi-direction strips. First, various slope strips for different scan directions are defined.

First a self-adapting binarization is introduced to reduce the influence of inconsistent intensity. Then we apply local window-based correlation matching to get the initial disparity map. After the initialization, we formulate a progressive updating scheme to update the disparity estimation. There are two main steps in each round of updation. At first new reliable points are progressively selected based on three aspects of criterion including matching degree, confidence, and left-right consistency; then prediction-based growing matching is adopted to recalculate the disparity map from the reliable points. Finally, the more accurate depth map can be obtained by subpixel interpolation and transformation.

84875865029	Local matting based on sample-pair propagation and iterative refinement	This paper proposes a novel local matting algorithm based on sample-pair propagation and iterative refinement. Since sample-pairs of the foreground and background in the neighborhood are limited, they fail to fit the linear model well. We propose a sample-pair propagation scheme which propagates the confident sample-pair of each pixel to its neighbors so that they can collect more confident sample-pairs to estimate alpha values accurately. To avoid high time and space complexity of the global optimization, we convert matting into a de-noising problem and refine alpha values via fitting the linear model and smoothing the alpha matte locally and iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm produces more accurate results than the state-of-the-art of local matting. © 2012 IEEE.

First, in order to gather foreground/background samples effectively, we shoot rays in hybrid (gradient and uniform) directions. This strategy utilizes the prior knowledge to adjust the directions for effective searching. Second, we refine sample-pairs of pixels by taking into account neighbors'. Both high confidence sample-pairs and usable foreground/background components are utilized and thus more accurate and smoother matting results are achieved. Third, to reduce the computational cost of sample-pair selection in coarse matting, this paper proposes an adaptive sample clustering approach. Most redundant samples are eliminated adaptively, where the computational cost decreases significantly. Finally, we convert fine matting into a de-noising problem, which is optimized by minimizing the observation and state errors iteratively and locally. This leads to less space and time complexity compared with global optimization. Experiments demonstrate that we outperform other state-of-the-art methods in local matting both on accuracy and efficiency.

For this purpose, a mixture Gaussian kernel function based similarity is presented to evaluate the discrepancy between the target region and the particle region. Such a similarity can be interpreted as the expectation of the spatial weighted feature distribution over the target region.

We design a novel feature named pair normalized channel feature (PNCF), which simultaneously combines and normalizes two channel features in image channels, achieving a highly discriminative power and computational efficiency. PNCF applies to both gradient channels and color channels so that shape and appearance information are described and integrated in the same feature. To efficiently explore the formidably large PNCF feature space, we propose a statistics-based feature learning method to select a small number of potentially discriminative candidate features, which are fed into the boosting algorithm. In addition, channel compression and a hybrid pyramid are employed to speed up the multiscale detection. Experiments illustrate the effectiveness of PNCF and its learning method.

Then, the ratio of foreground blobs to the whole image is calculated with a mechanism for threshold segmentation. Finally, a regression algorithm based on the local features is used to analyze images below the threshold with a classification algorithm based on global features images used to analyze images above the threshold. A texture descriptor combining wavelet transforms and a gray level co-occurrence matrix is then used to improve the classification accuracy for the classification algorithm based on the global features. Tests demonstrate that this method is both accurate and robust for different crowd density levels.

0042062336	Feature based adaptive error concealment for image transmission over wireless channel	Error concealment is becoming increasingly important because of the growing interest in multimedia transmission over unreliable channels such as wireless channel. At present most concealment method has its own advantage as well as applicable limitation. In different case, it can achieve different concealment effect. In our paper, we present a novel feature-based image error detection and error concealment algorithm to improve the image quality which was degraded during its transmission over wireless channel. First a simulation channel based on Rayleigh mode is implemented to emulating the actual wireless fading channel characterized by fading, multipath and Doppler frequency shift. The damaged image blocks are detected by exploring the contextual information in images, such as their consistency and edge continuity. The statistical characteristics of missing blocks are then estimated based on the types of their surrounding blocks (e.g., smoothness, texture and edge). Finally different error concealment strategies are applied to different types of blocks in order to achieve better visual quality. Instead of assuming random errors in packets, we simulate the errors of wireless channel based on the Rayleigh model. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of still images. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is effective in terms of visual quality assessment and PSNR.

0042627778	Motion-vector based adaptive quantization in MPEG-4 fine granular scalable coding	Selective enhancement mechanism of Fine-Granular-Scalability (FGS) In MPEG-4 is able to enhance specific objects under bandwidth variation. A novel technique for self-adaptive enhancement of interested regions based on Motion Vectors (MVs) of the base layer is proposed, which is suitable for those video sequences having still background and what we are interested in is only the moving objects in the scene, such as news broadcasting, video surveillance, Internet education, etc. Motion vectors generated during base layer encoding are obtained and analyzed. A Gaussian model is introduced to describe non-moving macroblocks which may have non-zero MVs caused by random noise or luminance variation. MVs of these macroblocks are set to zero to prevent them from being enhanced. A segmentation algorithm, region growth, based on MV values is exploited to separate foreground from background. Post-process is needed to reduce the influence of burst noise so that only the interested moving regions are left. Applying the result in selective enhancement during enhancement layer encoding can significantly improves the visual quality of interested regions within an aforementioned video transmitted at different bit-rate in our experiments.

84892567637	Stable and real-time hand gesture recognition based on RGB-D data	Hand gesture recognition has attracted more interest in computer vision and image processing recently. Recent works for hand gesture recognition confronted 2 major problems. The former one is how to detect and extract the hand region from color-confusing background objects. The latter one is the expensive computational cost by considering the kinematic hand model with up to 27 degrees of freedom. This paper proposes a stable and real-time static hand gesture recognition system. Our contributions are listed as follows. First, to deal with color-confusing background objects, we take the RGB-D (RGB-Depth) information into account, where foreground and background objects can be segmented well. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine model is proposed, which utilizes the skin color and helps us extract the hand region robustly and accurately. Second, considering the principal direction of hand region is random, we introduce the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm to estimate and then compensate the direction. Finally, to avoid the expensive computational cost of traditional optimization, we design a fingertip filter and detect extended fingers via calculating their distances to palm center and curvature easily. Then the number of extended fingers will be reported, which corresponds to the recognition result. Experiments have verified the stability and high-speed of our algorithm. On the data set captured by the depth camera, our algorithm recognizes the 6 pre-defined static hand gestures robustly with average accuracy about 98.0%. Furthermore, the average computational time for each image (with the resolution 640×480) is 37ms, which can be extended to many real-time applications. © 2013 SPIE.

84892584615	HOG-based multi-scale motion detection	Real-time accurate motion detection is a key step for many visual applications, such as object detection, smart video surveillance and so on. Although lots of considerable research efforts have been devoted to it, it is still a challenging task due to illumination variation, etc. In order to enhance the robustness to illumination changes, many block-based motion detection algorithms are proposed. However, these methods usually neglect the influences of different block sizes. Furthermore, they cannot choose background-modeling scale automatically as environment changes. These weaknesses limit algorithm's flexibility and their application scenes. In the paper, we propose a multi-scale motion detection algorithm to benefit from different block sizes. Moreover, an adaptive linear fusion strategy is designed through analyzing the accurateness and robustness of background models at different scales. At detecting, the ratios of different scales would be adjusted as the scene changes. In addition, to reduce the computation cost at each scale, we design an integral image structure for HOG feature of different scales. As a result, all features only need to be computed once. Different out-of-door experiments are tested and demonstrate the performance of proposed model. © 2013 SPIE.

84892597316	Part-based set matching for face recognition in surveillance	Face recognition in surveillance is a hot topic in computer vision due to the strong demand for public security and remains a challenging task owing to large variations in viewpoint and illumination of cameras. In surveillance, image sets are the most natural form of input by incorporating tracking. Recent advances in set-based matching also show its great potential for exploring the feature space for face recognition by making use of multiple samples of subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel method that exploits the salient features (such as eyes, noses, mouth) in set-based matching. To represent image sets, we adopt the affine hull model, which can general unseen appearances in the form of affine combinations of sample images. In our proposal, a robust part detector is first used to find four salient parts for each face image: two eyes, nose, and mouth. For each part, we construct an affine hull model by using the local binary pattern histograms of multiple samples of the part. We also construct an affine model for the whole face region. Then, we find the closest distance between the corresponding affine hull models to measure the similarity between parts/face regions, and a weighting scheme is introduced to combine the five distances (four parts and the whole face region) to obtain the final distance between two subjects. In the recognition phase, a nearest neighbor classifier is used. Experiments on the public ChokePoint dataset and our dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method. © 2013 SPIE.

First, considering that skeleton positions in different actions at different time are similar, we adopt the Naive-Bayes-Nearest-Neighbor (NBNN) method for classification. Second, to avoid different but similar actions which would decrease recognition rate obviously, we present a hierarchical model and increase the recognition rate significantly. Third, for a real-time application, we apply the sliding window to buffer the input and the threshold presented by the ratio of the second nearest distance and the nearest distance to smooth the output. Our method also rejects undefined actions. Experimental results on the Microsoft Research Action3D dataset demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods both in recognition rate and computing speed.

The algorithm consists of two key elements: robust hard segmentation for trimap generation, and iterative transductive learning based image matting. The hard segmentation step is formulated as a Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimation problem, where we iteratively perform depth refinement and bi-layer classification to achieve optimal results. For image matting, we propose a transductive learning algorithm that iteratively adjusts the weights between the objective function and the constraints, overcoming common issues such as over-smoothness in existing methods. In addition, we present a new way to form the Laplacian matrix in transductive learning by ranking similarities of neighboring pixels, which is essential to efficient and accurate matting.

A novel asymmetric Laplacian matrix is also proposed to further relieve the over-smoothness. To optimize the matting problem, we adjust the constrain coefficients between the initialized alpha matte and the asymmetric Laplacian matrix iteratively to achieve accurate alpha mattes. Consequently, during the iteration, high confidence pixels maintain their refined alpha values, whereas low confidence ones are updated by their neighbors gradually.

84898831069	POP: Person re-identification post-rank optimisation	Owing to visual ambiguities and disparities, person re-identification methods inevitably produce sub optimal rank-list, which still requires exhaustive human eyeballing to identify the correct target from hundreds of different likely-candidates. Existing re-identification studies focus on improving the ranking performance, but rarely look into the critical problem of optimising the time-consuming and error-prone post-rank visual search at the user end. In this study, we present a novel one-shot Post-rank Optimization (POP) method, which allows a user to quickly refine their search by either 'one-shot' or a couple of sparse negative selections during a re-identification process. We conduct systematic behavioural studies to understand user's searching behaviour and show that the proposed method allows correct re-identification to converge 2.6 times faster than the conventional exhaustive search. Importantly, through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving significant improvement over the state-of-the-art distance metric learning based ranking models, even with just 'one shot' feedback optimisation, by as much as over 30% performance improvement for rank 1 re-identification on the VIPeR and i-LIDS datasets. © 2013 IEEE.

In this paper we propose a new strategy to transfer deformable part models (DPMs) for object detection, using offline-trained auxiliary DPMs of similar categories as source models to improve the performance of the target object detector. A DPM presents an object by using a root filter and several part filters. We use these filters of the auxiliary DPMs as prior knowledge and adapt the filters to the target object.

84904300522	Detection of user-registered dog faces	Dog face detection is an important object detection task, widely applied in many fields such as auto-focus and image retrieval. In many applications, users only care about specific target species, which are unknown to a detection system until the users register some relevant information like a limited number of target samples. We call this scenario the detection of user-registered dog faces. Due to the great variation between different dog species, no single model can describe all the species well. Meanwhile, it is also impractical to learn individual models for every potential target species that the users may care about, given the large number of dog species. Furthermore, the registered samples are usually too few to train a robust detector directly. In this context, we propose a novel user-registered object detection framework. This framework can generate an adaptive detector, from only a limited number of user-registered target samples and a couple of off-line trained auxiliary models. In addition, we build an annotated dog face dataset, which contains 10,712 images of 32 species. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection performance to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The ARQ technique was used to recover damaged data when residual errors exist. Simulation results show that the scheme has three advantages: 1) good reconstructed images can be obtained even without the ARQ technology; 2) a few retransmissions can give error-free image transmission, which shortens the image service period; 3) QoS-guarantee image communication can be assured with a smaller bit budget, which effectively reduces the energy consumed in the network interface.

10044277927	Error robust scalable audio streaming over wireless IP networks	Streaming high-fidelity audio over wireless Internet protocol (IP) networks is a challenging task because the networks present not only packet losses, but also residual bit errors. These losses and errors have severe adverse effect on the compressed audio bitstream. To solve this problem, this paper introduces error resilience in conjunction with error protection for scalable audio streaming over wireless networks. Specifically, error resilience is achieved by performing bitstream data partitioning and reversible variable length coding in the audio coder. Error protection is provided by layered product channel code to simultaneously handle packet losses and residual bit errors. Both the row and column codes of the product code provide unequal error protection for different layers of the audio bitstream by considering the characteristics of the scalable audio. Rate-distortion optimization is performed to determine the best source-channel coding tradeoff that minimizes the average expected end-to-end distortion. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
