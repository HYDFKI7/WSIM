15744382003	Synthesizing new silica membrane by biomimepic technology	Based on templating technique, CTAB templated silica membranes were prepared repeatedly under optimized experimental conditions. The results of pore size distribution determination show that the silica membrane has modal pore size in 1.8 nm, which corresponds to the size of CTAB micelles, and its averaged pore diameter is 5.3 nm. Compared with the membrane prepared with sol-gel process, its pore size distribution wasn't influenced by the highest calcining temperature. Broad-angle X-ray diffraction pattern result shows that silica composing channel walls is non-crystalline structure, and only one broad diffraction peak appears in the narrow-angle XRD pattern of silica membrane, which further indicates that its pore channels construct a non-organized 3D network.

33645791577	Cluster-glass state in manganites induced by a -site cation-size disorder	The dependence of magnetotransport behaviors on A -site disorder induced by A -site cational size mismatch in ferromagnetic manganites is investigated by characterizing a series of samples with the same A -site cational mean radius rA =1.20 but different A -site ionic radii variance σ2 = i xi ri2 - rA 2, where xi and ri are the atomic fraction and ionic radii of i -type ions at A -site, respectively. It is revealed that the ground state transits from ferromagnetic metal to cluster-glass insulator upon increasing the variance σ2 from 0.0003 for La0.55 Ca0.45 Mn O3 to 0.015 for Sm0.55 (Ca0.6 Ba0.4) 0.45 Mn O3, while the crystallographic structure and lattice constants of these manganites remain unchanged. Nevertheless, the increasing A -site disorder is believed to enhance the random local radial distortion of Mn O6 octahedra and suppress the ferromagnetic long-range order. In the manganites of high A -site disorder, the long-range ferromagnetic ordering is completely melted into the short-range magnetically ordered clusters and then the stepwise magnetization. With decreasing temperature, the short-range ordered clusters become frustrated at the frustrating point, below which a cluster-glass transition occurs due to the weak intercluster interaction. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646879425	Interactions between building integrated photovoltaics and microclimate in urban environments	BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics) has progressed in the past years and become an element to be considered in city planning. BIPV has significant influence on microclimate in urban environments and the performance of BIPV is also affected by urban climate. The thermal model and electrical performance model of ventilated BIPV are combined to predict PV temperature and PV power output in Tianjin, China. Then, by using dynamic building energy model, the building cooling load for installing BIPV is calculated. A multi-layer model AUSSSM of urban canopy layer is used to assess the effect of BIPV on the Urban Heat Island (UHI). The simulation results show that in comparison with the conventional roof, the total building cooling load with ventilation PV roof may be decreased by 10%. The UHI effect after using BIPV relies on the surface absorptivity of original building. In this case, the daily total PV electricity output in urban areas may be reduced by 13% compared with the suburban areas due to UHI and solar radiation attenuation because of urban air pollution. The calculation results reveal that it is necessary to pay attention to and further analyze interactions between BIPV and microdimate in urban environments to decrease urban pollution, improve BIPV performance and reduce cooling load.

33745148298	Influence of a building's integrated-photovoltaics on heating and cooling loads	Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) has the potential to become a major source of renewable energy in the urban environment. BIPV has significant influence on the heat transfer through the building envelope because of the change of the thermal resistance by adding or replacing the building elements. Four different roofs are used to assess the impacts of BIPV on the building's heating-and-cooling loads; namely ventilated air-gap BIPV, non-ventilated (closed) air-gap BIPV, closeroof mounted BIPV, and the conventional roof with no PV and no air gap. One-dimensional transient models of four cases are derived to evaluate the PV performances and building cooling-and-heating loads across the different roofs in order to select the appropriate PV building integration method in Tianjin, China. The simulation results show that the PV roof with ventilated air-gap is suitable for the application in summer because this integration leads to the low cooling load and high PV conversion efficiency. The PV roof with ventilation air-gap has a high time lag and small decrement factor in comparison with other three roofs and has the same heat gain as the cool roof of absorptance 0.4. In winter, BIPV of non-ventilated air gap is more appropriate due to the combination of the low heating-load through the PV roof and high PV electrical output. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

33646508119	Numerical analysis of fiber Bragg grating under inhomogeneous strain fields	The spectrum of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) in inhomogeneous strain fields is distorted due to its inhomogeneity of both the periods and the effective refractive index. The coupling mode theory and Runge-Kuta method can be employed to exactly simulate the spectrum of FBG in such fields, but the convergence speed is slow. On the other hand, although the transfer matrix method could be used instead for higher convergence speed, the precision is poor because of the neglect of the grads of strain change. By improving the FBG equivalent period, a novel simulation method based on modified transfer matrix method is proposed, which has the advantage of quick-convergence as well as good accuracy.

33748215078	Interactions between Building Integrated Photovoltaics and microclimate in urban environments	BIPV(Building Integrated Photovoltaics) has progressed in the past years and become an element to be considered in city planning. BIPV has influence on microclimate in urban environments and the performance of BIPV is also affected by urban climate. The effect of BIPV on urban microclimate can be summarized under the following four aspects. The change of absorptivity and emissivity from original building surface to PV will change urban radiation balance. After installation of PV, building cooling load will be reduced because of PV shading effect, so urban anthropogenic heat also decreases to some extent. Because PV can reduce carbon dioxide emissions which is one of the reasons for urban heat island, BIPV is useful to mitigate this phenomena. The anthropogenic heat will alter after using BIPV, because partial replacement of fossil fuel means to change sensible heat from fossil fuel to solar energy. Different urban microclimate may have various effects on BIPV performance that can be analyzed from two perspectives. Firstly, BIPV performance may decline with the increase of air temperature in densely built areas because many factors in urban areas cause higher temperature than that of the surrounding countryside. Secondly, the change of solar irradiance at the ground level under urban air pollution will lead to the variation of BIPV performance because total solar irradiance usually is reduced and each solar cell has a different spectral response characteristic. The thermal model and performance model of ventilated BIPV according to actual meteorologic data in Tianjin(China) are combined to predict PV temperature and power output in the city of Tianjin. Then, using dynamic building energy model, cooling load is calculated after BIPV installation. The calculation made based in Tianjin shows that it is necessary to pay attention to and further analyze interaction between them to decrease urban pollution, improve BIPV Performance and reduce colling load.

33750038600	Effect of urban climate on building integrated photovoltaics performance	It is generally recognized that BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics) has the potential to become a major source of renewable energy in the urban environment. The actual output of a PV module in the field is a function of orientation, total irradiance, spectral irradiance, wind speed, air temperature, soiling and various system-related losses. In urban areas, the attenuation of solar radiation due to air pollution is obvious, and the solar spectral content subsequently changes. The urban air temperature is higher than that in the surrounding countryside, and the wind speed in urban areas is usually less than that in rural areas. Three different models of PV power are used to investigate the effect of urban climate on PV performance. The results show that the dimming of solar radiation in the urban environment is the main reason for the decrease of PV module output using the climatic data of urban and rural sites in Mexico City for year 2003. The urban PV conversion efficiency is higher than that of the rural PV system because the PV module temperature in the urban areas is slightly lower than that in the rural areas in the case. The DC power output of PV seems to be underestimated if the spectral response of PV in the urban environment is not taken into account based on the urban hourly meteorological data of Sao Paulo for year 2004. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

PTEBU model is forced with temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation above the roof level and incorporates detailed data of PV system and urban canyon in Tianjin, China.

The results show that with the increase of air temperature the rate of heat transfer increases, but the drying rate in the second falling period is decreased, which causes higher final water mass fraction in soft capsules; with the increase of the air velocity both the heat transfer rate and the drying rate in the first falling period increases, and the final water mass fraction of soft capsules is slightly dropped; the change of hot air humidity has very small influenced on heat transfer, but the drying rate raises as decreasing the air humidity, which leads to the obvious dropping of final water mass fraction in soft capsules.

34047181110	Theoretical and experimental study on etched fiber Bragg grating cladding mode resonances for ambient refractive index sensing	The theoretical model of etched fiber Bragg grating (FBG) backward cladding-mode resonances for ambient refractive index sensing is presented. The dependent behaviors of the mode resonances have been analyzed in the etching process and the ambient refractive index changed. The analysis is based on the classical coupling-mode theory while considering interactions among multiple modes and developed on a three-layer step-index fiber geometry. Experimental data match the theoretical model wonderfully. This model not only describes the relationship between the FBG backward cladding-mode resonances and the ambient index but also is valuable for the design of a flexible highly sensitive ambient index sensor. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

34547277431	Asymmetric transverse-load characteristics and polarization dependence of long-period fiber gratings written by a focused CO<inf>2</inf> laser	Asymmetric transverse-load characteristics and the polarization dependence of long-period fiber gratings (LPFGs) written by high-frequency CO<inf>2</inf> laser pulses are investigated in detail. It is demonstrated that the resonant wavelength is dependent on the direction of the applied force and on the polarization state of the input light; however, the coupling strength is independent of these parameters. When a transverse load is applied along different orientations of the LPFG, the resonant wavelength may be shifted toward the longer wavelength, the shorter wavelength, or hardly shifted, whereas the absolute value of peak transmission attenuation is linearly decreased with an increase of the applied transverse load, with almost no sensitivity to the load direction. These unique transverse-load characteristics and the polarization dependence are due to the load-induced birefringence that leads to the rotation of optical principal axes in the LPFG. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

De-ionized (DI) water, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ethyl acetate, and dimethyl silicon oil were selected as potential immersion liquids based on optical transmittance measurement results. Improvements to the electrical performance of silicon CPV cells were observed under a range of concentrations in the candidate dielectric liquids, arising from improved light collection and reduced cell surface recombination losses from surface adsorption of polar molecules. Three-dimensional numerical simulations with the four candidate liquids as the working fluids, exploring the thermal performance of a silicon CPV cell array in a liquid immersion prototype receiver, have been performed. Simulation results show that the direct-immersion cooling approach can maintain low and uniform cell temperature in the designed liquid immersion receiver. The fluid inlet velocity and flow mode, along with the fluid thermal properties, all have a significant influence on the cell array temperature. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

72149133426	Accelerated ultraviolet test and high temperature test on dielectric liquid for immersing solar cells	Solar cells immersed in dielectric liquid have an increased operating efficiency, and the cells can be cooled effectively by liquid. It is particularly important to the concentrated photovoltaic power system, as in the concentrated system excessive heat can generated due to high intensity irradiation, which can easily result in cell's degradation due to experience high temperature. So we introduced a new active cooling method: direct contact heat transfer mode by immerging solar cells in dielectric liquid. In the immersed system both the front and back surface of the cells can be contact with liquid directly so that cells can be cooled more effectively than passive and conventional active cooling methods. But there is no study on the durability and stability of dielectric liquid immersing solar cells. Photon induced degradation may take place when cells operating in dielectric liquid for a long time. In order to apply this new method to practice, the system's durability and stability must be studied. Accelerated ultraviolet test and high temperature (85°C) test were done on three dielectric liquids (such as silicon oil, glycerol) to test the liquid's durability. Fourier transform infrared spectra indicate their molecule structures did not change, but some physical changes have happened.

A small scale experimental system was set up. The collector temperature, the seawater temperature, and the temperature and humidity of the airflow under the collector were measured. Thermal network analysis of the system was carried out. The results show that the airflow is nearly saturated at the entrance of the chimney, and the mean dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures of the airflow have increased by 8.4°C and 9.6°C, respectively. The radiation heat transfer between the collector and the sky is the biggest heat loss in the system, which is up to 29.1% on average of the solar energy. However, the water evaporation heat is about 23.6% on average of the solar energy. To reduce the heat loss and enhance the water evaporation, it is necessary to reduce the emissivity and thermal conductivity of the collector and increase the evaporation areas. © Tianjin University and Springer-Verlag 2009.

77953127983	Very low temperature radiant heating/cooling indoor end system for efficient use of renewable energies	Solar or solar-assisted space heating systems are becoming more and more popular. The solar energy utilization efficiency is high when the collector is coupled with indoor radiant heating suppliers, since in principle, lower supply temperature means lower demand temperature and then the system heat loss is less. A new type radiant end system is put forward for even lower supply temperature compared to the conventional radiant floor heating systems. A three dimensional model was established to investigate its energy supply capacities. Simulation results show that 50 W per meter length tube can be achieved with the medium temperature of 30 °C for heating and 15 °C for cooling. The predicted results agree well with the actual data from a demonstration building. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a supply temperature of 22 °C in winter and of 17 °C in summer already met the indoor requirements. The new end system has good prospects for effective use of local renewable resources. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present paper, a plastic film heat recovery ventilator that works under cross-flow mode was developed. The thin film vibrates when airflow passes through the channels, which enhances heat exchange performance. Experiments, as well as theoretical analyses, were carried out to study the performance of such a unit. Results show that the effectiveness of the heat exchanger varies from 0.65 to 0.85 with airflow rate and the pressure drop is less than 20.0 Pa. Film vibration induced by airflow can improve heat transfer.

The measurements were carried out with the Differential ImageMotionMonitor (DIMM), and a total of 9259 data sets was obtained. The median seeing was measured to be 1.1", with 25% being better than 0.8"and 75% better than 1.5". The experiment shows that the DIMM exposure time has significant effects on the results of seeing measurements. An SBIG Polaris seeing monitor, which had been planned to be installed on the LAMOST site for long-term monitoring, was also employed during the DIMM observations. The results show that the SBIG seeingmonitor is easily affected by gusty wind, resulting in larger seeing values. Considering the previous seeing measurements at Xinglong station over the last 15 yr, we conclude that an acceptable seeing condition at Xinglong station is around 1"-2".

The evolution of the PDL with wavelength with respect to transversal pressure is studied theoretically and experimentally. A theoretical model for transversal pressure sensing by use of PDL is built and numerical simulation is also carried out. The theoretical analysis suggests that the PDL of FBG is more suitable for measuring transverse pressure than single spectral analysis in the low pressure region because of its greater sensitivity. Under the transverse pressure conditions of 0-180 N, the demodulation is realized by use of the centroid height and the wavelength spacing of the two peaks respectively. The resolutions of 0.06 dB/N for small pressure (0-80 N) and 2.5 pm/N for large pressure (81-180 N) are demonstrated.

The results show that the harmonic characteristics of nonlinear loads in low voltage distribution system are correlated to harmonic distortion of supply voltages. The voltage crest factor was proposed as the index in this paper to estimate the attenuation effect. The relationship between harmonics generated by nonlinear loads and the voltage crest factors is linearly incremental. Harmonic characteristic analysis for nonlinear loads in residential power system implied that almost all of the harmonic currents of nonlinear loads intend to flatten their supply voltage waveforms. This conclusion is also verified by measured voltage waveforms. Furthermore, it indicates that the main factor causing supply-voltage distortion is the installation of the massive distributed harmonic sources in distribution system. © 2011 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84866480025	3D numerical simulation on heat transfer performance of a cylindrical liquid immersion solar receiver	Liquid immersion cooling for a cylindrical solar receiver in a dish concentrator photovoltaic system has been experimentally verified to be a promising method of removing surplus heat from densely packed solar cells. In the present study, a three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation model of the prototype was established for better understanding the mechanism of the direct-contact heat transfer process. With the selection of standard k-turbulent model, the detailed simulation results of velocity field and temperature characteristics were obtained. The heat transfer performance of two structural modules (bare module and finned module) under actual weather conditions was simulated. It was found that the predicted temperature distribution of the two structural modules at the axial and lateral direction was in good agreement with the experimental data. Based on the validated simulation model, the influence of liquid flow rate and module geometric parameters on the cell temperature was then investigated. The simulated results indicated that the cell module with fin height of 4 mm and fin number of 11 has the best heat transfer performance and will be used in further works. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869867413	The performance and long-term stability of silicon concentrator solar cells immersed in dielectric liquids	Direct liquid-immersion cooling of concentrator solar cells was proposed as a solution for receiver thermal management of concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems. This research investigates the performance and long-term stability of silicon CPV solar cells operated in De-ionized (DI) water, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), dimethyl silicon oil, and ethyl acetate, respectively. Current-voltage characteristics of silicon CPV solar cells are measured. The presence of a thin liquid layer (1.5 mm) results in an increase in the silicon CPV solar cells efficiency by 8.5-15.2% from the reference value. With an increase of the liquid layer thickness above the cell surface up to 9 mm, due to more incident light is absorbed by the thicker liquid layer, the degree of the improvements to the cell efficiency decreases, which also depends to a noticeable degree on the liquid species. Further, more power output from the cells operated in liquids is achieved under higher concentration ratio. The long-term cell performance is discussed through three separate liquid immersion tests. The results from 1.5 mm test demonstrate that degradation of cells performance immersed in IPA and in ethyl acetate mainly occurs by a decrease of J

84875876637	The effect of vibration on a new fresh air heat exchanger	With the increasing of building energy consumption, the envelope of the buildings is becoming tighter to save energy. But this really causes the indoor air quality (IAQ) a problem for less infiltration, and as a result, people living in such buildings are showing a series of morbidities. To elevate the indoor air quality (IAQ), lots of fresh air should be taken indoor, thus will increase the energy consumption correspondingly. Fresh air exchanger which is devoted to indoor air quality (IAQ) and save energy at the same time is developed. Some researches proved that recycling the indoor air's energy generally can save 70-80% energy, and the economic value is great. In this paper, a new type of fresh air exchanger using plastic membrane as heat exchanger is presented, it weights light while costs less. Because the velocity of air in the air-air exchanger is low, its flow belongs to the range of laminar flow, and thermal resistance mostly relies on boundary layer. Experiments are carried out to research vibration's effect on the boundary layer. Lots of experiments present that the heat exchanged through plastic membrane can be enhanced by the vibration resulted from fluid flow. It is proved that this type of fresh air heat exchanger can improve the ratio of system performance and cost, and enhance the recovery percentage and have a long-term market outlook.

84875893772	Higher performance of silicon solar cells immersed in dielectric liquid	The efficiency of common silicon solar cells can be improved by immersing in dielectric liquid. Compared with the solid EVA in solar cell modules, the liquid contacting the surface of solar cells can supply better heat transfer performance. Firstly, the electric performance of bare cells, cells with oxide film and cells in different liquid were tested. As a result, the cells in liquid work the best in these conditions and liquid cells in silicon oil can work better than in other liquid. The main reason of improved efficiency is that the reflected radiation is reduced and the temperature at the surface of solar cells can be effectively lowered when heat is removed by liquid natural convection, and last the electric field at front and back surface of cells will reduce the carrier recombination. Secondly, low concentrated sunlight solar cell immersed system has been established in which solar radiation was directed to a single linear receiver by an array of mirror strips. The performance of solar cells has been studied. Due to an efficiency increase in liquid, the solar cells have an improved capability in low concentrated system. As a result, Due to low cost of the concentrated sunlight system and improved performance of solar cells, it is economic for the whole system.

Therefore, a fault diagnosis method of HVCBs based on Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is proposed in this paper. As the fault data of HVCBs have the characteristic of multi-dimensional nonlinearity, the proposed method calculates inner kernel function of HVCBs' closing current in the original data space so as to achieve nonlinear mapping to the feature space of the original data. Afterwards, feature extraction and pattern classification of fault data can be accomplished in the feature space by means of monitoring SPE statistics. Experiment results have proved that the KPCA method can effectively improve the precision of fault diagnosis of HVCBs. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

This research investigates the electrical performance of silicon concentrator solar cells under concentration, which are in both the absence of the candidate immersion liquids and also within different thickness on top. The results show that the presence of thin liquid layers results in an increase in the silicon CPV solar cells efficiencies by 8.5-15.2% from the reference value, arising from a decrease in a part of the reflected radiation and a decrease in the velocity of the surface recombination from surface adsorption of polar molecules. With an increase in the thickness of the liquid layer, the degree of the improvements to the efficiencies of the cells decreases due to more incident light is absorbed by the thicker liquid layer, which also depends to a noticeable degree on the liquid species. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The results showed that both silicone A and silicone B exhibited excellent optical transparency over the spectrum that silicon solar cells absorb strongly. The spectral transmittance of silicone A and silicone B was essentially unchanged after exposure DI water at room temperature for 130 days. However, the results indicated that there was a little change in the transmittance of silicone A over 300~400 nm during damp heat test, but not found in thermal cycling exposure. The decrease in transmittance of silicone B over 300~450 nm was detected both in damp heat and thermal cycling exposures. The transmittance of both silicone A and silicone B in UV-Vis wavelength after exposure to accelerated aging tests was still higher than that of EVA. Furthermore, it was identified that silicone B has a higher capacity to absorb moisture than the silicone A. The moisture could scatter the incident light during transmittance measurement, thus reduced the transmittance of the silicone samples.

84882768530	Effect of dielectric liquids immersion on electrical characteristics of silicon concentrator solar cell	The electrical characteristics of silicon concentrator solar cells were examined under 10X-30X concentration through constant voltage I-V flash tester, which are in both the absence of the candidate immersion liquids and also within different liquid thickness on top. The candidate immersion liquids include de-ionized water, isopropyl alcohol and dimethyl silicon oil. The results showed that improvements to the electrical performance of silicon concentrator solar cells are observed as the liquid film presence and the biggest percentage change is 15.2%, arising from reduction in reflection and reduced cell surface recombination losses from surface adsorption of polar molecules. With increase in the liquid thickness, the extent of the improvement to the efficiencies of the cells operated in liquids decreases. This is because more light is absorbed by the liquid when cells operated in thicker candidate liquids. Furthermore, more power output from the cells operated in liquids is achieved under higher concentration ratio.

0142011498	DFT and MM calculation: The performance mechanism of pour point depressants study	Adding pour point depressants (PPDs) to lower the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of oils has been widely used as the most valuable way in the world. To develop the new type of PPDs according to the oils of different kinds, many researchers have tried to study the performance mechanism of PPDs with different methods. In this article, we have carried out this study with density function theory and molecular mechanics calculation methods. From the results of different systems, we have found that: (1) Alkane molecule is non-polar but the methyl groups on the chain ends have higher electronegativity than all the methylene groups. (2) The EVA (copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate) molecule is divided into segments by the polar groups, and the segments are composed of carbon chains, while at the joint points of the segments are ester groups. Calculation results show that the non-polar parts of EVA molecule have good affinity to the adjacent alkane molecules. The rigidity of the carbon bonds neighboring to ester groups is enhanced by the introduction of ester groups, which can also help the next segments to get into the next crystal units and accelerate the growth rate of the planes perpendicular to (001) plane. (3) The alkane molecules absorbed on the PPD molecules can be bent, and the bending conformation brings steric hindrance effect to the molecules to deposit on the surface near the PPD molecules. The relatively higher electronegativity of the methyl groups, which are bent out of the crystal units, can also bring more repulsion effect to the alkane molecules to deposit. This helps to restrict the high growing velocity of (001) plane and results in the uniformity growing rate in three dimensions. (4) If we want to get the good performance properties of PPDs, the carbon number should be a little lower than the mean carbon number of the wax crystals. Then the acetate percent of EVA molecules should be around 30% and the concrete value should be determined according to the oils used. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84896477423	Selective-fluid-filled photonic crystal fibers and applications	A selective-filling technique was demonstrated to improve the optical properties of photonic crystal fibres (PCFs). Such a technique can be used to fill one or more fluid samples selectively into desired air holes. The technique is based on drilling a hole or carving a groove on the surface of a PCF to expose selected air holes to atmosphere by the use of a micromachining system comprising of a femtosecond infrared laser and a microscope. The exposed section was immersed into a fluid and the air holes are then filled through the well-known capillarity action. Provided two or more grooves are fabricated on different locations and different orientation along the fibre surface, different fluids may be filled into different airholes to form a hybrid fibre. As an example, we filled half of a pure-silica PCF by a fluid with n=1.480 by carving a rectangular groove on the fibre. Consequently, the half-filled PCF became a bandgap-guiding structure (upper half), resulted from a higher refractive index in the fluid rods than in the fibre core, and three bandgaps were observed within the wavelength range from 600 to 1700 nm. Whereas, the lower half (unfilled holes) of the fibre remains an air/silica index-guiding structure. When the hybrid PCF is bent, its bandgaps gradually narrowed, resulted from the shifts of the bandgap edges. The bandgap edges had distinct bend-sensitivities when the hybrid PCF was bent toward different directions. Especially, the bandgaps are hardly affected when the half-filled PCF was bent toward the fluid-filled region. Such unique bend properties could be used to monitor simultaneously the bend directions and the curvature of the engineering structures. © 2013 SPIE.
