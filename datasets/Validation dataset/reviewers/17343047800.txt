84887310054	Comparison of combination mode of energy conservation for refrigerated car based on CFD numerical simulation	Accurate temperature control is the key to achieving high quality food in cold-chain transport, and the suppliers pursue the goal of energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and transportation cost reduction. This paper takes the short distance refrigerated truck as the research object and potatoes as the experimental goods, and then establishes the calculation model for solving the temperature distribution in the refrigerated compartment. Two kinds of fan cooling temperatures (0 and 3°C) and cargo areas under the "blanks on both two sides and middle" stack method were used to simulate the cooling process. According to the refrigerating unit power and best refrigerating temperature of goods, the optimal time interval was defined to open and close a cooling fan in the process of transportation. Taking the wind speed at the air conditioning outlet, air-conditioner temperature, refrigerated compartment, initial temperature of the cargo area, and the physical parameters of goods as the initial boundary conditions, a 3D numerical calculated model of the car body was built by using a porous model, which took the average values of the three directions (0, 90°, 135°) of wind speed as the actual wind velocity in a physical simulation. The unsteady numerical simulation methods of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were used to model the distribution of the temperature field in a refrigerated compartment with different stages of an opening and closing fan. The results showed that, based on the contour map of temperature field in different section of Z-axis direction, the increased rate of the cargo area temperature reduced gradually. It was suggested to add a piece of iron plate on the upper surface of the cooling fan motors, to enhance the flow strength of the front cold air and improve overall cooling rate in the goods. The change of average temperature and temperature distribution of the goods area were compared with the cooling stage and the natural convection stage. The data indicated that when the refrigeration temperature was 3°C and cooling plus closing time of cooling fan were both 10 minutes, the energy of 3.6×10

77950565334	Calibration method of leaf wetness sensor for cucumber in solar greenhouse	The Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD) is a key input factor of disease warning systems for crops in solar greenhouse. The leaf wetness sensors could automatically monitor LWD in real time. Since the interactions between microclimate and crops influence LWD, leaf wetness sensors should be calibrated in solar greenhouse conditions. In this study, the calibration method of leaf wetness sensor was developed with mini cucumber at fruit harvesting stage, and the experiment was conducted in the solar greenhouse during late summer and early autumn. The leaf wetness sensors were oriented at a 45° angle, and firstly the sensors was misted with water from a pipette, and then they were attached to the wet leaves. In these two different conditions, the dry/wetness threshold was determined. The monitoring results of different sensor deployments were compared, which included attaching to leaf margins, tips and lower surface and placing below the leave. The effects of rainy or non-rainy conditions on the measurement results were also investigated. The results showed that the dry/wetness threshold of "6" was obtained by attaching the sensors to the wet leaves, in this case, the monitoring effects were good and the errors were around 1 h; when the sensors were attached to leaf margins and tips, the monitoring accuracy (fraction of correct estimates) was around 0.75-0.83; furthermore, the monitoring effects in non-rainy conditions were better than rainy conditions. The results indicate that the calibration method for leaf wetness sensors can be used for monitoring leaf wetness duration of cucumber and meet the requirement of cucumber disease early warning system in solar greenhouse.

78149380975	Estimation model of leaf wetness duration based on canopy relative humidity for cucumbers in solar greenhouse	The leaf wetness duration (LWD) is a key input factor of disease warning systems for crops in solar greenhouses. The LWD estimation model based on canopy relative humidity (RH threshold model) is one of the easiest models. To calibrate and validate the model in real greenhouse conditions, the experiment was conducted in the solar greenhouse during late summer and early autumn with mini cucumber at fruit harvesting stage. The relative humidity (RH) data were obtained automatically at every five-minute interval. The trial-and-error method, average value method and the method based on frequency of leaf wetness were used to calibrate the RH threshold, and then RH thresholds were obtained including 90%, 89% and 93%, respectively. In addition, the calibration results were validated by root mean square error (RMSE), regression analysis and a series of error analysis indicators. The results showed that the estimation effects of trial-and-error approach and average value approach were better than the method based on frequency of leaf wetness, and the errors were around 1-2 h. Compared with the leaf wetness duration that was over 3 h, the monitoring effects of RH threshold model were acceptable. However, from the validation results, the estimation effects of average value approach were better than trial-and-error approach, which indicated that it was impossible to apply only one calibration method in practice. The calibration and validation methods and the estimation model of leaf wetness duration based on canopy relative humidity can be used for monitoring leaf wetness duration of cucumbers and meet the requirement of cucumber disease early warning systems in solar greenhouses.

79955948474	A data-driven model simulating primary infection probabilities of cucumber downy mildew for use in early warning systems in solar greenhouses	Treatment during the primary infection phase is essential for controlling cucumber downy mildew in solar greenhouses. An early warning model applicable to this phase would represent a foundation for early warning systems for managing the disease and reducing pesticide usage. Based on the input parameters that were both readily available and appropriately limited in number, EWMPICDW (early warning model for primary infection of cucumber downy mildew in solar greenhouses) was developed based on monitoring data, early warning theory and plant disease epidemiology. The elaboration of this model included clarification of the meaning of warning, monitoring the warning indicators, forecasting the warning situation, tracing the warning sources and controlling the warning situation. The definition of warning included disease occurrence (yes or no) and probability. Because the leaf wetness duration (LWD) played an important role in disease warning systems for crops in solar greenhouses and was difficult to monitor, the leaf wetness sensor and RH threshold model were investigated and combined to form a practical estimation solution for LWD. Within the warning situation forecasting model system, the infection condition and incubation early warning submodels received the most attention. The infection condition early warning submodel was developed by using a threshold method based on the combination of LWD and mean temperature in LWD. The temperature was chosen as the warning indicator for incubation, and the incubation early warning submodel was defined using nonlinear regression methods. The warning sources traceability algorithm was developed in relation to expert knowledge and in terms of a mode of disaster mitigation that involved cutting the disaster chain from the headstream. The method for controlling the warning situation was based on good agricultural practices (GAP). The early warning model was implemented as a system and was evaluated using data for 4 years at two sites in Beijing, China. The warnings can be provided more than 2 d before symptoms appear. Using EWMPICDW, a positive early warning is associated with a change in the chance of disease occurrence from 0.68 to 0.96. Accordingly, the probability of disease occurrence calculated for the early warning model was 96%. These results demonstrate that the data-driven model will support the development of early warning systems for primary infection by cucumber downy mildew in solar greenhouses. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In order to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of record keeping in vegetable production for small enterprises, we developed a mobile phone-based record-keeping system for vegetable production traceability (MPRSVT) in the field, based on mobile communication technology. The MPRSVT could collect and store the main information about agricultural production activities, including growth stage, transplanting, fertilization, irrigation, pesticide, harvest and so on, and upload the information to the back-end server in real-time. The uploaded data were stored into a database for further analysis and traceability. Finally, the system was installed and validated among 247 farmers from three agricultural production enterprises in Beijing. The compatibility test showed that the success rate was 87.5% on average among all the tested mobile phones. In addition, the MPRSVT had very good universality for the dominant mobile operating systems in China. Moreover, the usage cost assessment of the MPRSVT showed the transferring cost could be reduced by 4.6 RMB for one farmer-field during entire growing season of cucumber (0.1 RMB/per short messages).

84860849636	A deterministic sensor node deployment method with target coverage based on grid scan	The paper proposes a deterministic sensor node deployment method with target coverage based on grid scan. First, divide the area into grids. Then, choose the best grid to place the next sensor. Meanwhile, a probabilistic sensing model is introduced, the least sensing probability with which a node can sense a target is used to measure the whole coverage level, the evaluation of a grid is based on the amount of targets the node can sense and the least sensing probability with which it can sense the targets. The method can use the least nodes to achieve the target coverage, meet the required level of the whole coverage and get better positions for node deployment. Simulation experiments are done with different grid side sizes and different lower limits of sensing probability. Experiment results show that the node position is more accurate when the grid side size is smaller. The higher the lower limit of sensing probability is,the better the performance is, and more nodes are needed.

84863562857	Effects of different hanging methods of RFID tags on reading rate in fruit tree	RFID plays an appropriate role for single fruit tree identification, however its position of hanging on the tree affects the reading rate significantly. In this study, test environment was established in an apple orchard of Shandong province. The times of successful reading was obtained according to four treatment conditions, which were different distance between RFID tags and reader antennas (condition1), different vertical hanging height on the fruit trees (condition2), different horizontal hanging distance on the fruit trees (condition3) and different shades in the front of tags (condition4). The results showed that the times of successful reading reduced gradually with the increasing distance between RFID tags and reader antennas. The reading effect was sound in the range of 2.0 m, but there was a marked drop with 50% reading rate in the ranges of 3.0 m and 3.5 m. The decline in reading rate was shown in condition2 and condition3, as the distance between RFID tags and plane center line of reader antennas increased. In condition4, the times of successful reading with branch shade was higher than the times with fruit shades, but lower than the times of leaf shades. Based on the results, the optimum hanging position was: the tags hung on the side branch near the row space, which was 1.2-1.4 m higher than the ground and faced to the row space without shades.

84865360850	Assessment of spoilage progress for chilled tilapia fillets according to biogenic amines changes	In order to explore the possibility and safety ranges of biogenic amines indicators for evaluating fish spoilage progress, reversed-phase high-performance-liquid-chromatography method was employed to detect the biogenic amines changes of tilapia fillets during chilled storage. The results showed that initial content of monoamines and polyamines in fresh fillets was high, and those of diamines was low. During chilled storage, monoamines and polyamines content showed fluctuating and decreasing trend. Cadaverine and putrescine content were decreased quickly and became the major biogenic amines. The cadaverine and putrescine relative indicators like diamines, biogenic amines index and total biogenic amines showed a similar increasing trend of cadaverine and putrescine. The correlation analysis showed that there were high correlation among cadaverine, putrescine, diamine, biogenic amines index, total biogenic amines with storage time, microbial counts and amine nitrogen. The regression analysis indicated that the relationship among the growth of pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae and cadaverine and putrescine was inseparable. The indicators of cadaverine, putrescine and diamine could be used for evaluating fillet spoilage progress simply and effectively. Considering the toxicity of histamine and tyramine, biogenic amines index (BAI) were more suitable. The preliminary range of BAI for evaluating spoilage progress of chilled tilapia fillets were as follows: <20 mg/kg, fresh; 20-40 mg/kg, acceptable; >40 mg/kg, spoiled. These results would offer the basic data for standard limits of biogenic amines in chilled tilapia fillets.

84867267820	Propagation characteristics of 2.4 GHz wireless channel at different heights in apple orchard	For configuring WSN system and node deployment in apple orchards, the paper focused on signal strength attenuation and packet loss rate of 2.4 GHz wireless channel in different heights in apple orchard when the apples were mature. The field test was conducted along a line of apple trees with the height from 0.5 meters at the trunk level to the top of canopy about 3 meters high. At each height, receiving signal strength and packet loss rate were tested for ten different distances. Regression analysis results showed that 2.4 GHz wireless channel loss accords with logarithm distance path loss model, and the correlation coefficients between computational values and measurement values were between 0.915 and 0.983. When the height was between 1 and 2.25 meters, the signal attenuation rate was larger than the other heights. When the height was higher than 2.25 meters, the signal attenuation rate became slower with the increase of height until 3 meters when the signal attenuation rate was the smallest. So in apple orchard, it's best to place the antennas at the top of the canopy or above of it, followed at higher place above 2.25 meters. Besides, a model used for calculating the received signal strength of 2.4 GHz transmitting through mature apple orchard was constructed. Validation results show that the model can better predict the received signal strength at different distance point at different height. This research can provide a reference for WSNs application.

84871499242	A simple and practical incremental node deployment method in wireless sensor networks	The paper proposes an incremental manual deployment method for target coverage and node connectivity based on grid scan. The coverage level and connectivity level are proposed for the first time to characterize the desired coverage and connectivity degree. In coverage phrase, the grid where the sensor can cover the most targets with the best whole coverage level is selected to place the next sensor. In connectivity phrase, firstly, sensors generated in coverage phrase are divided into groups each of which is connected. Then, grids are selected to lay relay nodes to connect sensor groups. It is a very simple and practical deterministic deployment for monitoring fixed targets. Simulation experiment results show that the sensor number increase linearly with the coverage level when the coverage level is greater than a fixed value and that the increase speed rises with the target number. Besides, the higher the connectivity level is, the more sensor groups are and the more relay nodes are needed to connect the groups. ©2012 by Binary Information Press.

84892888425	Construction of index system for traceability granularity evaluation of traceability system	With the development of research and application of traceability systems, it plays a key role that the traceability system is established with appropriate granularity for deeper application according to the supply chain actual requirement and informatization level of subjects. The existing research in traceability width, depth, and accuracy were descriptive language, or lacked a quantitative evaluation model, which lead to the difference of the traceability system not being able to be measured well. In this paper, three layers of architecture of a basic traceability system were analyzed, which included product identification, information collection, and database construction of the center. The descriptive definition of traceability granularity was established with traceable unit size and its horizontal information capacity and longitudinal tracking depth. A two-layer index system was constructed with the core of traceability precision, width, and depth. The evaluation factors included a external traceability unit, an internal turning unit, an identification unit exchange, information collection content, information update frequency, forward tracing distance, and backward tracing distance. In order to eliminate qualitative indicators difficult to measure, a five point grading assignment method was used to obtain a qualitative index value. The evaluation factors' weight was confirmed using an AHP (analytic hierarchy process) method with three steps through investigation on 20 related areas experts. First, the initial judgment matrix and comparison matrix was established through the comparison of various elements. Secondly, a single order layer was taken. Finally, the final judgment matrix was obtained through the consistency test, and then all the target weights set were obtained. In the weights set, the external traceability unit weight was the highest with 0.1985.For the cooperative supply chain, an external traceability unit with the difference between a single product, single batch and the mixed batch, affected other unit sizes and information collection, so it played an important role in the whole index system. The lowest weight was an identification unit exchange with the value of 0.0872. Because the identification unit exchange had a correlation with an external traceability unit and an internal turning unit, the identification unit exchange had relatively less effects on traceability granularity with a determined internal and external unit. This research can provide quantitative evidence for evaluating the difference of traceability systems.
