According to the problem of incomplete fingerprint orientation, a novel algorithm of fingerprint orientation reinstatement is proposed based on Local binary pattern (LBP) and mutual information function. Firstly, mutual information of fingerprint orientation is computed. Secondly, the feature vector is defined for incomplete area classification by Support vector machines (SVM).

84899976009	An improved reconstruction method for compressive sensing based OFDM channel estimation	In the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, channel estimation is significant in that it affects the reliability of coherent detection at the receiver. Compressive sensing based channel estimation demands fewer pilots than traditional methods and improves the resource utilization in a great manner. Greedy algorithms have a weakness in terms of anti-noise capacity. Combining compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) with exponential smoothing, an improved reconstruction method is proposed in order to suppress noise. The noise suppression capacity of exponential smoothing is analyzed in theory. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is superior to CoSaMP especially for high noise or low speed situation at a cost of low additional computational complexity. © 2013 IEEE.

84900617135	P2P traffic identification based on transfer learning	With the rapid development of Internet, a large number of peer networks (Peer-to-Peer) applications rise and are widely used. Because of this, it is more difficult for network operators to manage and monitor their networks in a proper way. To identify the peer networks applications generating the traffic traveling through networks is necessary and if we can identify them sooner, we control them better. In this work, we use the machine learning-based classification method to identify the classes of the flows. According to previous work, we choose transfer learning algorithm to classify the traffic, and improve classified results. Finally we compare and evaluate the classification results in terms of the two metrics such as true positive ratio and time expense. Our experiments show that the machine learning algorithm is an efficient algorithm for traffic identification and is able to build a quick identification system. © 2013 IEEE.

84907360002	Compressed sensing of IR-UWB signals with waveform sparsity	Extremely high sampling rate is required for digital processing in impulse radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) system, and it is difficult to meet this requirement under the current level of the hardware chips. To reduce this sampling rate requirement, a waveform signal recovery method is proposed based on compressed sensing (CS) theory in this paper. The CS model for IR-UWB signal is developed based on measurement matrix whose entries satisfy with the logarithm normal distribution. In order to ensure the success of the CS recovery, the waveform domain transform of IR-UWB signal is developed to improve the sparsity of IR-UWB signal. Simulation results demonstrate that the sparse representation of the IR-UWB signal in waveform domain has better sparsity than the time-domain signal, and 1/15-1/20 of the Nyquist sampling rate will be sufficient to efficiently recover the IR-UWB signals.

84909953036	Bit allocation for quality scalability coding of H.264/SVC	An efficient model-based bit allocation algorithm, in this paper, is proposed for quality scalability coding of H.264/scalable video coding (SVC). The conventional Rate-Distortion models are not available for quality scalability coding of H.264/SVC. To overcome this issue, the relationship between the percentage of header bits and quantization parameter is investigated to obtain an accurate single layer rate model. Moreover, MGS/CGS inter-layer MAD affine relationship is employed to extend the Rate-Distortion models from the base layer (BL) to the enhancement layer (EL). Finally the Lagrange solution of the bit allocation problem is worked out. Experimental results show that the proposed bit allocation algorithm outperforms Joint Scalable Video Model (JSVM) software algorithm.

84910043255	A glowworm swarm optimization based multi-constraint multicast tree spanning algorithm	In communication networks, the multi-constraint multicast communication is an important way to improve the efficiency of network operation and quality of service. Some heuristic algorithms are applied in solving multicast routing problem under multiple constraints, such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, ant colony algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. However, these algorithms suffer from low convergence rate and high computational complexity in solving multi-constraint multicast routing problems. The glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm is a promising algorithm recently arisen, which can overcome such shortcomings. This paper proposes a GSO based multi-constraint multicast (GSO-MCM) algorithm, which can efficiently generate multicast routing tree to meet the multi-constraint requirements. The simulation result manifests that the GSO-MCM algorithm proposed in this paper performs well in searching, converging speed and adaptability scale.
