84941654391	On-Chip HbA<inf>1C</inf> detection utlizing a compact surface pla-smon grating sensor integrated on a microfldic system	Diabetes mellitus may cause serious complications, including arteriosclerosis, heart disease and kidney failure, and therefore requires routine monitoring. Increasing evidences show that the concentration of glycated hemoglobin (HbA<inf>1c</inf>) can be utilized as a more reliable index for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes. In this study, we presented a new approach using HbA<inf>1c</inf>-specific aptamers as recognition molecules due to its high affinity and specificity. Moreover, a compact, grating-based surface plasmon resonance sensor incorporated with a microfluidic system was proposed to implement a compact, non-contact optical detection scheme for measuring HbA<inf>1c</inf>.

84941660668	Rapid and sensitive measurement of glycated hemoglobin for diabetes monitoring by using a two-aptamer assay on an integrated microfluidic system	Diabetes requires an on-site routine monitoring on a daily basis. In this study, a compact, integrated microfluidic system capable of rapidly measuring the value of glycated hemoglobin (HbA<inf>1c</inf>) was reported. Since nucleic-acid aptamers with high sensitivity and specificity to hemoglobin and HbA<inf>1c</inf> were used, the two-aptamer assay can perform the detection of HbA<inf>1c</inf> within a short period of time. Furthermore, the microfluidic system is extended to parallel processing such that multiple assays can be realized on a single chip. Therefore, it may be promising for providing a diagnostic device for diabetes patients in the near future.

1542269094	Rapid Detection of K-ras Mutations in Bile by Peptide Nucleic Acid-mediated PCR Clamping and Melting Curve Analysis: Comparison with Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis	Background: Current methods for detection of K-ras gene mutations are time-consuming. We aimed to develop a one-step PCR technique using fluorescent hybridization probes and competing peptide nucleic acid oligomers to detect K-ras mutations in bile and to compare the efficacy with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Methods: Bile samples were obtained from 116 patients with biliary obstruction, including gallstones (n = 64), benign biliary strictures (n = 6), pancreatic cancer (n = 20), and cholangiocarcinoma (n = 26). The DNA was extracted and subjected to K-ras mutation analysis by real-time PCR and RFLP analysis. Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to the clinical results. Results: The analysis time for real-time PCR was <1 h, whereas RFLP analysis took more than 2 days. With the sensor probe designed for the GAT (G12D) mutant in codon 12 of the K-ras gene, the real-time PCR method also detected the GTT (G12V) mutant. In contrast, a specific sensor probe for the TGT (G12C) mutant detected GAT (G12D), AGT (G12S), and GTT (G12V) mutants in addition to the TGT mutant. The real-time PCR assay allowed the detection of mutation in a 3000-fold excess of wild-type bile DNA. In bile, K-ras codon 12 mutations were detected in 16 of 46 malignant cases by real-time PCR with the TGT probe and 15 by RFLP analysis. All benign cases were wild type. Conclusion: Real-time PCR with a cysteine-specific (TGT) sensor probe can rapidly detect K-ras gene mutations in bile and diagnose malignant biliary obstruction with high specificity. © 2004 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

18844443667	The value of biliary amylase and Hepatocarcinoma-Intestine-Pancreas/ Pancreatitis-associated Protein I (HIP/PAP-I) in diagnosing biliary malignancies	Background/Objectives: Elevated concentrations of Hepatocarcinoma-Intestine -Pancreas/Pancreatitis-associated Protein I (HIP/PAP-I) in pancreatic juice have been reported in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and have been considered as a promising tumor marker. This study was conducted to investigate whether biliary HIP/PAP-I can be used in the differential diagnosis of the cause of biliary obstruction. Methods: Bile was obtained from patients with bile duct obstruction on the day of biliary drainage. The etiology of biliary obstruction included gallstones (n = 131), pancreatic cancer (n = 32), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 47), papilla Vater cancer (n = 13), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 4) and metastatic cancer (n = 16). In addition to HIP/PAP-I, the samples were analyzed for amylase to check for the presence of pancreaticobiliary reflux. Results: The biliary concentration of HIP/PAP-I was not statistically different between patients with gallstones (median, 9.70 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR] 1.80-45.75) and cancers (median, 12.70 ng/mL; IQR, 3.85-36.75), P > 0.05. However, the amylase activity in the bile was markedly elevated in patients with gallstones (median, 228 U/L; IQR, 40-1965), compared to those with cancer (median, 32 U/L; IQR; 30-176), P < 0.001. The area under the ROC curve of amylase was 0.751 (95% CI: 0.69 to 0.81). At a cut-off value of 46 U/L, the biliary amylase distinguished patients with malignant obstruction from those with benign obstruction with a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 74%. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the biliary HIP/PAP-I measurement is not useful for differentiating causes of biliary obstruction. The divergent extent and duration of biliary obstruction caused by neoplasm and gallstones may contribute to the significant difference in the amylase activity in bile. Thus, amylase in bile represents a candidate marker in the differential diagnosis of the cause of biliary obstruction. © 2005 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. All rights reserved.

0029920865	Long-term outcome of triple therapy in Helicobacter pylori-related nonulcer dyspepsia: A prospective controlled assessment	Objective: To ascertain whether triple therapy alters the history of Helicobacter pylori (HP)-related nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). Methods: Forty- one young (<45 yr) dyspeptic patients were confirmed to be HP-related NUD by serology, rapid urease test, and antral biopsy. Endoscopy excluded the presence of ulcer. These cases were randomly plotted into control (n = 21) and triple therapy (n = 20) groups. In the former group, H2 blocker was given for 2 months and then intermittent antisecretory agents for up to 1 yr. In the latter group, 20 patients received a course of triple therapy and then were treated like the control group. The symptom scores (range: 0-10) were collected on enrollment, and at the end of 2nd, 6th, and 12th months. Each case had serial tests of HP IgG ELISA titer on start, at weeks 2, 4, and 8, at the 6th month, and at the end of the 1st yr. The second endoscopy was done in the 9th wk for eradication survey, and the third endoscopy, at the end of the 1st yr to resurvey the HP status. The histological gradings of biopsy specimens, sampled on each endoscopy, were compared. Results: In the triple therapy group, the rate of eradication of HP was 75%. At the end of the 2nd month, the HP-eradicated cases of the triple therapy group improved the symptom score more significantly than the noneradicated cases (2.42 ± 1.37 vs. 4.76 ± 1.58, p < 0.001). At the ends of the 6th month and 1st yr, the symptom scores of the eradicated cases improved more significantly than those of the control group (6th month, 0.61 ± 1.18 vs.] 2.66 ± 2.06; 1st yr, 0.82 ± 1.17 vs.] 3.56 ± 2.89, p < 0.001). The decline trend of ELISA titers occurred only in eradicated cases and became significantly evident from the 4th wk (0.30 ± 0.15 vs.] 0.49 ± 0.07, p < 0.05) and thereafter. Both acute and chronic pathological grading was improved in the triple group at the end of the 1st yr (acute, 1.95-0.46; chronic, 1.9-0.92; p < 0.01) Conclusion: Compared with control therapy at 1 yr, triple therapy showed greater symptomatic, serological, and histological improvements. Therefore, triple therapy is beneficial to symptomatic HP-related NUD.

0029998857	C-reactive protein for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain	The diagnostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP) was evaluated in 143 patients with acute abdominal pain, 67 men and 76 women with mean age of 48 ± 20 years old. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected after the patients' arrival at the emergency department. The attending clinicians did not consider the CRP value during the study period and did not use it for their management. When patients were grouped by final disposition, which was according to severity, only CRP and leukocyte count were identified as significant quantitative variables by multivariate analysis. CRP can detect the serious condition; ie, in 79% of the hospitalized group, although specificity was 64% the total accuracy was 73%. When elevated CRP was combined with leukocytosis, the diagnostic value was much improved, with specificity of 89% and positive predictive value of 88%. The sensitivity was improved to 90% when elevated CRP or leukocytosis was used. It is thus concluded that CRP is a helpful quantitative variable for disposition decision-making in patients with acute abdominal pain.

0029796414	Sequential changes of bile contents in patients with obstructive jaundice from different etiologies	Background/Aims: The decreasing of serum concentration of bilirubin and the ability of hepatocytes to excrete various biliary contents after release of obstructive jaundice are good indicators of recovery of liver function. We conducted this study to clarify whether different causes of obstructive jaundice have different effects on the biliary excretion and how they are different when obstruction is released. Patients and Methods: Fifteen patients with obstructive jaundice undergoing percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage or endoscopic nasobiliary drainage were classified into two groups, depending on the cause of obstruction: common bile duct stones (n = 7) and biliary tract tumors (n = 8). All patients in the gallstone group presented with acute cholangitis while only three patients in the tumor group had a positive bacteria culture in bile. Fasting biles were collected on the day of catheter placement and the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th day thereafter. The sequential changes of biliary concentration of bilirubin, phospholipid, cholesterol, bile salts and serum bilirubin were checked and compared between the true groups. Results: The difference in the improvement of jaundice between the stone and tumor group (p > 0.05) were not significant, nor were the excretion of biliary contents after relief of obstruction. The reduction of serum bilirubin paralleled with the increased excretion of biliary bile salts and bilirubin (γ = -0.51, p < 0.01 and γ = -0.4, P < 0.05) in tumor group, but not in the stone group. Conclusions: The decrease of serum bilirubin and the sequential changes of bile contents after relief of obstruction are quite similar in stone and tumor induced obstructive jaundice.

0030470305	Bacterial density of Helicobacter pylori predicts the success of triple therapy in bleeding duodenal ulcer	Background: We studied whether different initial bacterial densities of Helicobacter pylori would alter the eradication rate of H. pylori by triple therapy (amoxicillin 500 mg t.i.d. and metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. for 14 days; bismuth subcitrate 120 mg t.i.d. for 28 days) in patients with duodenal ulcer bleeding. Method: One hundred thirty-six cases with duodenal ulcer bleeding and H. pylori infection (proved by rapid urease test and histology during emergency endoscopy) were studied. One hundred twenty-seven of these patients completed a course of triple therapy. In each case, anti-H. pylori IgG titer, gastric biopsies for H. pylori density (score 1 to 5), and evaluation of severity of gastritis were collected at the first endoscopy and 1 month after completion of the triple therapy. Results: The ulcer healing rate was 84.3% (107 of 127) at the time of the second evaluation. The eradication rate of H. pylori was 76.4% (97 of 127). Eradication for H. pylori failed in 30 cases. In these eradication failure cases, initial serologic titer and density of H. pylori were higher than those of eradication success cases. The eradication rate of H. pylori decreased as the initial density of H. pylori increased (density of H. pylori: 1, 88.3%; 2, 83.8%; 3, 74.2%; 4, 68%; 5, 50%). At the second evaluation, the serologic titer was lower and continued to decline in eradication success cases whose mean residual titer ratio (100% x follow-up titer/initial titer) was lower than that of eradication failure cases (57.1% ± 14.6% vs 107.1% ± 24.1%, p < 0.001). The mean residual titer ratio also disclosed an upward trend as the density of H. pylori increased (density of H. pylori 1 to 5: 57.5%, 66.6%, 73.5%, 75.3%, 81.8%, respectively). Conclusions: We suggest routine gastric biopsy to detect both the presence of H. pylori and its density inasmuch as quantitative results may predict the usefulness of triple therapy. The higher the H. pylori density, the less effective triple therapy will be at successful eradication of H. pylori.

0031057931	Implications of Helicobacter pylori serological titer for the histological severity of antral gastritis	Background and Study Aims: We attempted to determine whether the serological titer of anti-Helicobacter pylori (HP) immunoglobulin (IgG) would be capable of predicting the presence of ulcer, or would correlate with the histological grading of gastritis in patients with dyspepsia. Patients and Methods: One hundred eighty-three dyspeptic patients were prospectively included in the study after panendoscopy. Each patient underwent blood sampling for anti-HP IgG titer, and antral biopsy for both a rapid urease test (CLO) and histology. The severity of antral gastritis was semi-quantitated for acute and chronic inflammation scores (range 0-3). Results: The HP findings were positive in 157 patients (85.5%), and their histological inflammation scores and serological titer were higher than those of HP-negative patients (P < 0.05). Based on the endoscopic findings, these 157 patients were classified into ulcer (n = 109) and non-ulcer dyspepsia (n = 48) subgroups. The mean chronic inflammation score in the ulcer subgroup was higher than that in the non-ulcer dyspepsia subgroup (1.77 vs, 1.28, P < 0.001). However, on the basis of only the titer itself, there was no cut-off value for serological titer to predict the presence or absence of ulcer in HP-infected patients. As the scores for either acute or chronic inflammation increased, the mean serological titer rose (acute inflammation score 0-3: 0.63, 0.78, 0.93, 1.39; chronic inflammation score 0-3: 0.18, 0.56, 0.88, 0.91). Conclusions: The titer of HP serology does not provide a method for predicting the presence of ulcer in patients with HP infection, but may indirectly offer evidence of the severity of histological changes.

0031683969	Evaluation of topographic gastric histology in H. pylori infection - A comparative study with CLO test and bacterial culture	Endoscopic biopsy is an effective method for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. This study sought to determine suitable biopsy locations and the optimal number of specimens for histology examination and to clarify the discrepancies among various invasive diagnostic tests. Forty- seven dyspeptic patients (25 M, 22 F) were topographically sampled for histology, mucosal rapid urease (CLO) test and bacterial culture. Based on histology, 34 patients (72.3%) had H. pylori infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the CLO test and culture were 91.2% and 100% and 79.4% and 100%, respectively. CLO test is known to be a reliable method for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. In this study, the distribution of H. pylori varied in the stomach and the uneven distribution of bacteria may be responsible for the discrepancy in the diagnostic yield. There were 3 patients with a low bacterial load which was confined to the angle or high body of the stomach and with negative CLO test in the antrum. We recommend that at least three biopsies for histology including the antrum of the lesser curvature side, angle and higher body (near cardia), should be sampled to improve the diagnostic accuracy of H. pylori infection and inflammation activity.

0031882258	Computer morphometry for quantitative measurement of liver fibrosis: Comparison with Knodell's score, colorimetry and conventional description reports	Liver fibrosis is currently described quite subjectively or, at best, semiquantitatively by scoring systems. In order to measure the severity of liver fibrosis quantitatively and to compare this with established methods, such as Knodell's scoring system, the colorimetric method and conventional description reports, we undertook the present study. A personal computer with an image grabber card and a microscope equipped with a computer-controlled slide-driver was used for computer morphometry. The principle behind morphometry is based on the different colours of hepatocytes and fibres following staining with Masson's trichrome stain. There were 31 patients (25 male, six female) recruited into the present study with a mean ± SD age of 41.6 ± 15 years (range 24-66 years). Of these patients, 16 had chronic hepatitis B, 12 had chronic hepatitis C and three were alcoholics. Colorimetric methods and Knodell's fibrosis score were performed according to established protocols. Conventional description reports were obtained from reviews of patient charts. The results from computer morphometry were highly correlated with results from the colorimetric method, with a correlation coefficiency γ = 0.85 (P < 0.0001). The results from computer morphometry also correlated with both Knodell's scoring system (γ = 0.69; P<0.001) and conventional description reports (γ = 0.46; P < 0.01). Results from Knodell's scoring system were significantly correlated with computer morphometry, as follows: score 0, 2.7 ± 1.4; score 1, 5.7 ± 1.2; score 2, 7.7 ± 2.3; score 3, 10.7 ± 3.2; score 4, 21.8 ± 14.1. The trend was statistically significant by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. In conclusion, our computerized morphometry system is a reliable tool for the evaluation of the severity of liver fibrosis and can be used as a tool for the objective quantification of liver fibrosis.

2342552469	Amperometric detection of morphine at a Prussian blue-modified indium tin oxide electrode	In this work, the electrocatalytic oxidation of morphine (MO) at an optically transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode modified by an electrodeposited Prussian blue (PB) thin film is first demonstrated, and the amperometric detection of MO was then investigated. Experimental results showed that the thin film on the ITO surface, confined to the PB/Berlin green (BG) redox pair, can serve as an excellent mediator which facilitates electron transfer and considerably lowers the overpotential required, as compared to a bare ITO electrode. Thus, PB can be regarded as a promising artificial peroxidase for MO. The rate of such an electrocatalytic reaction is pH dependent with the highest value at pH 5. By potential-step excitation from 0.55 to 0.70 V, a linear calibration curve, displaying the relationship between steady-state currents and MO concentrations (ranging from 0.09 to 1.0 mM), was obtained. The detection sensitivity is about 16.8 μA/cm

33646002654	Correlation of serum levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor with disease severity and clinical outcome in dengue patients	Dengue virus infection can cause mild dengue fever (DF) or severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Cytokines are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of dengue infection. However, the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in dengue infection is unclear. In this study, serum levels of MIF in adult dengue patients with different disease severity and clinical outcome were determined and compared with the levels of other cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), in the same patients. Serum levels of MIF, IL-6, and IL-10, but not IFN-γ or TNF-α, were higher in all DHF patients who died than in DHF survivors and DF patients. We conclude that in addition to IL-6 and IL-10, elevated levels of serum MIF are a potential predictor of disease severity and clinical outcome in dengue patients.

33646085353	Determination of C-reactive protein with an ultra-sensitivity immunochemiluminometric assay	C-reactive protein (CRP), the classic acute phase reactant, is strongly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. The demand for measuring serum CRP levels has been predicted to increase. We developed an ultra-sensitivity in-house immunometric assay on polystyrene beads for measuring CRP and studied its analytical and clinical performance. The assay used a pair of monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies and detected CRP in a 1-step immunometric assay with a chemiluminescence signal. The calibration was traceable to the World Health Organization reference material. The assay covered a linear range of 0.01 to 50.00 mg/L. The analytical detection limit calculated from the mean level plus 3 SD of the zero calibrator was 0.004 mg/L. The within-run imprecision was 7.0%, 5.2%, and 4.1% for mean CRP levels of 0.02 mg/L, 1.44 mg/L, and 11.04 mg/L, respectively. The between-run imprecision was 9.2%, 7.0%, and 6.0% for mean CRP levels of 0.02 mg/L, 1.49 mg/L, and 10.90 mg/L, respectively. The average recovery was 102.0% (n = 6). The assay correlated well with a high-sensitivity latex-enhanced nephelometric assay (regression line y = 0.865x + 1.333, r = 0.974, S

33646529141	Review: Serum C-reactive protein as a marker for wellness assessment	C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific inflammatory marker, is widely used to monitor treatment of cardiovascular diseases (high serum CRP levels indicate poor outcome of heart disease). A healthy lifestyle decreases serum CRP levels, while obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking increase them. CRP, a stable pentameric protein, has a half-life of 19 hr, is not subject to diurnal variation, and can serve as a marker of wellness and a candidate for future direct access testing for people monitoring their health after adopting a healthier lifestyle. The CRP level may be influenced more by lifestyle than by genetics. Monozygotic twins may not have the same CRP level; within each twin pair, the one with higher adiposity generally has a higher CRP level than the one with low adiposity. Chronic diseases generally have a lower prevalence among Asians than among Westerners. Asians also have lower CRP levels than Westerners. In large population studies, the median CRP level of Asians is only one-tenth that of Westerners. Is there a factor in the lifestyle or diet of Asians that accounts for lower CRP levels? For example, a statin inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis occurs in red yeast rice, an important component of the Asian diet. In summary, CRP is a marker for monitoring cardiovascular therapy and assessing the wellness of the general population. Through improving health and preventing disease, CRP testing may help lower a nation's health costs. © 2006 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.

33745887210	Ionic effect on the binding of bilirubin to the imprinted poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate)	A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) capable of detecting bilirubin was successfully synthesized. Bilirubin template was imprinted in poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate) [poly(MAA-co-EGDMA)]. MAA and EGDMA were used as the monomer and the cross-linker, respectively. The optimal solvent conditions to maintain its stability were discussed. Solvent system based on ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ascorbic acid was compared with respect to the stability of bilirubin. pH and bilirubin concentration were both investigated for the bilirubin stability. Blue light as well as aeration was applied to inspect the regarding effects. The cross-linking effect was further confirmed by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of salts, such as NaCl and KCl on the binding capacity of the molecularly imprinted polymer was also discussed. Further, the rat serum and bile samples were applied and the binding of the MIPs for bilirubin was thus confirmed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33750295420	Serum total antioxidant capacity reflects severity of illness in patients with severe sepsis	Introduction: We conducted the present study to evaluate the changes in serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in patients with severe sepsis and to investigate the association between serum TAC and clinical severity. Method: This was a prospective observational study involving asample of patients who met established criteria for severe sepsis and were admitted to the emergency department of a university teaching hospital. Serum TAC was determined using the total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter method. The levels of TAC, uric acid, albumin, and bilirubin in sera were obtained in the emergency department and evaluated to determine whether there were any correlations between the major antioxidant biomarkers and clinical severity of sepsis. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was used for clinical evaluation of the severity of sepsis. Results: A total of 73 patients with sepsis, with a mean (± standard deviation) APACHE II score of 23.2 ± 8.2 and a mortality rate of 26.0%, were included. Seventy-six healthy individuals served as control individuals. Among the patients, serum TAC levels correlated significantly with APACHE II scores. Patients who died also had higher TAC than did those who survived. Serum uric acid levels correlated significantly with serum TAC and APACHE II scores in patients with severe sepsis. Conclusion: Elevated serum TAC level may reflect clinical severity of sepsis. In addition, serum uric acid levels appear to contribute importantly to the higher TAC levels observed in patients with severe sepsis. © 2006 Chuang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0033198553	The effects of bile duct obstruction on the biliary secretion of ciprofloxacin in piglets	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of bile duct obstruction on biliary secretion of ciprofloxacin and to look for useful parameters to guide clinical use of antibiotics in patients with acute cholangitis. METHODS: Twenty-five Landrace piglets were used in this study. Their common bile ducts were ligated, with a duration ranging from 1 to 7 days. The changes of liver biochemical tests, intrabiliary pressure, diameter of common bile duct, and concentration of ciprofloxacin in bile were compared among the piglets with different severity of bile duct obstruction. RESULTS: The bile-to-serum ratio of the ciprofloxacin concentration was 586.4% ± 140.3% before the ligation of bile duct and was reduced significantly to 94.5% ± 118.0% after 1-day obstruction. The biliary secretion of ciprofloxacin was greatly affected by the intrabiliary pressure in that the bile-to-serum ratio of ciprofloxacin concentration was reduced to 12.2% ± 14.8% when the intrabiliary pressure reached to 32 cm H

0032896226	Biliary sludge and pigment stone formation in bile duct-ligated guinea pigs	We studied the effects of bile stasis in a guinea pig model of pigment gallstone. The common bile ducts of guinea pigs were partially ligated, and the guinea pigs killed one or two weeks later. Biliary sludge or stones were examined with the Fourier transform infrared: spectroscopy and the scanning electromicroscopy. The bile was analyzed for pH, free calcium, bile acids and bilirubin fractions, and the activities of both bacterial and endogenous β- glucuronidase. After bile duct ligation, calcium bilirubinate precipitates or stones formed in all except one of the animals studied. The bile pH and the proportion of unconjugated bilirubin rose after bile duct ligation, with a concomitant fall of bilirubin monoglucuronide. The activity of bacterial β- glucuronidase decreased after ligation, while the activity of endogenous β- glucuronidase rose at week 2. Our results imply that precipitation of calcium bilirubinate in this animal model was induced by an increased bile pH and the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated bilirubin.

0032957394	Enhanced dissolution of gallstone by combining ethanol with two commonly used cholelitholytic solvents	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Contact dissolution therapy is one of the non-surgical treatments for patients with gallstone. Among the various solvents, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is used for cholesterol gallstone, while tetrasodium ethyl-dimethyl tetraacetate (EDTA-4Na) solution is used to dissolve calcium bilirubinate stones. However, the contents of gallstone cannot be precisely predicted while they are still present in the human body. This study was designed to test if the MTBE and EDTA can be mixed together and to test the solubility of different kinds of gallstone in each original solution and mixture. METHODOLOGY: Each 0.1 gm of mixed cholesterol stone, brown stone and pigment stone from 18 patients was used. Pure ethanol was chosen to enhance the miscibility between the organic phase of MTBE and the aqueous phase of EDTA. The contents of gallstone after dissolution were examined with scanning electromicroscopy. RESULTS: We found the mixture of ethanol, MTBE and EDTA to be the most efficient solvent in gallstone dissolution in comparison with the other two original solvents. The mixture reached a dissolution percentage of 97.96 ± 1.00, 88.96 ± 6.51 and 67.75 ± 14.26 for cholesterol, brown and black pigment gallstone, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that ethanol can be used to mix the MTBE and EDTA with good preservation in their litholytic effects on gallstone. The ethanol-MTBE-EDTA solvent is, therefore, a promising universal cholelitholytic agent which deserves further tests for its safety and efficacy in the in vivo study.

0034112266	Serologic response to lower-molecular-weight proteins of H. pylori is related to clinical outcome of H. pylori infection in Taiwan	The study aimed to examine the serum serological response among H. pylori-infected patients with various upper gastrointestinal diagnoses; to ascertain whether it could be predictive to the diagnostic outcome of dyspepsia. One hundred seventy H. pylori-infected patients with dyspeptic symptoms but without previous treatment were enrolled, including those with duodenal ulcer disease (N = 47), gastric ulcer (N = 23), nonulcer dyspepsia (N = 60), gastric cancer (N = 34), and MALToma (N = 6). Sera from dyspeptic patients without H. pylori infection (N = 33) were used as controls. During endoscopy, gastric biopsies were taken for CLO-test, histology, and culture for the detection of H. pylori infection, defined by a positive culture or positive results of both CLO-test and histology. Total H. pylori IgG antibody was tested by an ELISA method. Antibody responses to specific H. pylori proteins were tested by a western blotting system. Of patients with H. pylori-infected gastroduodenal diseases, 76.5%, 42.9%, 23.6%, 46.7%, 84.1%, 76.5%, 82.9%, and 32.4% on average, showed responses to the 116-kDa (CagA), 89-kDa (VacA), 60-kDa, 45-kDa, 35-kDa, 30-kDa, 26.5-kDa, and 19.5-kDa H. pylori-specific proteins, respectively. A significant association was found between the serological response to 19.5-kDa and 26.5-kDa proteins and malignant outcome. Of H. pylori infection (P < 0.02). Among patients without malignancy, the absence of a band at 19.5 kDa was statistically associated with the presence of an ulcer (P < 0.05). The presence of serum antibody against CagA is not different between patients with ulcer and with malignancy in clinical diagnosis. The serum test for detecting antibodies against lower- molecular-weight proteins of H. pylori, such as those of 19.5 and 26.5 kDa, could be useful to identify H. pylori-infected patients at risk of peptic ulcer or malignancy.

0033783715	Human biliary β-glucuronidase activity before and after relief of bile duct obstruction: Is it the major role in the formation of pigment gallstones?	Background and Aims: The bacterial β-glucuronidase (bBG) can deconjugate conjugated bilirubin to form calcium bilirubinate gallstone. Yet, the role of the human biliary β-glucuronidase (hBG) in the pathogenesis of pigment gallstone formation still remains unsolved. Methods: Hepatic bile was collected from bile-duct-obstructed patients on the day of, and 3 days after, biliary drainage. Patients were divided into pigment-stone (PS) group (n = 34) and stone-free (SF) group (n = 29). All patients of the PS group had the complication of cholangitis. The concentrations of bile contents and the activities of bBG and hBG were measured. Results: The activities of hBG and bBG in bile obtained on the day of biliary drainage were higher in the PS group than in the SF group (activities corrected for bile salt concentration: hBG 128.7 ± 340.0 vs 13.1 ± 25.0 U/mmol; bBG 12.5 ± 22.2 vs 4.6 ± 7.7 U/mmol, P<0.05). This difference disappeared after biliary drainage. The changes of enzyme activity in the bile of the SF group were unremarkable before and after biliary drainage. The mean concentrations of bile pigments and free calcium in the PS group were lower than those in the SF group. Conclusions: An increase in the activity of hBG may be a secondary response, developed after bile duct inflammation because it was elevated only when the bile duct obstruction was associated with infection.

0033839763	Melatonin prevents pigment gallstone formation induced by bile duct ligation in guinea pigs	Free radical-mediated oxidative stress has been implicated in the genesis of gallstone in vitro. This study was designed to examine the oxidative stress changes during pigment gallstone formation and to investigate whether melatonin (MLT) could act as a chemopreventive agent for cholelithiasis in a guinea pig model. The common bile duct of guinea pigs was ligated with or without MLT pretreatment. Animals were studied on day 7, 9, 12, and 14 after surgery. Stone and/or sludge developed in ligated guinea pigs without MLT. Fourier transform infrared spectra of the sludge showed the presence of calcium bilirubinate, whose peak height per milligram of sludge gradually increased with time after ligation. Total antioxidant activity (TAA) in bile of guinea pigs at day 14 after ligation reduced to one third of the level in sham-operated controls (P < .001). In addition, the bile of ligated guinea pigs had increased pH (P < .001), bile salts (P < .01), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (P < .05), compared to sham controls. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with MLT at a dose of 1,000 μg/kg significantly decreased the incidence of pigment gallstone formation at day 14 after ligation, as compared to no pretreatment (0/7 vs. 8/10). MLT also reverted the ligation-induced changes in biliary bile salts, pH, MDA, and TAA to control levels. These in vivo findings support a causative role of oxidative stress in the bile duct ligation-induced pigment gallstone formation. Antioxidants may prove useful in preventing pigment gallstone formation in humans.

0033966318	Application of nonionic surfactants combining hydrophobic and hydrophilic cholelitholytic solvents on dissolution of gallstones	Application of nonionic surfactants in chemolitholysis was developed to combine two immiscible cholelitholytic solvents, MTBE and EDTA, into a homogeneous solution to increase the efficiency of gallstone dissolution. Eight kinds of Sinopol were employed to investigate and prepare the homogeneous solution, which included MTBE, EDTA (2wt.%) aqueous solution and the Sinopol, thereby, an in vitro study of chemolitholysis was carried out. Three kinds of gallstones were characterized by FTIR and SEM. The dissolution percentage of three kinds of gallstones in the homogeneous (Sinopol mixed) solution was evaluated and a comparison of the average dissolution percentage between these Sinopol mixed solutions and traditional cholelitholytic solvents was made. The composition of gallstones was classified into oil-soluble and water-soluble groups. Furthermore, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of solvents corresponding to oil-soluble and water-soluble gallstone components were analysed and discussed with a phase diagram.

39649094498	Diagnostic role of biliary pancreatic elastase for cholangiocarcinoma in patients with cholestasis	Background: A wide array of proteins is secreted into the bile and may be associated with biliary tract diseases. We attempted to discover novel biomarker in bile for cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: Bile was collected from patients with bile duct obstruction. Proteins were separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry. Levels of mRNA and protein expression of the candidate biomarker were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively, whereas enzyme activity was measured by a kinetic method. The diagnostic efficacy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Pancreatic elastase (PE) 3B was identified as a biomarker for cholangiocarcinoma. The mRNA of PE 3B was up-regulated in cancerous tissues, compared to non-cancerous tissues. The protein expression and enzyme activity of PE in bile were increased in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, compared to gallstone patients. Biliary amylase activity was used to correct the presence of pancreaticobiliary reflux. Significantly higher PE/amylase ratios in bile were found in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (0.214 ± 0.045) than those with gallstone (0.023 ± 0.005, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve of the ratio was 0.877 (95% CI: 0.765 to 0.988). Using 0.065 as a cutoff value, the ratio distinguished malignant from benign causes of biliary obstruction with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 89%. Conclusion: PE in bile is a biomarker for cholangiocarcinoma and the combination measurement of PE and amylase enhances diagnostic efficacy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0034941321	Expression of oncogene products HER2/Neu and RAS and fibrosis-related growth factors bFGF, TGF-β, and PDGF in bile from biliary malignancies and inflammatory disorders	The expression of several growth factors and K-ras gene mutation in bile were studied to better understand the pathogenesis and improve early diagnosis of bile duct cancers. Bile samples were collected from 12 cholangiocarcinomas (CLC), 10 ampullary cancers (APC), 3 gallbladder cancers (GBC), 7 pancreatic cancers (PNC), 9 biliary tract infection (BTI), 8 biliary stone disease (ST), and 5 normal controls (NC). The highest mean value of TGF-β in bile was in patients with BTI; the mean levels of bFGF and PDGF were highest in CLC, and patients with APC and CLC had higher expression of HER2/Neu than other groups. In bile, a K-ras gene codon 12 mutation was found in 5 of 6 (83%) cases of CLC by the PCR-RFLP method. The results suggest overexpression of bFGF, PDGF, and HER2/Neu and the presence of K-ras mutation are important for carcinogenesis of bile duct cancers, and detection of the above abnormalities in bile is helpful for early diagnosis.

77954347658	A magnetic-bead based microfluidic system for automatic C-reactive protein detection	C-reactive protein (CRP) has been used as a common indicator during inflammation process. It has been also reported that CRP concentration in serum can be used for risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, a new microfluidic system for automatic measurement of CRP is developed. When compared to our previous work, the new chip can perform the entire measurement process by integrating a new micro-injector with other functional microfluidic devices. Experimental data show that the developed system can automate the entire process within 35 minutes with a high sensitivity. The development of the new system may provide a promising platform for automatic measurement of the CRP for point-of-care applications. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.

84877809829	Carbon monoxide may enhance bile secretion by increasing glutathione excretion and Mrp2 expression in rats	Background: Nitric oxide (NO) donors have been reported to induce choleresis via an increased excretion of glutathione. The effects of another gas molecule, carbon monoxide (CO), on bile formation are, however, inconsistent among previous reports. We investigated the sequential changes of bile output and the biliary contents in rats with or without CO supplementation to elucidate the mechanism of CO on bile excretion. Methods: Dichloromethane (DCM) was gastrically fed to male Sprague-Dawley rats to yield CO by liver biotransformation. The rats were divided into DCM-treated (n = 7), DCM plus L-NAME-treated (n = 6), and corn oil-treated-(n = 8) groups. Bile samples were collected hourly to examine the flow rate and bile content. Serum levels of nitrite and nitrate 4 hours after DCM supplementation with or without NO synthase (NOS) inhibition were measured by capillary electrophoresis. The expression of hepatic inducible NOS was evaluated by Western blotting 6 hours after DCM administration. Results: Levels of carboxyhemoglobin rose to around 10% at 4 hours after DCM supplementation and were maintained until the end of the experiments. Bile flow increased after DCM supplementation and was associated with a concomitant increase of biliary glutathione and higher hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) expression. Hepatic inducible NOS expression and serum nitrate/nitrite levels were also increased. Treatment with an NOS inhibitor (L-NAME) abolished the CO-induced glutathione excretion and choleresis, but not Mrp2 expression. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that CO enhanced biliary output in conjunction with NO by increasing the biliary excretion of glutathione. The increment in biliary glutathione was associated with an increased expression of hepatic Mrp2. © 2013 .

48749124234	Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B cleaves human S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and induces hypermethioninemia	Group A Streptococcus is a common pathogen that causes pharyngitis, impetigo, myositis, and lethal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B) is strongly associated with the severity of disease. SPE B is a cysteine protease and matures itself by autocatalysis. We found that SPE B was directly associated with human S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase), an essential factor for a delayed-type immune response. AdoHcyase protein levels and enzymatic activities were significantly higher in human cells infected with the Streptococcus pyogenes SW510 speB mutant strain than in cells infected with the NZ131 wild-type strain. SPE B also inactivated AdoHcyase, shown by a decrease in homocysteine, the main product of AdoHcyase. We found that in vivo and in vitro, SPE B induced hypermethioninemia, which is caused by an AdoHcyase defect. We also found that AdoHcyase is a substrate of SPE B cysteine protease. SPE B, therefore, potentially causes immunosuppression by cleaving AdoHcyase. © 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

67349251480	An integrated microfluidic system for C-reactive protein measurement	This study presents a new microfluidic chip integrated with pneumatic micropumps, normally close microvalves and vortex-type micromixers for C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement. CRP is a protein produced during the inflammation process. It has been reported that CRP in serum can be used for risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, CRP measurements were performed by using the integrated microfluidic chip incorporated with magnetic beads. The magnetic beads coated with CRP-specific DNA aptamers were used to recognize, purify and enrich the target CRP. The entire process including sample pre-treatment, and the interaction between the target CRP and anti-CRP antibody was automatically performed on a single chip. The chemiluminescence signal was measured using a luminometer to detect the concentration of CRP afterwards. The entire reaction time is less then 25 min, which is only about 20% of the time required when compared to using traditional bench-top machines (150 min). More importantly, the detection limit has been improved from 0.125 to 0.0125 mg/L with only half the amount of reagent consumption. The development of this microfluidic system is promising for fast, accurate, and sensitive detection of CRP. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

69549124156	High oxidative stress is correlated with frailty in elderly Chinese	Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between oxidative stress and frailty in elderly people. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Community and hospital-based outpatient clinic. Participants: Ninety participants aged 65 and older. Measurements: Frailty status was determined according to the presence of weak handgrip strength, weight loss, slow walking speed, exhaustion, and low activity level and was classified as frail (≥3 criteria), prefrail (1 or 2 criteria), or robust (0 criteria). An oxidative stress marker (serum 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG), metabolic markers (body mass index, waist-hip ratio, serum lipids, glucose, and albumin), an inflammatory marker (serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, hs-CRP), demographic information, and comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, overweight or obesity, impaired fasting plasma glucose, renal insufficiency, and depression) were assessed. Results: Of the 90 participants, 21 (23.3%) were frail, 56 (62.2%) were prefrail, and 13 (14.4%) were robust. Frail subjects had higher median (range) serum 8-OHdG (2.5 ng/mL (1.5-6.2 ng/mL) vs 2.3 ng/mL (0.5-8.1 ng/mL) and 1.0 ng/mL (0.5-5.3 ng/mL)) and serum hs-CRP (2.5 mg/L (0.3-32.1 mg/L) vs 1.8 mg/L (0.3-50.5 mg/L) and 1.7 mg/L (0.3-4.0 mg/L)) levels, lower mean±standard deviation serum albumin levels (4.1±0.4 g/dL vs 4.4±0.4 g/dL and 4.6±0.2 g/dL) and higher mean waist-hip ratios (0.96±0.11 vs 0.91±0.07 and 0.89±0.05)) than prefrail and robust subjects, respectively (P<.05 for all). In multivariable regression analysis, high serum 8-OHdG level was still significantly associated with frailty after adjusting for age, smoking status, comorbidities, waist-hip ratio, serum albumin level, and hs-CRP level. Conclusion: High oxidative stress, characterized by high serum 8-OHdG level, was independently associated with frailty in the selected sample of elderly Chinese. © 2009, The American Geriatrics Society.

0035032291	Protective effect of melatonin on renal injury of rats induced by bile duct ligation	Oxygen radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal injury induced by extrahepatic cholestasis. We conduct this study to investigate whether melatonin can have a protective effect against such injury. Either normal saline or gentamicin with or without melatonin was injected into rats that received either a bile duct ligation or a sham operation. The serum levels of malondialdehyde and total antioxidative activity were measured. The kidney was fixed for histologic scoring of renal injury. The serum malondialdehyde level was highest in the rats that received both bile duct ligation and gentamicin injection. Treatment with melatonin significantly increased the serum total antioxidative activity and reduced the serum malondialdehyde concentration. The mean score of renal injury, highest in the rats receiving bile duct ligation and gentamicin injection, was significantly reduced with melatonin treatment. By reducing the systemic oxygen radicals, supplementation with antioxidants exerts a protective effect on the renal injury induced by extrahepatic cholestasis.

77952294160	Integrated microfluidic system for rapid screening of CRP aptamers utilizing systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)	The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an experimental procedure that allows screening of given molecular targets by desired binding affinities from an initial random pool of oligonucleotides and oligomers. The final products of SELEX are usually referred as aptamers, which are recognized as promising molecules for a variety of biomedical applications. However, SELEX is an iterative process requiring multiple rounds of extraction and amplification that demands significant time and labor. Therefore, this study presents a novel, automatic, miniature SELEX platform. As a demonstration, the rapid screening of C-reactive protein (CRP) aptamers was performed. By utilizing microfluidic technologies and magnetic beads conjugated with CRP, aptamers with a high affinity to CRP were extracted from a random single-strand deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) pool. These aptamers were further amplified by an on-chip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. After five consecutive extraction and amplification cycles, a specific aptamer with the highest affinity was screened automatically. The screened aptamers were used as a recognition molecule for the detection of CRP. The developed microsystem demonstrated fast screening of CRP aptamers and can be used as a powerful tool to select analyte-specific aptamers for biomedical applications. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

78649527705	Low serum testosterone and frailty in older men and women	Background: Frail older persons are at high risk of morbidity and mortality, and are characterized by body composition alterations. Serum testosterone, which regulates body composition, declines with age. We investigated the relation between serum testosterone level and physiological frailty in both older men and women. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 108 adults 65 years old or older. Frailty status was determined by hand-grip strength, weight change, walking speed, exhaustion, and activity levels, and was classified as frail (3 or more deficits), pre-frail (1 or 2 deficits), or robust (no deficit) according to the Fried criteria. Serum total testosterone (TT) and sex-hormone-binding globulin were measured while free testosterone (FT) was estimated. Results: Median (range) TT and FT were lower in frail than in pre-frail and robust men (TT: (frail) 15.7 [2.4-26.9] vs. (pre-frail) 19.4 [7.2-39.9] and (robust) 25.9 [13.2-35.2] nmol/L, P = 0.03; FT: 230.0 [35.9-299.0] vs. 272.0 [86.7-411.0] and 303.0 [267.0-396.0] pmol/L, P = 0.02) and women (TT: 0.31 [0.10-0.51] vs. 0.47 [0.14-1.55] and 0.45 [0.36-1.25] nmol/L, P = 0.02; FT: 4.59 [0.46-6.63] vs. 4.66 [1.57-15.10] and 6.65 [3.91-21.00] pmol/L, P = 0.03). After adjusting for age, comorbidities, body mass index, and serum albumin in ordinal logistic regression model, odds ratios of being frail were significantly higher for those participants whose TT and FT levels were in the lowest tertile compared to the highest tertile in men (TT: odds ratio [OR] 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-9.50; FT: OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.05-11.22) and in women (TT: OR 6.69, 95% CI 1.84-24.31; FT: OR 4.86, 95% CI 1.31-18.08).

78650907102	High resolution melting analysis for the detection of SLC25A13 gene mutations in Taiwan	Background: Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13 gene, is a mitochondrial solute transporter with a crucial role in urea, nucleotide and protein synthesis. SLC25A13 mutations cause two phenotypes, adult-onset type II citrullinemia and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). This study aimed to develop a high resolution melting (HRM) analysis for SLC25A13 mutation scanning and determine the carrier rate in Taiwan. Methods: DNAs from healthy subjects (n = 479), and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 100) and NICCD (n = 5) were scanned in exons 6, 9, 11, 16, and 17 and parts of introns of SLC25A13 using HRM analysis. All mutations detected by HRM analysis were further confirmed by TaqMan method and/or direct sequencing. Results: In healthy subjects, seventeen carriers with mutants c.851_854del (n = 10), c.1638_1660dup, c.615. +. 5G > A (n = 4), and two novel mutants, c.475C > T and c.1658G > A, were detected. The frequency of carriers was about 1/28. In patients with HCC, there were only 2 carriers with c.851_854del mutant. Patients with NICCD (n = 5) diagnosed during 2007 and 2008, harbored compound heterozygous mutations c.851_854del/c.1177. +. 1G > A, c.851_854del/c.1638_1660dup (n = 2), c.851_854del/c.615. +. 5G > A, and c.1638_1660dup/c.615. +. 5G > A. Conclusions: HRM analysis is a simple, rapid and robust method for detecting SLC25A13 mutations in clinical laboratories. SLC25A13 mutations may not be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of HCC in Taiwan. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79953781053	An integrated microfluidic system for rapid screening of alpha-fetoprotein aptamers	Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a screening technique that involves a progressive selection of highly specific ligands by performing repeated rounds of partition and amplification from a large combinatorial nucleic acid library. The products of the selection are usually called aptamers, which are short single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) or ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) molecules binding with high affinity to a large variety of target analytes. However, SELEX is an iterative process requiring multiple rounds of extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification that demands significant sampling and process time. In order to address these problems, the study presents a new integrated microfluidic system consisting of an automatic SELEX chip and a competitive assay chip to enhance the aptamer screening efficiency. With this approach, an aptamer specific to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is a biomarker for liver cancer, has been successfully screened.

0036016641	The assessment of biliary CA 125, CA 19-9 and CEA in diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma - The influence of sampling time and hepatolithiasis	Background/Aims: This study was conducted to assess the clinical value of biliary CA 19-9, CA 125 and CEA sampled in different situations for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Methodology: Bile was obtained from patients with bile duct obstruction on the day of biliary drainage and 3 days later separately. The etiology of biliary obstruction included choledocholithiasis (N=51), hepatolithiasis (N=19) and cholangiocarcinoma (N=28). Patients of the former two conditions were all complicated with cholangitis. Results: The sensitivity of biliary CEA, CA 19-9 and CA 125, whenever checked were all less than 70%. The biliary CEA and CA 19-9 were elevated in the presence of cholangitis. In addition, the biliary CEA was also increased in the patients with hepatolithiasis. The specificity of CA 125 was better than those of CEA and CA 19-9 (75.7% vs. 33.3% and 60%, respectively) on the day of biliary drainage. The diagnostic efficiency was slightly improved when combining biliary CA 125 and CEA. Conclusions: As the biliary CA 125 was less affected by inflammation and hepatolithiasis, it is more useful than CEA and CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. The single tumor marker test of CA 125 or combined tumor marker test of CEA and CA 125 may be used as a useful complement to other investigative methods to differentiate benign from malignant causes of the bile duct obstruction.

0036194070	Total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde in acute abdominal pain	Recent investigations suggest that oxidative stress markers are useful in the evaluation of some types of abdominal pathology. We hypothesized that the severity of abdominal pain is correlated with oxidative stress as quantified by total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). The objective of this study was to determine the plasma TAG and MDA levels in patients with acute abdominal pain and to examine their relation to abdominal emergency. We recruited 128 patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the emergency department. Medical history, vital signs and laboratory data were collected on arrival. TAC and MDA levels were determined using serums obtained from the initial blood sampling. Patients with acute abdominal pain had lower levels of TAG and higher levels of MDA than normal control. When patients were grouped according to whether they were discharged early (less than 24 hours) or hospitalized longer than 24 hours, Patients with hospital stay > 24 hours had significantly elevated pulse rate, temperature, leukocyte count, and C reactive protein (GRP) and lower TAG. No significant difference was found in age, sex, temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and MDA level. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that CRP and TAC were significant indicators of quantitative variables for disposition. This study found a correlation exists between oxidative stress and disease severity in patients with abdominal pain. This suggests that TAC might be useful as a guide for patient disposition in the emergency department. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

79959637803	An integrated microfluidic system for fast, automatic detection of C-reactive protein	C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known inflammation marker in human beings. This study reports a new microfluidic system for fast, automatic detection of CRP. It contains pneumatic micropumps, a vortex-type micromixer, a pneumatic micro-injector and several microvalves to automatically perform the entire protocol for CRP detection. This includes sample/reagent transportation, incubation between the target CRP and a CRP-specific aptamer, washing processes, and the chemiluminescence development process. In addition, the chemiluminescence signal is measured by using a custom-made optical system which consists of a photomultiplier tube, a portable air compressor and eight electronic magnet valves to quantify the concentration of CRP. When compared to previous works, not only can this new microfluidic system automatically perform the entire process via a new integrated micro-injector and new micropumps, but a new CRP-specific DNA aptamer with a higher affinity and specificity is also used for CRP measurement. Experimental data show that the developed system can automatically complete the entire protocol within 30 min with a detection limit of 0.0125 mg/L, which is superior to previous published results. Moreover, this study also measures CRP concentration from clinical samples to verify the performance of the developed microfluidic system. The results indicate that the measured CRP concentrations from human serums are consistent with those using a benchtop system. The developed system can also detect CRP concentrations from human whole blood without any external sample pretreatment process. This microfluidic system may be promising for point-of-care applications for CRP detection in the future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80755171209	The value of serum ischemia-modified albumin for assessing liver function in patients with chronic liver disease	Background: Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), measured by the cobalt-binding capacity of albumin, is a promising biomarker for cardiac ischemia. The IMA-to-serum albumin ratio (IMAR) has been reported to relate to the severity of decompensated liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to assess IMA and IMAR as a liver function test and to investigate whether albumin infusion changes IMAR in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (n=51) and patients with chronic hepatitis (n=25), liver cirrhosis (n=24) and uremia (n=13). Parameters examined included serum levels of IMA, albumin, total bilirubin, creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, childturcotte-pugh (CTP) score, indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Paired serum samples from patients pre- and post-albumin infusion (n=9) were collected and the changes were compared. Results: IMA and IMAR increased in patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, as compared to healthy volunteers. In patients with liver disease, IMA and IMAR were significantly associated with ICG retention, bilirubin, TAC and INR. In addition, IMAR was associated with CTP and MELD score in patients with cirrhosis. Albumin therapy improved patients' serum levels of creatinine and bilirubin and MELD score, but not IMA and IMAR. Conclusions: IMAR, reflecting liver function and oxidative stress, is a more objective liver function test as it was not affected after a 3-day albumin infusion. More investigations, however, are needed to validate the use of IMAR in cases of chronic liver disease. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2011.

84860491099	Rapid measurement of AFP using AFP-specific aptamer on a microfluidic chip	This study presents a new suction-type microfluidic system capable of rapid measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) by utilizing magnetic bead-based technologies. Two modules, including a suction-type incubator for the magnetic beads to capture AFP and acridinium ester (AE)-labeled anti-AFP antibodies and a microfluidic control module for sample transportation, were integrated into this microfluidic system. With the incorporation of AFP-specific aptamer-conjugated magnetic beads, the target AFP could be recognized and attracted onto the surface of the magnetic beads from the clinical sample. The entire process including two-step incubation and purification process could be automatically performed within 25 min, which is only about 20% of the time required when using a benchtop machine (for about 130 min). Besides, the total sample and reagent volume consumed is only 105 μL, which is significantly less than that required in a large system (410 μL). More importantly, experimental results showed that clinical human serum samples can also be accurately analyzed. The microfluidic system may be promising for point-of-care applications for AFP detection in the future. © 2012 IEEE.

84862791532	An integrated microfluidic system for rapid screening of alpha-fetoprotein-specific aptamers	The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a screening technique that involves the progressive selection of highly specific ligands via repeated rounds of partition and amplification from a large random pool of nucleic acid sequences. The products of this selection process are called aptamers and are either short single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules with a high binding affinity to a large variety of target analytes. However, SELEX is a lengthy, labor-intensive, iterative process requiring multiple rounds of extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. In order to address these problems, this study presents a new integrated microfluidic system consisting of a magnetic bead-based microfluidic SELEX chip and a competitive assay chip to automate the aptamer screening process. More importantly, the selected ssDNA sequences were confirmed to have a high affinity and specificity to the target molecules, using the developed competitive assay chip. With this approach, an aptamer specific to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is a biomarker for liver cancers, has been successfully selected. The screened aptamer was used as a recognition molecule for AFP and has a linear detection range from 12.5 to 800. ng/mL, which was suitable for rapid clinical applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

0037237167	Clinical application of 20 MHz endosonography and anti-Helicobacter pylori immunoblots to predict regression of low-grade gastric MALtoma by H. pylori eradication	Aim. We tested whether serial 20 MHz endosonography (EUS) and anti-Helicobacter pylori immunoblots can predict the complete regression of gastric MALToma by H. pylori eradication. Methods. The serums of 17 MALToma patients, including 15 with low grade and two with high grade, were collected before therapy. Fifteen patients with low-grade MALToma and 18 nonMALToma patients, all infected with H. pylori, have been followed with serum sampling, endoscopy, and EUS on enrollment, on the 2nd, 6th, and 12th months after anti-H. pylori therapy. All sera were tested for anti-H. pylori immunoblots, including 19.5, 26.5, 30, 35, 89, 116 KDa (CagA), FldA. The DNAs were extracted serially from the biopsy of MALToma patients before and after therapy to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene monoclonality. Results. MALToma patients had higher prevalence rates of anti-FldA protein, 19.5 and 30 KDa antibodies of H. pylori (p < 0.01). After H. pylori eradication, MALToma patients had negative seroconversion of 19.5, 26.5, 30, and 35 KDa antibodies (p < 0.05), but not in CagA and FldA. The PCR monoclonality occurred in 80% (12/15) of the MALToma patients before therapy, but did not correlate with any seroconversion of anti-H. pylori immunoblots after therapy (p > 0.05). Complete regression of MALToma was observed in 73.3% (11/15) of patients. Evaluation with 20 MHz EUS, for the initial tumor depth and its normalization on the 6th month had 90.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity to predict the complete regression. Discussion. The negative seroconversions of the smaller-molecular-weight proteins, but not CagA and FldA, correlate with regression of MALToma by H. pylori eradication. 20 MHz EUS can effectively predict the therapeutic response of MALToma.

0037663719	The value of biliary fibronectin for diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma	Background/Aims: The fibronectin in various body fluids was reported to be useful in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant diseases. We conducted this study to assess the diagnostic value of biliary fibronectin. Methodology: Bile was collected from patients with gallstones (n=62), benign biliary stricture (n=5) and cholangiocarcinoma (n=28). All patients with gallstones were complicated with cholangitis. The absolute biliary level of fibronectin was determined by an immunoenzymatric assay and divided by the biliary concentration of bile acids to calculate the relative concentration. Results: The relative concentration of biliary fibronectin was significantly different among the patients with benign biliary obstruction, gallstone and cholangiocarcinoma (7.1±14.3 vs. 350.5±1535.4 vs. 180592.6±917236.2, p<0.05). With a cut-off value of 40ng/μmol, its sensitivity for diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma was 0.57, and specificity, 0.79. Conclusions: As bile may be concentrated or diluted to a various extent after biliary obstruction, the relative concentration of biliary fibronectin is more useful than the absolute concentration in differentiating the causes of biliary obstruction. In addition to the presence of biliary cancer, biliary fibronectin was also increased in response to biliary inflammation, which limits its use as a tumor marker of cholangiocarcinoma.

84871809253	An automatic microfluidic system that continuously performs the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment	The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique has been extensively used to screen molecule-specific aptamers from combinatorial libraries of synthetic nucleic acids. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA, which have a high affinity to a large variety of molecules ranging from small drugs or metabolites to cells. Therefore, they have a variety of promising applications such as for diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this study, a new microfluidic chip was developed to perform continuous screening of DNA-based aptamers in an automatic format. When compared with the existing manual procedure, the developed microfluidic chip has several advantages including a rapid and efficient screening process, automation, and less consumption of samples/reagents. Experimental data showed that an aptamer specific to alpha-fetoprotein was successfully screened from a random DNA pool. The entire screening process (five continuous, repetitive rounds) can be completed within 6 h, which is much faster than the traditional methods (more than 15 h). An automatic, rapid and efficient SELEX process was performed by this developed microfluidic chip, which may enable a generalized platform for the fast screening of DNA-based biomarkers in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84875371089	Increased aortic stiffness and attenuated lysyl oxidase activity in obesity	OBJECTIVE: One potential mechanism through which obesity exerts adverse effects on the vascular system is by increasing aortic stiffness, a change known to be predictive of increased cardiovascular mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology that links obesity to aortic stiffening. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Obese (ob/ob) mice were used to examine physical, morphological, and molecular changes in the aorta in response to obesity. ob/ob mice had increased aortic pulse wave velocity and tissue rigidity. ob/ob aorta exhibited decreases of lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity and cross-linked elastin, and increases of elastin fragmentation and elastolytic activity. The aortas of ob/ob mice were surrounded by a significant amount of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative perivascular adipose tissue. In vitro studies revealed that the conditioned medium from differentiated adipocytes or the perivascular adipose tissue of ob/ob mice attenuated LOX activity. Furthermore, inhibition of LOX in wild-type lean mice caused elastin fragmentation and induced a significant increase in pulse wave velocity. Finally, we found that obese humans had stiffer arteries and lower serum LOX levels than do normal-weight humans. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that obesity resulted in aortic stiffening in both humans and mice, and established a causal relationship between LOX downregulation and aortic stiffening in obesity. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84877619059	Glycine ameliorates liver injury and vitamin D deficiency induced by bile duct ligation	Background: Patients with chronic liver disease had lower serum concentrations 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). Glycine, a nonessential amino acid, exerts anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and immunomodulatory properties. This study aimed to establish a tandem mass spectrometry assay to measure 25OHD in guinea pigs serum and to investigate the effects of glycine against the liver damage induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Methods: BDL was performed on male guinea pigs. Glycine, alanine, serine or tyrosine was given by intraperitoneal injection. The animals were sacrificed and examined at 7 and 14. days after BDL. Serum concentrations of total bilirubin and aminotransferase were measured. Serum concentrations of 25OHD2 and 25OHD3 were measured by API 5000 mass spectrometer. In addition, oxidative stress was assessed by serum ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), and apoptosis by hepatic caspase 3 activities. Results: Serum 25OHD concentrations were decreased around 50% in the BDL group at days 7 and 14 post ligation, compared to sham (mean 65.3. ng/ml, p<0.005). Glycine but not other amino acid treatment blunted the reduced serum 25OHD (52.6. ng/ml, p<0.05) resulting from BDL. The concentrations of 25OHD were negatively associated with concentrations of IMA (r =0.305, p<0.05) and caspase 3 (r =0.562, p<0.0001). At day-14 post ligation, glycine treatment also ameliorated liver damage indicated by serum AST (p<0.005), ALT (p<0.05) and hepatic caspase 3 activities (p<0.05) and oxidative stress. Conclusion: Our results indicate that glycine may protect against BDL-induced liver injury through attenuation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and the vitamin D deficiency. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84878618830	An automatic microfluidic system for rapid screening of cancer stem-like cell-specific aptamers	This study reports a microfluidic system which automatically performs the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process for rapid screening of aptamers which are specific to cancer stem-like cells. The system utilizes magnetic bead-based techniques to select DNA aptamers and has several advantages including a rapid, automated screening process, and less consumption of cells and reagents. By integrating a microfluidic control module, a magnetic bead-based aptamer extraction module, and a temperature control module, the entire Cell-SELEX process can be performed in a shorter period of time. Compared with the traditional Cell-SELEX process, this microfluidic system is more efficient and consumes fewer sample volumes. It only takes approximately 3 days for an entire Cell-SELEX process with 15 screening runs, which is relatively faster than that of a traditional Cell-SELEX process (1 week for 15 rounds). The binding affinity of this resulting specific aptamer was measured by a flow cytometric analysis to have a dissociation constant (K

84882250533	The Asian project for collaborative derivation of reference intervals: (1) strategy and major results of standardized analytes	Background: A multicenter study conducted in Southeast Asia to derive reference intervals (RIs) for 72 commonly measured analytes (general chemistry, inflammatory markers, hormones, etc.) featured centralized measurement to clearly detect regionality in test results. The results of 31 standardized analytes are reported, with the remaining analytes presented in the next report. Method: The study included 63 clinical laboratories from South Korea, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and seven areas in Japan. A total of 3541 healthy individuals aged 20-65 years (Japan 2082, others 1459) were recruited mostly from hospital workers using a well-defined common protocol. All serum specimens were transported to Tokyo at -80 C and collectively measured using reagents from four manufacturers. Three-level nested ANOVA was used to quantitate variation (SD) of test results due to region, sex, and age. A ratio of SD for a given factor over residual SD (representing net between-individual variations) (SDR) exceeding 0.3 was considered significant. Traceability of RIs was ensured by recalibration using value-assigned reference materials. RIs were derived parametrically. Results: SDRs for sex and age were significant for 19 and 16 analytes, respectively. Regional difference was significant for 11 analytes, including high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and inflammatory markers. However, when the data were limited to those from Japan, regionality was not observed in any of the analytes. Accordingly, RIs were derived with or without partition by sex and region. Conclusions: RIs applicable to a wide area in Asia were established for the majority of analytes with traceability to reference measuring systems, whereas regional partitioning was required for RIs of the other analytes. © 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2013.

84907355121	An integrated microfluidic system for rapid HbA1c measurement	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent diseases and easily lead to serious complications. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), an emerging biomarker for reliable monitoring of DM is commonly detected by bench-top immunoassays, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. As an advance to existing methods, a microfluidic platform capable of performing automated immunoassay for HbA1c detection within 25 minutes is presented in this work. The microfluidic assay was able to detect HbA1c from human whole blood samples and delivered similar performance as its bench-top counterpart. The developed microfluidic chip is therefore promising for rapid detection of HbA1c for monitoring DM. Copyright © (2013) by the Chemical and Biological Microsystems Society All rights reserved.

84908654118	Measurement of glycated hemoglobin using an aptamer/antibody assay on an integrated microfluidic system	Measurement of the ratio between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and total hemoglobin (Hb) is now recommended for screening and diagnosing diabetes, in addition to monitoring long-term glycemic control for patient management. The costly and time-consuming traditional assay methods, which involve multi-step, bench-top, and antibody-based immunoassays, have presented major challenges to their clinical utility. In this study, an integrated microfluidic system capable of rapidly measuring the level of HbA1c and Hb in an automated fashion was reported. Moreover, this detection assay used nucleic acid aptamers that exhibited high sensitivity and specificity to Hb and HbA1c to further enhance the robustness of the assay. Combining the advantages of microfluidics and aptamers, this system presents a promising tool for clinical diagnosis and management of diabetes. As a demonstration of its clinical utility, we analyzed patient whole blood samples with clinically-relevant concentrations of HbA1c and Hb (4.4%-12.5% and 12.1 g/dL-14.9 g/dL, respectively) on our integrated microfluidic system.
