14844340570	Up-regulation of intestinal nuclear factor kappa B and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 following traumatic brain injury in rats	Aim: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) regulates a large number of genes involved in the inflammatory response to critical illnesses, but it is not known if and how NF-κB is activated and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressed in the gut following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of current study was to investigate the temporal pattern of intestinal NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression following TBI. Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (6 rats in each group) including controls with sham operation and TBI groups at hours 3, 12, 24, and 72, and on d 7. Parietal brain contusion was adopted using weight-dropping method. All rats were decapitated at corresponding time point and mid-jejunum samples were taken. NF-κB binding activity in jejunal tissue was measured using EMSA. Immunohistochemistry was used for detection of ICAM-1 expression in jejunal samples. Results: There was a very low NF-κB binding activity and little ICAM-1 expression in the gut of control rats after sham surgery. NF-κB binding activity in jejunum significantly increased by 160% at 3 h following TBI (P<0.05 vs control), peaked at 72 h (500% increase) and remained elevated on d 7 post-injury by 390% increase. Compared to controls, ICAM-1 was significantly up-regulated on the endothelia of microvessels in villous interstitium and lamina propria by 24 h following TBI and maximally expressed at 72 h post-injury (P<0.001). The endothelial ICAM-1 immunoreactivity in jejunal mucosa still remained strong on d 7 post-injury. The peak of NF-κB activation and endothelial ICAM-1 expression coincided in time with the period during which secondary mucosal injury of the gut was also at their culmination following TBI. Conclusion: TBI could induce an immediate and persistent up-regulation of NF-κB activity and subsequent up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression in the intestine. Inflammatory response mediated by increased NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute gut mucosal injury following TBI. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

1842483041	Levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin and calcitonin gene-related peptide in plasma and jejunum of rats following traumatic brain injury and underlying significance in gastrointestinal dysfunction	Aim: To study the alterations of brain-gut peptides following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to explore the underlying significance of these peptides in the complicated gastrointestinal dysfunction. Methods: Rat models of focal traumatic brain injury were established by impact insult method, and divided into 6 groups (6 rats each group) including control group with sham operation and TBI groups at postinjury 3, 12, 24, 72 h, and d 7. Blood and proximal jejunum samples were taken at time point of each group and gross observations of gastrointestinal pathology were recorded simultaneously. The levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in plasma, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and cholecystokinin (CCK) in both plasma and jejunum were measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to determine the levels of VIP in jejunum. Results: Gastric distension, delayed gastric emptying and intestinal dilatation with a large amount of yellowish effusion and thin edematous wall were found in TBI rats through 12 h and 72 h, which peaked at postinjury 72 h. As compared with that of control group (247.8±29.5 ng/L), plasma VIP levels were significantly decreased at postinjury 3, 12 and 24 h (106.7±34.1 ng/L, 148.7±22.8 ng/L, 132.8±21.6 ng/L, respectively), but significantly increased at 72 h (405.0±29.8 ng/Q and markedly declined on d 7 (130.7±19.3 ng/L). However, Plasma levels CCK and CGRP were significantly increased through 3 h and 7 d following TBI (126-691% increases), with the peak at 72 h. Compared with control (VIP, 13.6±1.4 ng/g; CGRP, 70.6±17.7 ng/g); VIP and CGRP levels in jejunum were significantly increased at 3 h after TBI (VIP, 35.4±5.0 ng/g; CGRP, 103.8±22.1 ng/g), and declined gradually at 12 h and 24 h (VIP, 16.5±1.8 ng/g, 5.5±1.4 ng/g; CGRP, 34.9±9.7 ng/g, 18.5±7.7 ng/g), but were significantly increased again at 72 h (VIP, 48.7±9.5 ng/g; CGRP, 142.1±24.3 ng/g), then declined in various degrees on d 7 (VIP, 3.8±1.1 ng/g; CGRP, 102.5±18.1 ng/g). The CCK levels in jejunum were found to change in a similar trend as that in plasma with the concentrations of CCK significantly increased following TBI (99-517% increases) and peaked at 72 h. Conclusion: Traumatic brain injury can lead to significant changes of brain-gut peptides in both plasma and small intestine, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of complicated gastrointestinal dysfunction.

27644490398	Neuroprotective effect of lateral ventricle infusion of low-temperature fluid following focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rabbits	Background: Neuroprotective role of hypothermia on cerebral ischemic-reperfusional impairment has been long acknowledged. Since general hypothermia is complicated and unfit for observing postoperative consciousness and neurological function, it is of important significance to explore novel methods of focal cerebral hypothermia. Objective: To study the neuroprotective effect of lateral ventricle infusion of low-temperature fluid on ischemic neurons of middle cerebral artery (MAC) occlusion models established on New Zealand rabbits. Design: A randomized case-control study based on experimental animal models. Setting: Neurosurgical department and pathological department of a general military hospital of Chinese PLA. Materials: This study was carried out at Neurosurgical Laboratory of Nanjing General Hospital, Nanjing Military Area Command of Chinese PLA. Altogether 18 healthy New Zealand male rabbits, weighing from 2.8 to 3.2 kg, were selected 4 - 6 months after birth, and randomly divided into occlusion group, hypothermia group and control group. Interventions: Cerebral focal ischemic-reperfusional model was established on the New Zealand rabbits through MCA occlusion for 2 hours followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Main outcome measures: Scores for neurological function, water content in the left and right brain, pathological changes of nerve cells in the left MCA supplying region. Results: 1 Scores for neurological function was (2.48 ± 0.49) in hypothermia group, significantly higher than that in occlusion group (7.58 ± 0.58) (P < 0.01), but no significant difference could be observed in contrast with (1.13 ± 0.22) of control group (P > 0.05); 2 Water content of the left brain was (81.64 ± 0.82)% and (79.26 ± 1.30)% in occlusion and hypothermia groups with significant difference between them (P < 0.05), and it was significantly different between the left side [ (81.64 ± 0.82)%] and right side [ (78.47 ± 1.68)% ] in occlusion group (P < 0.01); 3 Karyopyknosis and deep staining could be observed in nerve ganglion cells in occlusion group under optical microscope, but no obvious pathological changes were observed in MCA supplying brain regions in hypothermia group. Conclusion: Permanent infusion of low-temperature fluid into the lateral ventricle plays an important neuroprotective role by attenuating cerebral ischemic-reperfusional impairment and improving post-ischemic neurological functions.

33645771239	Diffraction enhanced imaging computer tomography	Diffraction enhanced imaging is a new X-ray radiographic imaging method using monochromatic X-rays from a synchrotron source which produces high contrast and spatial resolution images of thick absorbing objects. Use of this method in medicine, material science and industrial applications in non-destructive testing is highlighted at present. The purpose of this study is to discuss diffraction enhanced imaging computer tomography which combines computer tomography (CT) and diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) method. Comparison between DEI-CT images and conventional X-ray CT images shows that the DEI-CT imaging technique gives not only surface information but also the internal structure of organs or soft tissues with high contrast. The obtained images show the micro-structures details of DEI-CT.

33746177696	A novel animal model for subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits - Pathology due to hemorrhage	The Pathophysiological course of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is not completely understood, such as how and why blood or its lysate can influence the brain. Although many SAH animal models have previously been reported, none are suitable for research in this field. The aim of the present study was to establish such an animal model. Twenty New Zealand rabbits were divided into two groups, a control group and a SAH group (n=10). Blood was lysed using an in vitro freeze-thaw method. After anesthesia, 0.9 ml of cerebrospinal fluid was drawn from both groups. An identical volume of heparinized hemolysate was then slowly injected into the cisterna magna of the SAH group animals. Control group animals while the control group received heparinized isotonic sodium chloride solution. Forty-eight hours post-injection, samples were excised after perfusion fixation for further determinations. The degree of cerebral vasospasm was evaluated by measuring the cross-sectional area of the basilar arterial lumen, and brain damage was examined by TUNEL staining. Weight, blood pressure and saturation of blood oxygen showed no statistical differences between groups. The cross-sectional area of the arterial lumen in the SAH group was roundly 0.402 mm

33750151332	Investigation of biological microstructures by using diffraction-enhanced imaging computed tomography	Diffraction-enhanced imaging computer tomography (DEI-CT) is a new method to provide the object's inner information. Previous reports demonstrated its applicability in soft and hard tissue imaging. Here, we provide further evidence for the improved overall image quality and for the option to distinguish the inner microstructures of the guinea pig's cochlea. Data has shown the details of the cochlea's inner microstructure such as vestibular membrane which only have 6 μm. A better knowledge of these microstructures may be relevant to achieve progress in the otology of clinical anatomization. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33845447236	Comparison between one- and two-hemorrhage models of cerebral vasospasm in rabbits	Injection of blood into the cisterna magna is one of the most frequently used methods to produce subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) models in animals. Although the two-hemorrhage model of vasospasm is frequently used in canine and rat models, most studies with rabbits only use the one-hemorrhage model. In the present study, we accomplished a side-by-side comparison between one- and two-hemorrhage models in rabbits. A total of 38 rabbits were randomly divided into three groups, i.e. control group (n = 5), one (n = 15)- and two (n = 18)-hemorrhage model groups. The degree of cerebral vasospasm, the time course of cerebral vasospasm, the clinical behavior, and the residual amount of subarachnoid blood clots were measured on days 3, 5 and 7 after the establishment of the models. Compared with one-hemorrhage model, the time course of vasospasm in the two-hemorrhage model was more coincident with that observed in humans, produced more severe vasospasm after SAH, and had an acceptable low mortality. In conclusion, the two-hemorrhage model in rabbits is more appropriate than the one-hemorrhage model for the research on SAH or cerebral vasospasm, and thus can be used for the investigation of the mechanisms of and therapeutic approaches for cerebral vasospasm. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33750963810	A micro-tomography method based on X-ray diffraction enhanced imaging for the visualization of micro-organs and soft tissues	Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) is one of the phase contrast imaging methods using the monochromatic X-ray from synchrotron, which provides information on the out-of-plane angular deviation of X-ray. DEI allows the investigation of micro-structures inside weakly absorbing samples at high spatial resolution without serious radiation exposure. Tomographic techniques can be applied readily to phase contrast images. The combination of DEI and tomography allows for a reconstruction of refractive index gradient distribution inside weakly absorbing samples with micrometer resolution, particularly suited for the 3D observation of micro-organisms and tissues. The existing phase contrast tomography methods based on DEI use phase contrast images as projections, such images contain not only the phase information, but also the absorption information. A novel method (DEI in the tomography mode) was developed to greatly increase the proportion of refraction information in phase contrast images by computing the difference between the two sets of images acquired at different angles of the rocking curve to adopt the projections with a complete set (2π) for reconstruction. The reconstructed images of cochlea of a guinea pig showed the spatial structures and the micro-features inside the samples. The new method reveals higher spatial resolution compared to the conventional phase contrast tomography methods and is more suitable to the investigation of micro-structures of micro-organisms and tissue materials. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33847796635	Application of synchrotron source based DEI method in guinea pig cochleae imaging	Hard X-ray diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI), which is based on a synchrotron source and monochromator-analyzer-crystal system, is an effective method for imaging X-ray phase shift. Utilizing an analyzer crystal with high angular sensitivity of micro-radian, DEI can measure the transmitted, refracted and scattered X-rays when projecting onto a sample. It dramatically improves the contrast and spatial resolution of the resultant images. At the topography station of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (BSRF), we implemented DEI method in guinea pig cochleae imaging and acquired a series of DEI images. Based on these images, the apparent absorption and refraction images were calculated. The DEI images revealed the holistic spiral structures and inner details of guinea pig cochleae clearly, even including the structures at the cellular level, such as the static cilia of hairy cells and the limbus of Hansen cell. Due to the advantages of high contrast, high spatial resolution and distinct edge-enhanced effect, DEI method promises extensive applications in biology, medicine and clinic in the near future.

33846923100	Diffraction enhanced X-ray imaging for observing guinea Pig Cochlea	Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) is a novel x-ray radiographic imaging method, which derives contrast from absorption, refraction, and extinction. With DEI technique, the spatial resolution of the acquired image can be increased 1000 times over conventional x-ray radiography. Therefore, it is suitable for the observation of biomedical micro-tissues and organs. This paper presents a new imaging method of minute biomedical organs based on DEI technique. In the investigation, the cochleae of guinea pigs were used as the samples. Before imaging, the cochleae of guinea pigs underwent different treatments, including fixation, decalcification, staining with silver nitrate solution, and reduction. Of them, the decalcification of cochleae is very important for improving the imaging quality. Compared with the conventional radiography image much higher contrast is achieved in the obtained DEI images. The fine spiral structure and inner details of the cochlea can be displayed clearly. The results show that compared with the conventional x-ray radiography, DEI is a more effective way of observing the guinea pig cochlear microstructures and other minute biomedical organs, and a potential tool for diagnosing cochlear diseases and morphologic study. © 2005 IEEE.

34147108607	Expression of Toll-like receptor 4 in the brain in a rabbit experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage model	Objective: To investigate the expression of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in the brain after experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in rabbits. Methods: A total of 52 rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: control group; day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups. Day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were all SAH groups in which the rabbits were killed on day 3, 5, and 7, respectively. In SAH groups, autologous arterial blood was injected into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2. Immunostaining and immunoblotting experiments were performed to detect the expression of TLR4 protein. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the presence and quantity of TLR4 mRNA. Results: The expressions of TLR4 protein and mRNA were increased remarkably in SAH groups compared with the control group. The immunohistochemical staining demonstrated high level expression of TLR4 was present mainly in the endothelial cells of capillaries in the brain. Conclusion: Our results indicate that TLR4 expression is upregulated in the brain after experimental SAH. © 2007 Birkhäuser Verlag.

34347239654	Visualization of guinea pig cochleae with computed tomography of diffraction enhanced imaging and comparison with histology	As a novel imaging method, X-ray diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) has extremely high sensitivity for weakly absorbing biological soft tissues. Recently, biomedical application research about DEI and computed tomography of DEI (DEI-CT) has become a hot issue. In this paper, a novel visualization method of micro biomedical structures is presented, which uses DEI-CT techniques to study guinea pig cochleae. The acquired DEI images clearly displayed the spiral structures and inner details of the guinea pig cochleae. DEI-CT reconstructions were obtained from the peak projection data and refraction angle projection data of guinea pig cochleae. Based on DEI-CT reconstructions, we implemented three-dimensional visualization of guinea pig cochleae. Moreover, visualization of guinea pig cochlea based on color images of the histological sections was performed for comparison with the results of DEI-CT. The advantages and limitations of the two methods in visualizing guinea pig cochleae are also discussed. This study demonstrates that DEI-CT is an effective method to visualize the biomedical micro-organs and minute tissues with a good contrast and spatial resolution. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors.

34548554170	Progesterone prevents traumatic brain injury-induced intestinal nuclear factor kappa B activation and proinflammatory cytokines expression in male rats	We have previously shown that traumatic brain injury (TBI) can induce an upregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and proinflammatory cytokines in the gut, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute gut mucosal injury mediated by inflammation. In this work, we investigated whether progesterone administration modulated intestinal NF-κB activity and proinflammatory cytokines expression after TBI in male rats. As a result, we found that administration of progesterone following TBI could decrease NF-κB binding activity, NF-κB p65 protein expression, and concentrations of interleukin- 1β (IL- 1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the gut. TBI-induced damages of gut structure were ameliorated after progesterone injections. The results of the present study suggest that the therapeutic benefit of post-TBI progesterone injections might be due to its inhibitory effects on intestinal NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokines expression.

34548567818	A detailed 3D model of the guinea pig cochlea	Several partial models of cochlear subparts are available. However, a complete 3D model of an intact cochlea based on actual histological sections has not been reported. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop a novel 3D model of the guinea pig cochlea and conduct post-processes on this reconstructed model. We used a combination of histochemical processing and the method of acquiring section data from the visible human project (VHP) to obtain a set of ideal raw images of cochlear sections. After semi-automatic registration and accurate manual segmentation with professional image processing software, one set of aligned data and six sets of segmented data were generated. Finally, the segmented structures were reconstructed by 3D Slicer (a professional imaging process and analysis tool). Further, post-processes including 3D visualization and a virtual endoscope were completed to improve visualization and simulate the course of the cochlear implant through the scala tympani. The 3D cochlea model contains the main six structures: (1) the inner wall, (2) modiolus and spiral lamina, (3) cochlea nerve and spiral ganglion, (4) spiral ligament and inferior wall of cochlear duct, (5) Reissner's membrane and (6) tectorial membrane. Based on the results, we concluded that ideal raw images of cochlear sections can be acquired by combining the processes of conventional histochemistry and photographing while slicing. After several vital image processing and analysis steps, this could further generate a vivid 3D model of the intact cochlea complete with internal details. This novel 3D model has great potential in teaching, basic medical research and in several clinical applications. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

34548131647	Potential contribution of nuclear factor-κB to cerebral vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits	Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a key role in inflammation, which is involved in the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In the present study, we assessed the potential role of NF-κB in regulation of cerebral vasospasm. Nuclear factor-κB DNA-binding activity was measured in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) treated with hemolysate and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 80 μmol/L), an inhibitor of NF-κB. Forty-two rabbits were divided into three groups: control, SAH, and PDTC groups (n=14 for each group). The caliber of the basilar artery was evaluated. Nuclear factor-κB DNA-binding activity and the gene expression levels of cytokines and adhesion molecules in the basilar artery were measured. Immunohistochemical study was performed to assess the expression and localization of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and myeloperoxidase (MPO). It was observed that NF-κB DNA-binding activity was significantly increased by treatment with hemolysate in cultured VSCMs, but this increase was suppressed by pretreatment with PDTC. Severe vasospasm was observed in the SAH group, which was attenuated in the PDTC group. Subarachnoid hemorrhage could induce increases of NF-κB DNA-binding activity and the gene expression levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, ICAM-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, which were reduced in the PDTC group. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that the expression levels of TNF-α, ICAM-1, and MPO were all increased in the SAH group, but these increases were attenuated in the PDTC group. Our results suggest that NF-κB is activated in the arterial wall after SAH, which potentially leads to vasospasm development through induction of inflammatory response. © 2007 ISCBFM All rights reserved.

34548853436	Expression of Toll-like receptor 4 in the basilar artery after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits: A preliminary study	Inflammation and immunity play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 is vital for inflammation and immunity. Therefore, this study aimed to detect the expression of TLR4 in the basilar artery in a rabbit SAH model and to clarify the potential role of TLR4 in cerebral vasospasm. A total of 48 rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: control group; day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups. Day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were all SAH groups. The animals in day 3, day 5 and day 7 groups were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were killed on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively. Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured and the TLR4 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The basilar arteries exhibited vasospasm after SAH and became more severe on day 3 and 5. The elevated expression of TLR4 was detected after SAH and peaked on day 3 and 5. TLR4 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of cerebral vasospasm in a rabbit experimental model of SAH. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

35348918813	Influence of glutamine on intestinal inflammatory response, mucosa structure alterations and apoptosis following traumatic brain injury in rats	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can induce a persistent inflammatory response, histopathological changes and apoptosis in the intestine. Glutamine has been shown to reduce bacterial translocation and maintain intestine mucosal integrity, but its effects on the inflammatory response, structural alterations and apoptosis in intestinal mucosa following TBI have not been previously investigated. Using the weight-drop method, a right parietal cortical contusion was induced in rats and, for the next 5 days, they were fed either chow alone or chow mixed with glutomine. Intestinal tissue samples were then removed for analysis. Following TBI, glutamine supplementation was found to: decrease intestinal concentrations of interleukin (IL) -1β, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6; downregulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression; attenuate TBI-induced damage to the intestine structure; and reduce apoptosis. These results suggest that post-TBI glutamine administration could suppress intestinal inflammation, protect intestinal mucosal structure and reduce mucosal apoptosis.

36749010176	Effect of epidural cooling on neuroprotection following focal cerebral ischemia: A histological observation	Objective: To observe the neuroprotective effect of epidural cooling on ischemic area following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Methods: Twelve healthy adult domestic swine were randomly assigned to normal temperature and low temperature groups (n = 6 in each group). Left permanent MCAO were performed in all the animals. One hour after cerebral ischemia, epidural hypothermic perfusion was performed with 4°C isotonic saline at the left apex of the head in the low temperature group. The brain surface deep hypothermia and deep brain tissure moderate hypothermia were maintained for five hours; the normal body temperature (range 37 - 39°C) was maintained for six hours in the normal temperature group. The changes of temperature,the infarct volume and histopathology of the brain in both groups were observed. Results: Temperature changes: The brain surface temperature decreased to 18.4 ± 1.7°C in 1 minute, the deep brain temperature decreased to 27.8 ± 0.5°C in 5 minutes, and the body temperature was maintained at 37.4 ± 0.7°C after epidural cooling in the low temperature group. Infarct volume: The percentage of infarct volume accounted for 5.6% and 13.7% of the left hemispfere, respectively in the low and normal temperature groups, and there was significant statistical difference. Histological observation: As compared with the normal temperature group, the infarcted foci in the ischemic regions were significantly reduced in the low temperature group, and the shape of neurons was almost normal. The color-lightened large infarctions foci were observed in the normal temperature group. The structure of brain tissue in the infarted regions was disturbed, the number of neurons reduced, their shape was irregular, the cell nuclei showed pyknosis and densely stained. Conclusions: Epidural cooling has significant neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemic area following MCAO in swine, and it may alleviate neuronal damage obviously.

38349048301	Activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway in brain after traumatic brain injury	Secondary brain injury plays a pivotal role in the outcome of patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). The mechanisms underlying secondary brain injury are complex and interrelated. Previous studies focused on one of these mechanisms have been proved to be ineffective in clinical practice. Therefore, a target, which can interrupt multi-mechanisms underlying TBI, is desirable. Nrf2-ARE pathway has been proved to be the key regulator in reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory damage and accumulation of toxic metabolites, which are all involved in TBI. However, whether Nrf2-ARE pathway is activated after TBI has not been studied. In the present study, the nuclear Nrf2 protein level was detected by Western blot, and the mRNA levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), two Nrf2-regulated gene products, were determined using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 24 h after TBI. Furthermore, we also localized the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 using immunohistochemical study. After TBI, the nuclear Nrf2 protein level was significantly increased, and the mRNA levels of both HO-1 and NQO1 were also up regulated. Moreover, both Nrf2 and HO-1 were localized in the same types of cells. According to these results, it could be postulated that Nrf2-ARE pathway was activated in brain after TBI. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

39749191246	Glutamine decreases intestinal nuclear factor kappa B activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after traumatic brain injury in rats	Objective: To investigate whether glutamine supplementation modulates intestinal nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. Materials and methods: Right parietal cortical contusion in male rats was made by the weight-dropping method. After trauma, the rats were randomly given chow alone or glutamine mixed chow for 5 d. Gut samples were extracted at 5 d postinjury. We measured NF-κB binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 expression by immunohistochemistry; the concentrations of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; intestinal mucosal morphological changes by histopathological study and electron microscopy; and apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining. Results: Administration of glutamine following TBI could decrease NF-κB binding activity, NF-κB p65 protein expression and concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the gut. TBI-induced damage of gut structure was ameliorated after glutamine supplementation. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that the therapeutic benefit of post-TBI glutamine supplementation might be due to its inhibitory effects on intestinal NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. © Birkhäuser Verlag, 2008.

58749101482	Inhibition of hemolysate-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression by genistein through suppression of NF-k{cyrillic}B activation in primary astrocytes	Genistein is a major isoflavone compound from soybean. We investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of genistein in primary astrocytes treated with hemolysate. The results indicated that genistein inhibited the expression of hemolysate induced iNOS and COX-2 mRNA on astrocytes. Furthermore, this compound inhibited the level of hemolysate-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-k{cyrillic}B). Therefore, we suggested that the effect of genistein-mediated inhibition of the expression hemolysate-induced iNOS and COX-2 genes is due to under the suppression of NF-k{cyrillic}B activation in the transcriptional level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

58849137494	Hemolysate-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells via through ROS-dependent NF-κB pathways	In order to determine the possible effects of hemolysate on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), we examined the effects of hemolysate on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and NF-κB activation in rat BMECs. Hemolysate induced the expression of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in endothelial cells. In addition, hemolysate stimulated nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, and NF-κB DNA-binding activity in BMECs. Furthermore, hemolysate increased ROS generation, and hemolysate-induced ICAM-1and MCP-1 expression and NF-κB activation were abrogated in the presence of the direct scavenger of ROS. Taken together, our results indicate that hemolysate can induce inflammatory responses that increase expression of ICAM-1 and MCP-1, through ROS-dependent NF-κB activation in BMECs. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

60549084888	Genetic ablation of Nrf2 enhances susceptibility to acute lung injury after traumatic brain injury in mice	Previous studies have shown that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a unique role in many physiological stress processes. The present study investigated the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Wild-type Nrf2 (+/+) and Nrf2 (-/-)- deficient mice were subjected to a moderately severe weight- drop impact head injury. Pulmonary capillary permeability (PCP), wet/dry weight ratio, apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes were measured at 24 h after TBI. Mice lacking Nrf2 were found to be more susceptible to TBI-induced ALI, as characterized by the higher increase in PCP, wet/dry weight ratio and alveolar cells apoptosis after TBI. This exacerbation of lung injury in Nrf2-deficient mice was associated with increased pulmonary mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1 β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6); and with decreased pulmonary mRNA expression and enzymatic activities of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes including NAD(P)H:qui- none oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase α1 (GST-α1)-as compared with their wild-type Nrf2 (+/+) counterparts after TBI. The results of the present study suggest that Nrf2 reduces TBI-induced acute lung injury, possibly by decreasing pulmonary inflammation and inducing antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes.

80052645792	Low dose reconstruction algorithm for differential phase contrast imaging	Differential phase contrast imaging computed tomography (DPCI-CT) is a novel X-ray inspection method to reconstruct the distribution of refraction index rather than the attenuation coefficient in weakly absorbing samples. In this paper, we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm for DPCI-CT which benefits from the new compressed sensing theory. We first realize a differential algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) by discretizing the projection process of the differential phase contrast imaging into a linear partial derivative matrix. In this way the compressed sensing reconstruction problem of DPCI reconstruction can be transformed to a resolved problem in the transmission imaging CT. Our algorithm has the potential to reconstruct the refraction index distribution of the sample from highly undersampled projection data. Thus it can significantly reduce the dose and inspection time. The proposed algorithm has been validated by numerical simulations and actual experiments. © 2011-V IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

5044225699	Effect of systemic LPS injection on cortical NF-κB activity and inflammatory response following traumatic brain injury in rats	The aim of current study is to investigate the effect of systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the temporal pattern of cortical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) binding activity, inflammatory response and secondary damage in the injured brain following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Right parietal cortical contusion in rats was made by using weight-dropping method. The rats were randomly divided into sham, LPS, TBI and TBI-LPS groups, with LPS injected intraperitoneally. NF-κB binding activity, cytokines, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and brain damage were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis, respectively. The results showed that systemic administration of LPS following TBI could induce an immediate, strong and persistent upregulation of NF-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ICAM-1 in the area surrounding the injured brain. As compared with rats of sham, LPS and TBI groups, NF-κB binding activity, TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly upregulated in the surrounding cortex of injured site as early as 3 h postinjury when challenged with LPS, kept at high level up to 7-days postinjury. ICAM-1-positive vessels and apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells in the injured brain were also significantly increased in TBI-LPS rats. It was concluded that inflammatory response and secondary brain damage occurred in the injured brain could be highly exacerbated by endotoxemia. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

52949102948	Increased intestinal inflammatory response and gut barrier dysfunction in Nrf2-deficient mice after traumatic brain injury	Aim: To explore the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced intestinal inflammatory response and gut barrier dysfunction in the mice. Methods: Wild-type Nrf2 (+/+) and Nrf2 (-/-)-deficient mice were subjected to a moderately severe weight-drop impact-acceleration head injury. We measured nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA); tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by immunohistochemistry; intestinal permeability by lactulose/mannitol (L/M) test; plasma endotoxin by chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate test. Results: Intestinal levels of NF-κB, pro-inflammatory cytokines and ICAM-1 in Nrf2 (-/-)-deficient mice were significantly higher compared with Nrf2 (+/+) mice at 24 h after TBI. Furthermore, higher intestinal permeability and plasma level of endotoxin were observed in the Nrf2 (-/-) mice compared with Nrf2 (+/+) mice. Conclusion: Nrf2 plays an important protective role in limiting intestinal inflammatory response and gut barrier dysfunction after TBI. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

53349097880	Neuronavigation-assisted microsurgery for treatment of the distal anterior choroidal artery aneurysms	Objective: To investigate the method and effect of neuronavigation-assisted microsurgery for treatment of the aneurysms distal anterior choroidal artery (AchA). Methods: The optimal surgical approach was designed assistantly by using the neuronavigation technique. The important brain functional areas were avoided under the guidance of neuronavigation during the operation, and the lesions were located precisely. The microsurgical clipping of aneurysm of the distal AchA was performed in 3 patients. Results: The neuronavigation machine showed that systematic error ranged from 1.2 to 2.7 mm (mean 1.83 mm) in the 3 patients. Under the guidance of neuronavigation system, the aneurysms were found and clipped successfully by using microscopic and minimally invasive techniques during the operation. Cerebral angiography demonstrated that 3 aneurysms were clipped completely after the procedure. No operate related neurological deficits were found, and the repeated angiography showed no aneurysmal remnant found. All the 3 patients were life-independent after more than 3-month follow-up. The muscle strength of upper and lower limbs at the left side in one patient recovered to grade IV (it was grade III before the procedure). The muscle strength of the other 2 patients was grade V. Conclusion: Neuronavigation may precisely locate the aneurysm of the distal AchA in deep site, and help to avoid severe neurological deficits and improve the prognosis of patients. It is an effective assistant means in the management of the AchA.

Methods: A total of 36 male New Zealand white rabbits were selected, and they were randomly allocated into control, SAH, and EPO groups (n = 12 in each group). Delayed cerebral vasospasm was induced by using a SAH model of injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna. The dose of EPO was 1000 IU/(kg · 8 h), and it was injected intraperitoneally for 5 days. The animals were killed 5 days after the model established. Their basilar arteries were obtained and the cross-section area was detected by HE staining. The NF-κB binding activity was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results: 1 The lumen's cross-sectional areas of basilar arteries in the control, SAH and EPO groups were 0.412 ± 0.034, 0.210 ± 0.018, and 0.342 ± 0.030 mm

60249102843	Ketogenic diet reduces cytochrome c release and cellular apoptosis following traumatic brain injury in juvenile rats	Ketone bodies have been shown to be favorable alternative metabolic substrates and are protective under neuropathologies. At the same time, cytochrome c release has been reported following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and precipitates apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. The present study investigated the effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) on TBI. TBI was produced using the Feeney weight-drop model and the animals were fed either normal diet (ND) or KD. Brain edema was estimated by wet/dry weight ratio; cytochrome c was detected by Western blotting; cellular apoptosis in the penumbra area was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and active caspase-3 immunohistochemical staining. The results show that brain edema, cytochrome c release, and cellular apoptosis were induced after TBI and that KD reduced these changes dramatically. These findings suggest that KD has potential therapeutic benefit in TBI. © 2009 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.

61449243573	Hemangiopericytomas in the central nervous system	Hemangiopericytomas, which are more aggressive than meningiomas, are rare in the central nervous system (CNS). We analyzed the clinical, radiological and histological features and treatment of 26 patients with hemangiopericytomas in the CNS. The ratio of male to female patients was 1:1. Most tumors were located in the parasagittal and falx regions. The tumors were dense or mixed as assessed by CT scans, and most were homogeneously enhanced. Most tumors were isointense on T1-weighted MRI, and high or mixed intensity on T2-weighted MRI; they were homogeneously or heterogeneously enhanced. Histological examination indicated numerous small vascular spaces in the tumor. All tumors were immunohistochemically positive for vimentin. All patients were treated with surgery, and some of them underwent subsequent radiotherapy. The recurrence rate for hemangiopericytoma in this study was high. Our observations suggest that the biological behavior of hemangiopericytoma differs markedly from that of meningioma. Surgical removal and post-operative radiotherapy are thus critical for the treatment of this tumor. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

62549140078	N-acetylcysteine suppresses oxidative stress in experimental rats with subarachnoid hemorrhage	The neuroprotective effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a sulfhydryl-containing antioxidant, on experimentally induced subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats was assessed. NAC was administered to rats after the induction of SAH. Neurological deficits and brain edema were investigated. The activity of antioxidant defense enzymes, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), were measured in the brain cortex by spectrophotometer. The content of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) was also analyzed. We found that NAC markedly reversed the SAH-induced neurological deficit and brain edema. We further investigated the mechanism involved in the neuroprotective effects of NAC on rat brain tissue and found that NAC significantly increased CuZn-SOD and GSH-Px activity and decreased MDA content in the SAH brain. NAC has the potential to be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SAH, and its neuroprotective effect may be partly mediated via enhancing the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting free radical generation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

62049084483	Expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the cerebral artery after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage	Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent chemokine that plays an important role in the recruitment of macrophages. Although previous studies have demonstrated that MCP-1 has been shown to be involved in the damaging inflammatory processes associated with stroke, infection, neoplasia, and others in the central nervous system, the role of MCP-1 in the cerebral artery after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats has been largely unexplored. This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of the MCP-1 in SAH model and to clarify the potential role of MCP-1 in cerebral vasospasm. A total of 80 rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group; day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups. Day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were all SAH groups. The animals in day 3, day 5 and day 7 groups were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were killed on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively. Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured and the MCP-1 expression was assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The cross-sectional area of basilar artery was found to be 85,373 ± 8794 μm

65249162172	Genistein, a soybean isoflavone, reduces the production of pro-inflammatory and adhesion molecules induced by hemolysate in brain microvascular endothelial cells	Genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone) is the most abundant isoflavone found in the soybean that exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect. The present study was designed to examine the effects of genistein on expression levels of hemolysate-induced proinflammatory and adhesion molecules in SD rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Genistein treatment attenuated hemolysate-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-xB) p65 translocation in BMECs. In addition, genistein suppressed the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The inhibitory rate of 50 μM genistein for TNF-α, MCP-1 and ICAM-1 was 65.4%, 60.5% and 54.9% respectively. These inhibitory effects of genistein on proinflammatory and adhesion molecules were not due to decreased BMEC viability as assessed by MTT test. Taken together the present study suggests that genistein suppresses expression levels of hemolysate-induced pro-inflammatory and adhesion molecules in cerebral endothelial cells.

67650526683	The protective effect of the ketogenic diet on traumatic brain injury-induced cell death in juvenile rats	Background: The ketogenic diet (the KD) is an effective treatment for intractable epilepsy, especially in the paediatric population, and a growing number of studies have shown the neuroprotective role of the KD. However, few studies focused on the neuroprotective effects of the KD in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the KD on TBI. Methods and procedures: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60) were randomly divided into four groups according to the diet fed (the KD vs normal diet) and whether brain was injured or not. TBI was produced using Feeney weight drop model. Brain oedema was estimated by wet/dry weight ratio; Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were determined by RealTime-PCR; Bax and Bcl-2 protein levels were detected by Western blot. Furthermore, cellular apoptosis in the penumbra area was examined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) method. Main outcomes and results: The results indicated that both Bax mRNA and protein levels were significantly elevated 72 hours after TBI and decreased by KD administration. Neither TBI nor the KD affected Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels. KD administration also reduced brain oedema and cellular apoptosis. Conclusion: These results suggest that the KD might be a useful treatment for children suffering from the consequences of TBI.

70450235482	Transcription Factor Nrf2 Plays a Pivotal Role in Protection Against Traumatic Brain Injury-Induced Acute Intestinal Mucosal Injury in Mice	Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can induce an acute intestinal mucosal injury. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has a unique role in many physiological stress processes, but its contribution to intestinal mucosal injury after TBI remains to be determined. Materials and Methods: Wildtype Nrf2 (+/+) and Nrf2 (-/-) deficient mice were subjected to a moderately severe weight-drop impact head injury. Intestinal mucosal morphological changes, plasma endotoxin, intestinal permeability, apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, and antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes were measured at 24 hours after TBI. Results: Nrf2 deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to TBI-induced acute intestinal mucosal injury, as characterized by the higher increase in gut structure damage, plasma endotoxin, intestinal permeability, and apoptosis after TBI. This exacerbation of intestinal mucosal injury in Nrf2 deficient mice was associated with increased intestinal mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6, and with decreased intestinal mRNA expression and activity levels of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes including NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase α-1 (GST-α1), compared with their wildtype Nrf2 (+/+) counterparts after TBI. Conclusions: We show for the first time that mice lacking Nrf2 are more susceptible to TBI-induced acute intestinal mucosal injury. Our data suggests that Nrf2 plays an important role in protecting TBI-induced intestinal mucosal injury, possibly by regulating of inflammatory cytokines and inducing of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

How to extract phase information from raw images measured in different positions of rocking curve is the key problem of DEI. In this paper, we present an effective extraction method called polynomial curve fitting method, in order to extract accurate information angular in a fast speed. It is compared with the existing methods such as multiple-images statistical method and Gaussian curve fitting method. The experiments results on a plastic cylinder and a black ant at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility prove that the polynomial curve fitting method can obtain most approximate refraction-angle values and its computation speed is 10 times faster than the Gaussian curve fitting method. © 2009 Chinese Physical Society.

77649239163	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone attenuates oxyhemoglobin-induced Toll-like receptor 4 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells	Inflammation and immune response have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recently, increased TLR4 expression has been associated with the development of cerebral vasospasm in a rabbit model of SAH. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists, effective inhibitors of TLR4 activation, may modulate the vasospasm progression via their anti-inflammation effects. We investigate whether the blood component oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) can induce the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and evaluate the modulatory effects of PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone on OxyHb-induced inflammation in VSMCs. Cultured VSMCs incubated with or without rosiglitazone were exposed to OxyHb at 10 μM for up to 48 h. Expression of TLR4 was assessed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in conditioned medium were quantified by ELISA. A marked increase of TLR4 production and TNF-α release was observed at 48 h after cells were treated with OxyHb. Rosiglitazone reduced TLR4 immunocytochemistry staining and protein production significantly in VSMCs. A specific antagonist for PPARγ, GW9662, could reverse the anti-inflammatory effects of rosiglitazone. The results demonstrated that OxyHb exposure could induce TLR4 activation in cultured VSMCs. Rosiglitazone suppressed TLR4 expression and cytokine release via the activation of PPARγ and may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of vasospasm following SAH. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77956192954	Analysis of the efficacy and influencing factors of intracranial aneurysm embolization-induced oculomotor nerve palsy	Objective: To observe the clinical efficacy and influencing factors of interventional intracranial aneurysm embolization-induced oculomotor nerve palsy. Methods: The clinical data of 18 consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysmembolization-induced oculomotor nerve palsy were analyzed retrospectively. The relationships between the recovery of oculomotor palsy and the degree of preoperative palsy (complete, incomplete), time from onset to treatment (≤14d, >14d), size of aneurism (≤7mm, >7mm), with or without preoperative hemorrhage, and the compactness of embolization (complete, residual neck) were analyzed. All the patients were followed up for 24 months. Results: Circled digit oneAll the aneurysms of 18 patients were embolized successfully. The aneurysms of the 12 patients were embolized completely, and 6 had residual necks. Circled digit twoThe oculomotor palsy in 11 of the 18 patients recovered completely, 6 recovered partially. The total improving rate was 94.4%; one patient with recurrence of the aneurysm did not showed any improvement. Circled digit threeThere were no significant differences in the seriousness of preoperative oculomotor palsy, time from onset to treatment, size of aneurysm, with or without subarachnoid hemorrhage, and compactness of embolization on the recovery of oculomotor nerve palsy (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Aneurysm embolization may effectively improve aneurysm-induced oculomotor palsy. If no any improvement after embolization, recanalization of the aneurysm should be considered.

77957332669	Potential role of Ras in cerebral vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits	Previous studies have demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Ras, an upstream regulator of MAPK, may be activated following SAH. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Ras in cerebral vasospasm in a rabbit model of SAH. We first investigated the time course of Ras and ERK1/2 activation in the basilar artery after SAH. Next, for the time point at which Ras was maximally activated, we assessed the effect of FTI-277 (a Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor) on cerebral vasospasm. SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna on both day 0 and day 2. FTI-277 was injected into the cisterna magna every 24 hours, beginning 30 minutes after blood injection to the last day of the experiment. Elevated expression of Ras-GTP and phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected in the basilar artery after SAH and expression peaked on day 3. FTI-277 administration resulted in lower Ras-GTP and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels and markedly attenuated vasospasm in the basilar arteries relative to animals that did not receive FTI-277. Our results suggest that Ras protein is activated in the arterial wall after SAH and contributes to vasospasm development. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77958071059	Sulforaphane attenuates matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression following spinal cord injury in mice	Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). The present study explored the effect of sulforaphane (SFN), a potent anti-inflammatory extract of cruciferous vegetables, on the expression of two inflammatory mediators, metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and TNF-α, in a murine model of SCI. Murine spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 10 g) to the dura after a three-level T8-T10 laminectomy. The wet/dry weight ratio was used to reflect the percentage of water content of impaired spinal cord tissue at 48 hr after SCI. The mRNA levels of MMP-9 were determined using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein levels of TNF-α and MMP-9 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) at 24 hr after SCI. Gelatin zymography was used to determine MMP-9 activity of spinal cord tissue at 24 hr after SCI. Mice treated with SFN at 1 hr after SCI had lower expression and activity of MMP-9 compared to mice with SCI. The decrease of MMP-9 in mice treated with SFN was associated with decreased levels of spinal cord water content and TNF-α. In summary, suforaphane decreases MMP-9 and TNF-α expression and vascular permeability changes following spinal cord injury in mice. © 2010 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.

79952490456	Low-dose multiple-information retrieval algorithm for X-ray grating-based imaging	The present work proposes a low dose information retrieval algorithm for X-ray grating-based multiple-information imaging (GB-MII) method, which can retrieve the attenuation, refraction and scattering information of samples by only three images. This algorithm aims at reducing the exposure time and the doses delivered to the sample. The multiple-information retrieval problem in GB-MII is solved by transforming a nonlinear equations set to a linear equations and adopting the nature of the trigonometric functions. The proposed algorithm is validated by experiments both on conventional X-ray source and synchrotron X-ray source, and compared with the traditional multiple-image-based retrieval algorithm. The experimental results show that our algorithm is comparable with the traditional retrieval algorithm and especially suitable for high Signal-to-Noise system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79955701023	Therapeutic potential of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone in cerebral vasospasm after a rat experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage model	The pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm is closely associated with inflammation and immune response in arterial walls. Recently, the authors proved the key role of Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 in the development of vasospasm in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) model. Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonists are identified as effective inhibitors of TLR4 activation, we investigated the anti-inflammation properties of PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone in basilar arteries in a rat experimental SAH model and evaluated the effects of rosiglitazone on vasospasm. Inflammatory responses in basilar arteries were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for intercellular molecule (ICAM)-1 and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Expression of TLR4 was determined by western blot analysis. The degree of cerebral vasospasm was evaluated by measuring the mean diameter and cross-sectional area of basilar arteries. Rosiglitazone suppressed the SAH-induced inflammatory responses in basilar arteries by inhibiting the TLR4 signalling. Furthermore, rosiglitazone could attenuate cerebral vasospasm following SAH. Therefore, we suggested that PPAR-gamma agonists may be potential therapeutic agents for cerebral vasospasm. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79960288667	Phase-contrast tomosynthetic experiment on biological samples with synchrotron radiation	Tomosynthesis is one of three-dimensional imaging techniques that can remove the effect of overlapping phenomena in radiography, except for computed tomography (CT). In general, CT needs at least hundreds of projections to reconstruct every cross-sectional slice of the samples accurately, while tomosynthesis just requires dozens of projections to reconstruct a series of tomosynthetic slices approximately, Conventional tomosynthesis based on attenuation contrast shows poor results when imaging weakly-absorption objects such as biological samples. In this paper, we present a new type of tomosynthesis, named phase contrast tomosynthesis, combining X-ray phase-contrast imaging mechanism and tomosynthesis, which can obtain higher resolution and image quality for the biological samples with fewer radiation doses and avoid overlapping phenomena. A phase contrast tomosynthetic experiment on a guinea pig cochlea at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) was done to evaluate the performances of various reconstruction algorithms integrated with the in-line phase retrieval method. © 2010 IEEE.

84855390358	Inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway attenuates cerebral vasospasm following experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits	The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays an important role in apoptosis and is also involved in the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Here, we sought to examine whether inhibition of p38 MAPK could attenuate cerebral vasospasm and investigate the underlying mechanisms in a rabbit SAH model. SAH was established in rabbits (n=12/group) using the double-hemorrhage method. We observed apparent vasospasm in the basilar arteries of rabbits with SAH, which was significantly attenuated by SB203580, a selective p38MAPK inhibitor. Immunoblotting assays showed enhanced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ATF2 and increased caspase-3 cleavage following SAH, which were, however, markedly suppressed by SB203580. TUNEL staining further revealed significant apoptosis in the basilar arteries of rabbits with SAH, which was scantly present in rabbits treated with SB203580. Our results demonstrated that p38 MAPK was activated in cerebral vasospasm and associated with increased apoptosis in the basilar arteries and p38 MAPK inhibition suppressed apoptosis, suggesting that p38 MAPK could be a novel therapeutic target for cerebral vasospasm. © 2011 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.

84885172703	The value and limitations of contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography for the detection of prostate cancer	Objectives To evaluate the role of contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography (CE-TRUS) for detecting prostate carcinoma. Methods Sixty-five patients with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were assessed using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and CE-TRUS. In all the patients, CE-TRUS was performed with intravenous injection of contrast agent (SonoVue, 2.4 ml) before biopsy. The cancer detection rates of the two techniques were compared. False-positive and false-negative findings related to CE-TRUS were analyzed in comparison to the pathological results of biopsy or radical prostatectomy. The targeted biopsy to abnormal CE-TRUS areas was also compared to systematic biopsy. Results Prostate cancer was detected in 29 of the 65 patients. CE-TRUS showed rapid focal enhancement or asymmetric vessels of peripheral zones in 28 patients; 23 of them had prostate cancer. CE-TRUS had 79.3% sensitivity, compared to 65.5% of TRUS (P < 0.05). There were five false-positive and six false-negative findings from CE-TRUS. Benign prostate hyperplasia, and acute and chronic prostatitis were important causes related to the false-positive results of CE-TRUS. Prostate cancer originating from the transition zone or peripheral zone with lower PSA levels, small-size foci, and moderately or well-differentiated tumor was missed by CE-TRUS. The cancer detection rate of targeted biopsy (75%, 33/44 cores) was significantly higher than one of systematic biopsy (48.2%, 162/336) in those 28 cases (P < 0.05). In addition, no significant correlation was found between the cancer detection rate with CE-TRUS and serum PSA levels. Conclusion CE-TRUS may improve the detection rate of prostate cancer through targeted biopsy of contrast-enhanced abnormalities. Our findings indicate that systematic biopsies should not be eliminated on the basis of false-positive and false-negative findings related to CE-TRUS. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84889045888	Research on correlation of CT iterative reconstruction algorithm with CT image quality and radiation dosage	Objective: To explore the influences of multi-slice spiral CT iterative reconstruction algorithm on image quality and exposure dose. Methods: Using both algorithms-iterative reconstruction algorithm (IR) and filtered back-projection reconstruction algorithm (FBP) on the Philips Brilliance 64 CT scanner iDose V3. 5 platform, the homogeneity, level of noise and resolution ratio of the Catphan 500 model were acquired and compared between the two groups using Wilcoxon test. Routine CT images of 20 abdomen, 20 skull and 20 temporal bone were achieved and reconstructed using IR as IR group. Sixty routine CT images were randomly selected and divided into 3 groups with 20 in each group, which were reconstructed using FBP as FBP group. Wilcoxon test was used to compare the image quality grades and the radiation does between these two groups. Results: Model scanning: With CTDIvol of 5.6, 8.0, 16.1, 24.1 and 32.2 mGy, the noise of IR group (1.45%, 0.96%, 0.68%, 0.53% and 0.47%, respectively) were lower than those of FBP group (1.74%, 1.14%, 0.77%, 0.61% and 0.53%, respectively) (Z = - 2.023, P = 0.043). There were no statistical differences in homogeneity, high-contrast resolution and low-contrast resolution between the two groups (P > 0.05). (2) Clinical patients: the abdominal CTDIvol of FBP and IR groups were (16.89 ± 2.19) mGy and (11.06 ± 4.15) mGy, respectively. CTDIvol of IR group was 34.52% lower with statistic difference (Z = - 3.398, P = 0.001). The objective scores were (3.75 ± 0.34) and (3.59 ± 0.39), respectively. There was no statistical difference (Z = - 1.660, P = 0.097). Images of both IR and FBP group could clearly show brain structures and lesions. CTDIvol of FBP group was (48.23 ± 2.59) mGy; CTDIvol of IR group was (43.82 ± 1.09) mGy using 1st level iterative reconstruction and (42.91 ± 0.81) mGy using 5th level iterative reconstruction. There were statistical differences between FBP group and IR group using 1st level and 5th level (Z = - 3.775 and -3.812, P=0.001). The image quality grade of FBP group was (3.63 ± 0.45), and that of IR group using 1st level iterative reconstruction was (3.68 ± 0.40). There was no statistical difference (Z = - 1.660, P =0.097). The image quality grade of IR group using 5th level iterative reconstruction was (1.83 ± 0.33), there was statistical difference (Z = - 3.952, P = 0.001). The temporal CTDIvol of FBP group and IR group were (57.97 ± 1.89) mGy and (28.31 ± 0.63) mGy, respectively. CTDIvol of IR group was 51.16% lower with statistic difference (Z = - 4.300, P = 0.001). The contrast and acutance of images of both groups decreased. The subjective score were (4.40 ± 0.73) and (3.90 ± 0.76), respectively; there was statistical difference (Z = - 2.055, P = 0.040). Conclusions: Under the condition that the images quality meets the demand of diagnosis, CT iterative reconstruction algorithm may effectively reduce exposure dose. The iterative level should be selected in step with anatomic characteristics. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

0347598017	Alterations of intestinal mucosa structure and barrier function following traumatic brain injury in rats	Aim: Gastrointestinal dysfunction is a common complication in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the effect of traumatic brain injury on intestinal mucosa has not been studied previously. The aim of the current study was to explore the alterations of intestinal mucosa morphology and barrier function, and to determine how rapidly the impairment of gut barrier function occurs and how long it persists following traumatic brain injury. Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (6 rats each group) including controls without brain injury and traumatic brain injury groups at hours 3, 12, 24, and 72, and on day 7. The intestinal mucosa structure was detected by histopathological examination and electron microscopy. Gut barrier dysfunction was evaluated by detecting serum endotoxin and intestinal permeability. The level of serum endotoxin and intestinal permeability was measured by using chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate and lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio, respectively. Results: After traumatic brain injury, the histopathological alterations of gut mucosa occurred rapidly as early as 3 hours and progressed to a serious state, including shedding of epithelial cells, fracture of villi, focal ulcer, fusion of adjacent villi, dilation of central chyle duct, mucosal atrophy, and vascular dilation, congestion and edema in the villous interstitium and lamina propria. Apoptosis of epithelial cells, fracture and sparseness of microvilli, loss of tight junction between enterocytes, damage of mitochondria and endoplasm, were found by electron microscopy. The villous height, crypt depth and surface area in jejunum decreased progressively with the time of brain injury. As compared with that of control group (183.7±41.8 EU/L), serum endotoxin level was significantly increased at 3, 12, and 24 hours following TBI (434.8±54.9 EU/L, 324.2±61.7 EU/L and 303.3±60.2 EU/L, respectively), and peaked at 72 hours (560.5±76.2 EU/L), then declined on day 7 (306.7±62.4 EU/L, P<0.01). Two peaks of serum endotoxin level were found at hours 3 and 72 following TBI. L/M ratio was also significantly higher in TBI groups than that in control group (control, 0.0172±0.0009; 12 h, 0.0303±0.0013; 24 h, 0.0354±0.0025; 72 h, 0.0736±0.0105; 7 d, 0.0588±0.0083; P<0.01). Conclusion: Traumatic brain injury can induce significant damages of gut structure and impairment of barrier function which occur rapidly as early as 3 hours following brain injury and lasts for more than 7 days with marked mucosal atrophy.
