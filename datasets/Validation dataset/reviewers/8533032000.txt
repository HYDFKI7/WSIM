8844284366	Application of microcontact printing technique on surface patterning	The application of microcontact printing technique (μCP) on surface patterning was reviewed, including creating patterns with different physical and chemical properties on self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surface and on polymer surface. The μCP technique has been successfully used in the fields of biomacromolecular microarrays, cell selective adhesion and function regulation, and in wetting/dewetting studies as well. The μCP technique and its new development were discussed, especially for patterning biomacromolecules on non-SAM surfaces. Factors such as depth feature of the stamp, solution concentration and surface soakage, contact pressure and time, as well as drying and rinsing on the nature of the transferred pattern have also been analyzed briefly.

18244389706	Modulating DNA bending affects NodD-mediated transcriptional control in Rhizobium leguminosarum	Rhizobium leguminosarum NodD binds to the nod box of the inducible nod gene nodA as a V-shaped tetramer and bends the nod box. In this work, we show that the nod gene inducer naringenin decreased gel mobility of nod box DNA-NodD complexes by sharpening the NodD-induced DNA bend, which correlated with nodA transcription activation. NodD can induce different DNA bends when the distance between the two half-sites of the nod box was modified, which severely affected NodD-mediated transcriptional control. One or two base pairs were deleted from, or inserted into, the two half-sites of the nod box of nod A. Circular permutation assays showed that such distance modulations allowed NodD to induce relaxed or sharpened DNA bending. In the case of 1 bp deletion, where the DNA bends were more relaxed than in the wild type, nod A transcription was repressed both in the absence and in the presence of inducer naringenin. In the cases of 1 and 2 bp insertion, where the DNA bends were much sharper than in wild type in the absence or presence of the inducer naringenin, nodA transcription was initiated constitutively with no requirement for the inducer naringenin or, even, the NodD regulating protein. © The Author 2005.

1842679217	Micropatterning Biomacromolecules on Aldehyde-Enriched Polyester Surfaces by a Microtransfer Technique	A modified microtransfer technique was introduced to create micropatterns of biomacromolecules on activated polyester surfaces. Briefly, a recessed poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp was first coated with a biomacromolecule solution. After drying the solution and selectively removing the biomacromolecules on the ridges, the stamp was stored at low temperature and high humidity to form a condensed water layer. The stamp was subsequently pressed onto the activated polyester surfaces to yield the biomacromolecular patterns. The notable feature of this method is that the reaction between the biomacromolecules and the polymer surface could be performed at a comparable speed to that in solution. Using this method, albumin and chitosan were micropatterned onto aldehyde-enriched polycaprolactone or poly-(L-lactic acid) surfaces. Observations under confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that the albumin or chitosan patterns formed by this microtransfer technique had higher contrast and good stability. The amount of water condensed on the stamp surface had significant influence on the quality of the resultant patterns. Deficient water produced rimming patterns, while excessive water caused the contamination of the patterns because of the overflow of the condensed water. This technique will be especially useful to those systems with lower reaction activity in the absence of solvent and hence can be applied widely to create patterns of biomacromolecules on polymer surfaces.

1842869949	Expression and purification of Rhizobium leguminosarum NodD	A Rhizobium expression system was constructed via introducing strong transcriptional elements to an IncP broad host range plasmid pKT230. Using this system, the nodD gene of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae was overexpressed in its own in vivo environment. Western blot showed that the NodD yield of the newly constructed expression vector pKNDT was much higher than that of a reported vector pIJ1518. Based on the result from quantitative gel retardation assay, the specific DNA-binding activity of NodD was estimated to increase by about 80-fold. Purification of NodD was performed by the sequential steps: polyethyleneimine treatment, ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation, and cellulose phosphate P11 chromatography. About 26 mg NodD with a purity about 90% was obtained from 14g wet weight cell pellet within 2 days. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

22144440530	Epidemiologic study of the predisposing factors in erythema toxicum neonatorum	Background: Erythema toxicum neonatorum (ETN) is a very common disease, but its predisposing factors are still unknown. Objective: To determine the predisposing factors of ETN. Methods: Seven hundred and eighty-three neonates born in the same hospital during the same period were investigated, and the factors predisposing to ETN were evaluated in a case-control study. Results: (1) The incidence of ETN is about 43.68%, and it is significantly higher in males than in females (p < 0.001). (2) Term birth (p < 0.05), first-pregnancy birth (p < 0.001), the birth season (summer and autumn, p < 0.005), being fed with milk powder substitute or a mixed diet (p < 0.001) and vaginal delivery (p < 0.001) are the predisposing factors of ETN. (3) The severity of ETN in neonates born by vaginal delivery is significantly correlated with the total length of labor (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that environmental factors play an important role in the onset of ETN. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

24144495066	Printing biomacromolecules on a bovine serum albumin precursor layer	Various biomacromolecules including proteins and polysaccharides are printed on a substrate capped with a bovine serum albumin (BSA) precursor layer to create clear co-patterns of these molecules. Characterizations by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) demonstrate the successful production and clear boundaries of the co-patterns. Rinsing the BSA-adsorbed substrate and the biomacromolecules-inked stamp before microcontact printing (μCP) is crucial for the creation of clear and stable co-patterns. The patterns are mainly stabilized by electrostatic interactions and van der Waals forces. Characterizations by ellipsometry, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy reveal that printing by a flat PDMS stamp yields a denser layered structure of proteins with a higher amount than that of adsorbed proteins. By printing, however, a lower enzymatic catalytic activity for horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or binding capability for avidin (both normalized to amount) is determined. A conformational transition from α-helix to β-sheet of HRP is observed by ATR-IR. By contrast, a BSA precursor layer can effectively improve the functionality of the printed HRP or avidin and preserve the original confermation of the proteins, although the absolute transferred amount of these proteins is decreased. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2442433801	Promoting of melanocyte adhesion and migration by Malytea Scurfpea fruit in vitro	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Malytea Scurfpea Fruit (MSF) on melanocyte adhesion and migration. Human epidermal melanocytes were treated with MSF and examined for adhesion to bovine serum fibronectin-coated culture dishes. Control and treated cells were also examined for migration into micropore filters coated with the same protein. Compared with control, MSF-treated melanocytes adhered to the dishes more easily and migrated into the filters in a dose-dependent manner. MSF at a dose of more than 200 μg/ml did not increase melanocyte adhesion and migration accordingly. With the exception of MSF 10 μg/ml, at every concentration of MSF there were significant differences between treated and untreated melanocytes (p < 0.01) when the adhesion test was studied. Regarding migration, even at a concentration of MSF 10 μg/ml, obviously increased cell numbers were found compared with MSF untreated melanocytes (p < 0.01). MSF promoted melanocyte adhesion and migration; this could explain, in part, the capacity of MSF to regulate melanocyte function in vitiligo. © 2004 Prous Science. All rights reserved.

27944477808	Effects of single herbal drugs on adhesion and migration of melanocytes	Objective: To find herbs with effects on adhesion and migration of melanocytes in vitro. Materials and methods: Ethanol extracts from 14 herbs were tested. Normal human melanocytes were obtained from neonatal foreskin, and the 48-well culture dish covered with fibronectin was used for the melanocyte adhesion assay. Motility was assessed by using the micropore filter method. Results: The extracts of Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), Tusizi (Semen Cuscutae) and Honghua (Flos Carthami) could enhance melanocyte adhesion to fibronectin, while Cijili (Fructus Tribuli) and Huangqi (Radix Astragali) promote melanocyte migration in vitro. Buguzhi (Fructus Psoraleae), Nü Zhen Zi (Fructus Ligustri Lucidi) and Baizhi (Radix Angelicae Dahuricae) could promote both adhesion and migration of melanocytes. Conclusion: The above herbs may play a role through promoting adhesion and/or migration of melanocytes in the treatment of vitiligo.

2942555019	Co-patterning chitosan and bovine serum albumin on an aldehyde-enriched glass substrate by microcontact printing	Chitosan and bovine serum albumin were co-patterned onto a glass substrate by microcontact printing technique. The process uses a microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane stamp to transfer chitosan on an aldehyde functionalized glass substrate, followed by adding a drop of albumin solution to the patterned side and holding for 30 min. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cleaned by ultrasonic, the co-patterns of chitosan and albumin, each with their own micropatterns, were formed on the same surface. In this procedure, ultrasonic cleaning takes an important role to obtain clear patterns, whereas the printing/adding sequence has less influence. Moreover, patterns printed could give higher contrast than those assembled from solution. These co-patterns could find applications in cell localization and cell growth guidance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

33645099609	Compression-inhibited pore formation of polyelectrolyte multilayers containing weak polyanions: A scanning force microscopy study	Morphological changes of poly(acrylic acid)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) multilayers induced by low pH were investigated by scanning force microscopy. The weakened interaction between the charged polymer chains in the protonation process is believed to be the reason for this variation. Kinetic studies have shown that during protonation phase separation and dissociation of the multilayers took place successively. The compression of the multilayers, however, caused a transition of the multilayers from a rubbery state to a glassy state. As a result, the closely compacted multilayers lost their sensitivity to pH change. An increase of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, can decrease the free energy of the multilayers, and stabilize the films. By compression of the multilayers with a rubber stamp having geometric patterns, films with spatially localized pores were produced. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

33645357522	Nano-calcium phosphate/PLLA incorporated with bFGF as in situ-transplantable carrier for cartilage regeneration	A novel composite of biodegradable Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) with the deposition of the nanosized amorphous calcium phosphate (NCP) particles was developed as tissue engineering scaffold. To improve the minor intrinsic healing capacity of cartilage tissue, the porous composite with desired degradation rate was incorporated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and evaluated in the in vivo environment. Full-thickness defects were created in the weight-bearing surface of the femoral condyles in a rabbit model. The defect was filled with and without NCP/PLLA scaffold as a carrier of bFGF. Gross morphology for the test implant showed that the defect was filled with regenerated tissue. It resembled cartilaginous tissue and restored the contour of the condyle at 8 weeks after operation. For the untreated control, no cartilage-like tissue was observed at all defects. Histological analysis revealed neochondrogenesis and clusters of cartilaginous extracellular matrix observed with safranin-O staining at 4 weeks for the NCP/PLLA with bFGF treated defects. At 8 weeks after operation, well-formed and mature cartilage was resurfaced the defects. While only fibrous tissue replacement was observed for the control either at 4 or 8 weeks. Special staining for cartilage indicated the presence of highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans and collagen, which were the major extracellular matrices of cartilage. This investigation showed the potential of NCP/PLLA loaded with bFGF in the study of in situ-transplantable carrier to improve healing of cartilage tissue lesion.

33645388644	Biological and biomechanical properties of chemically modified SLA titanium implants in vitro and in vivo	The objective of this study was to evaluate the interface shear strength and the responses of osteoblast-like cells to titanium implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched surface modified by alkali and heat treatments (SLA-AH). The implants with machined and SLA surface served as controls. Each type of implant was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis. In vitro assays were made using human osteoblast-like cell culture on different surfaces. The rectangle plates were also transcortically implanted into the proximal metaphysis of New Zealand White rabbit tibiae. After 4, 8 and 12 weeks implantation, mechanical and histological assessments were performed to evaluate biomechanical and biological behavior in vivo. By SEM examination, SLA surface combined with AH treatments revealed a macro-rough surface with finely microporous structure. The in vitro assays showed that the SLA-AH surfaces exhibited more extensive cell deposition and improved cell proliferation as compared with controls. Pull-out test demonstrated that the SLA-AH treated implants had a higher mechanical strength than the controls at all interval time after implantation. Histologically, the test implants revealed a significantly greater percentage of bone-implant contact when compared with controls. The results of this study suggest that a useful approach by combined processes could optimize implant surfaces for bone deposition and produce distinct biological surface features.

33744481309	Generation and characterization of a transgenic mouse model for pancreatic cancer	Aim: To generate a SV40Tag transgenic tumor animal model and to study the mechanism underlying tumorigenesis. Methods: A mammary gland expres sion vector containing SV40Tag DNA was generated. Transgene fragments were microinjeted into fertilized eggs of FVB mice. The genetically manipulated embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant female mice. PCR and Northern blot analysis were used for genotype analysis of F1 and F2 mice. Transgene expression was detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Results: SV4OTag gene was detected in two lines of transgenic mice. One of them delivered the transgene to F1 and a tumor was found in the pancreas of these mice. PT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that SV4OTag gene was expressed in the tumor. Pathological characterization of the transgenic mice demonstrated that the tumor belonged to pancreatic cystic neoplasm. Conclusion: SV4OTag transgenic mouse model can be successfully established. The transgenic mice develop a pancreatic tumor, which can be used for investigation of the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis in vivo. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

33746585317	Mechanism of receptor for retinoids inducing apoptosis of human melanoma cell line A375	Objective: To investigate the mechanism of receptors for retinoids inducing apoptosis of human melanoma cell line A375. Methods: The effects of 3 kinds of retinoids (9-cis-RA, at-RA and 13-cis-RA), of TTNPB (RAR agonist) and of Methoprene acid (Ma, RXR agonist) on apoptosis of A375 cells were studied by detecting the expression of Bcl-2/Bax and by using. Annexin V/PI staining analysis, TUNEL detection and active Caspase-3 analysis. Results: Retinoids and TTNPB could up-regulate the expression of Bax and down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2. The results of TUNEL and Annexin V/PI staining analysis showed that all of retinoids and TTNPB could induce apoptosis of A375 cells, compared with control group (P < 0.05); the effect of TTNPB was significantly greater than that of others (P < 0.05), but Ma was similar to the control (P > 0.05). Active Caspase-3 analysis showed that TTNPB and all of retinoids could up-regulate the expression of Caspase-3, and the effect of TTNPB was significantly greater than that of others (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Caspase-3 pathway is involved in the process for retinoids inducing apoptosis of A375 cells. The activation of RAR may have relation with retinoids inducing apoptosis of A375 cells, but may have no longer relation with RXR.

The pigs were allocated on the basis of BW and litter to 3 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. There were 3 replicate pens per treatment, and the pigs were grouped with 10 pigs per pen. The dietary treatments were (1) basal diet; (2) basal diet + 20 mg of flavomycin/kg + 110 mg of aureomycin/kg; (3) basal diet + 1.0 g of lactoferrin/kg. Six pigs, randomly selected from each treatment (2 piglets/pen) were slaughtered for intestinal morphology and expression of PR-39 and protegrin-1 genes at the end of the experiment. Supplementation with lactoferrin improved growth performance; it increased ADG by 41.80% (P < 0.01) and efficiency of gain (G:F) by 17.20% (P < 0.05). Intestinal villus height was increased by 15.30% (P < 0.05), and crypt depth was decreased by 9.60% (P < 0.05). Supplemental lactoferrin increased the relative abundance of mRNA for PR-39 and protegrin-1 by 143% (P < 0.01) and 217% (P < 0.01), respectively. The use of lactoferrin as an additive to improve nonspecific immunity and strengthen host defenses would be good a method of defending weaned pigs from infections and weanling stress. ©2006 American Society of Animal Science.

33750430281	Effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on cartilage and synovium of knee joints with osteoarthritis in rabbits	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intra-articular injection of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on cartilage and synovium of knee joints with osteoarthritis (OA) in rabbits and the underlying mechanism. Forty rabbits underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transaction and were divided into two groups. Rabbits were injected with 100 μmol/l DHEA dissolved in the dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) in the knee joints 5 weeks after transaction, once a week for 5 weeks. Rabbits injected with DMSO under the same condition were served as a control. All rabbits were killed 1 week after the last injection. The knee joints were evaluated by gross morphology, histology, and gene expression analysis. Gross morphologic inspection and histological evaluation showed that the DHEA group appeared less damage in cartilage and synovium as compared with the control. Gene expression analysis revealed that the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in cartilage and synovium decreased significantly in the DHEA group and that of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) increased. No significant difference of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) mRNA expression was found in the cartilage between two groups while the mRNA expression of IL-1β in the synovium was largely suppressed in the DHEA group. The study suggests that DHEA plays a protective role against cartilage degradation and synovium inflammation in rabbits with OA. This role may be achieved through the regulation of the MMP-3, TIMP-1, and IL-1β gene expression in the cartilage and synovium. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

33749834039	Evaluation of specific antibodies for early diagnosis and management of syphilis	For many years, tests for cardiolipin antibodies Tp15, Tp17, Tp45, Tp47, and other specific Treponema pallidum antibodies, have been used to diagnose syphilis, but the timing and rates of antibody detection differ in primary and secondary syphilis. Our objective was to determine the value of the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, T. pallidum passive particle agglutination (TPPA) assay and Western blotting (WB) in the diagnosis of early syphilis, by studying 67 patients (20 with primary and 47 with secondary syphilis) over a recent 5-year period. All patients were tested before and 21/67 were tested after treatment. Western blotting showed that while there was a difference within the study group in terms of the number of bands detected, all patients with primary syphilis demonstrated the 47-kDa antibody, but RPR and TPPA were negative in some patients. Eighteen to 24.months after treatment, 21/67 patients were tested by WB and TPPA; antibodies to T. pallidum became undetectable within 24.months after treatment in 29% of patients. By RPR, 29% patients had negative titers within 6.months of treatment, and 86% returned to normal within 24.months. We conclude that detection of specific 47-kDa T. pallidum antibodies can be used to diagnose primary syphilis. By RPR, antibodies disappear in 6-24.months after treatment in many patients, suggesting that a change in titer may be an indicator of treatment success. © 2006 The International Society of Dermatology.

33846443697	Effects of endothelin-1 on melanocyte adhesion and migration	Objective To investigate the effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the adhesion and migration of melanocyte in vitro. Methods Human epidermal melanocytes that had been cultured and purified were treated with ET-I and observed for adhesion to bovine serumfibronectin-coated culture dishes. Stem cell factor (SCF) and ET-1 treated cells were also examined for migration into micropore filters coated with the same protein. Results Gompared with the SCF group , ET-1 treated melanocytes were easier to adhere to the dishes and to be moved into the filters , especially when the concentration was 32 nmol/L. When the concentration of ET-I was 128 nmol/L or more , it could inhibit the adhesion and migration of melanocyte. At any concentration of ET-I except at 2 nmol/L , there was a significant difference between ET-I-treated and untreated melanocytes (P <0. 01) when the adhesion test was carried out. However, even at 2 nmol/L ET-I , there was obviously increased migration compared with those of ET-I untreated melanocytes and SCF-lrealcd cells (<().01). Conclusion ET-1 may influence the adhesion and migration of melanocyte . which can partly explain the capacity of ET-1 to regulate the melanocyte function in vitiligo lesions. ©1994-2010 China Academic Journal Electronic Publishing House, All rights reserved.

33846672735	Effect of dietary bovine lactoferrin on lipid peroxidation and activities, and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes of piglets	The experiment was conducted to evaluate effect of dietary bovine lactoferrin (bLF) on lipid peroxidation and activities as well as mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes of piglets. Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred female piglets (n=120, 35 days of age, liveweight 9.70±0.71 kg) were fed a diet containing 0, 1250, or 2500 mg/kg bLF for 30 days. After completion of the feeding experiment, twelve female piglets with 4 animals in each treatment were randomly selected to determine malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) levelsczinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), glutathione perioxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) activities in serum and liver, and CuZnSOD, GPx and CAT mRNA levels in liver. Results showed that piglets treated with 2500 mg/kg bLF significantly increased (P<0.05) TAOC levels, the activities of GPx, CuZnSOD and CAT, and mRNA levels of CuZnSOD, GPx and CAT, and decreased (P<0.05) the contents of MDA as compared with control. Supplementation with 1250 mg/kg bLF also increased (P<0.05) the activities of CuZnSOD, GPx and CAT and mRNA levels of GPx and CAT, and decreased (P<0.05) the contents of MDA as compared with control, but the effect was not better than that of dietary addition of 2500 mg/kg bLF (P<0.05). The study indicated that addition of bLF improved the antioxidant function of piglets by up-regulation of mRNA levels and activities of certain antioxidant enzymes associated with free radicals metabolism.

Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire young growing pigs (n=90, female, 60 days of age, liveweight 21.88 ± 1.26 kg) were randomly allocated to three treatments. Each treatment had three replicates with ten pigs per pen. The basal diets were not supplemented or supplemented (5 g/kg) with 80 mesh Astragalus (180 urn), or micron Astragalus (6.32 μm), respectively; the feeding experiment lasted 30 days. After completion of the feeding experiment, three animals from each treatment were chosen to determine the effect of Astragalus on immune function. Results showed that supplementation with micron Astragalus significantly increased (P<0.05) average daily gain (ADG), both Concanavalin (ConA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced splenocyte and peripheral lymphocyte proliferation, and significantly increased (P<0.05) serum IgG, IgA, IL-1α and IL-2 concentrations compared with the control groups. Supplementation with 80 mesh Astragalus only increased (P<0.05) serum IgA, IL-1α and IL-2 concentrations compared with control. The results indicated that micron Astragalus was more effective than 80 mesh Astragalus in improving growth performance and enhancing immune function of pigs.

33846709918	Developmental expression of the lipoprotein lipase gene in porcine subcutaneous adipose tissue	Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has been implicated as a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. The pattern of LPL gene expression in different ages and its relation to adipose deposition was studied. Fifteen female Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire pigs aged at 1 day, 7, 14, 21 and 28 weeks (three pigs per age, 10% per each bred) were used to study developmental gene expression of LPL in subcutaneous adipose tissue by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the LPL mRNA levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue significantly increased from 1 day to 7 weeks (P<0.01), and then gradually decreased from 7 to 28 weeks. A strong inverse correlation between LPL mRNA levels and age as well as adipose index and body weight was found between 7 and 28 weeks. Body weight and total adipose weight increased significantly with age (P<0.01).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this scaffold combined with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to repair articular cartilage defects in a rabbit model. Forty-two osteochondral defects created in the femoral condyles were (a) left untreated, (b) treated by PLLA combined with bFGF, or (c) ACP/PLLA loaded with bFGF. The treatment of PLLA incorporated with bFGF improved defect filling compared with that left untreated, while the regenerated tissue was mainly fibrocartilage and showed little bone formation with only a small amount of collagen type II (Col II) and no aggrecan gene message measured. When implanted with ACP/PLLA and bFGF, most of the defects were filled with a well-established layer of cartilage tissue with abundance of cartilaginous extracellular matrix accumulation observed. Positive immunohistochemical staining of Col II was observed. High levels of Col II and aggrecan message were also detected by RT-PCR. These results indicate the feasibility of using the combination of ACP/PLLA with bFGF for cartilage repair. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34047260092	Developmental gene expression of antimicrobial peptide Protegrin-1 and effect of weaning on gene regulation of Protegrin-1 in piglets	Two experiments were conducted to evaluate developmental gene expression of antimicrobial peptide Protegrin-1 and effect of weaning on gene regulation of Protegrin-1 in piglets using semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. In experiment 1, total 15 female 28 day-age weanling Duroc x Landracex Yorkshire piglets were divided into three groups. And 5 piglets in each group were slaughtered at 1,14,28,42 and 56 day-age respectively, which were used to determine mRNA expression of Protegrin-1 at different ages. In experiment 2, 18 neonatal female piglets, divided into three groups (6 piglets of each group), were weaned at 21, 28 and 35 days of age, respectively. At the 21, 28 and 35 day-age before weaned, 3 piglets in each group were slaughtered, and bone marrow cells of piglets were sampled. Furthermore, additional 3 piglets in each group were slaughtered and sampling in 7 days after they were weaned. The samples were collected for detecting the effect of weaning on Protegrin-1 mRNA expression of piglets. The current results show that Protegrin-1 mRNA levels increased steadily in postnatal 1-28 day-age (pre-weaning). But after the piglets were weaned at 28 day-age, the levels of Protegrin-1 gene expression were decreased markedly (P<0.05) from 28 to 42 day-age (14 days after weaning). From 42 days to 56 days, its expression levels were increased again. The results of experiment 2 showed that when the piglets were weaned at 21 days of age, the expression levels of Protegrin-1 were decreased by 34% at the seventh day after weaning; when the piglets were weaned at 28 days of age, the expression levels of Protegrin-1 were decreased by 51% at the seventh day after weaning; when the piglets were weaned at 35 days of age, the expression levels of Protegrin-1 were decreased by 49% at the seventh day after weaning. Our results showed that weaning significantly decreased Protegrin-1 mRNA expression of piglets.

34447285243	Increase of firing rate with changes in firing pattern of neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus in 6-hydrodopamine lesioned rats	Objective: To explore the change in the firing rate and firing pattern of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) neurons in 6-hydrodopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally lesiond rats. Methods: Electrophysiological recordings of PPN neurons were done in normal rats and 6-OHDA lesiond rats with standard single unit glass microelectrode method in vivo. Results: The firing rate of PPN neurons in normal rats and 6-OHDA lesiond rats were (9.0 ± 0.8) Hz [(0.5-25.2) Hz, n = 56] and (16.1 ± 1.6) Hz [(1.2-49.7) Hz, n = 57), respectively. The firing rate of 6-OHDA lesioned rats was significantly increased when compared to control rats (P < 0.001). Concerning the firing pattern, 68% (38/56) of the neurons recorded discharged regularly, 27% (15/56) exhibited an irregular pattern and 5% (3/56) discharged in bursts in normal rats. In 6-OHDA lesioned rats, 39% (22/57) discharged regularly, 47% (27/57) exhibited an irregular pattern and 14% (8/57) in bursts. The number of PPN neurons in 6-OHDA lesioned rats fired irregularly was significantly higher than in control rats (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The firing rate and the percentage of the irregularly firing neuron in PPN of 6-OHDA lesioned rats increased significantly, which may be contributed to the pathophysiological changes of Parkinson's disease.

34447523346	Crystal structures and site-directed mutagenesis of a mycothiol-dependent enzyme reveal a novel folding and molecular basis for mycothiol-mediated maleylpyruvate isomerization	Mycothiol (MSH) is the major low molecular mass thiols in many Gram-positive bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium glutamicum. The physiological roles of MSH are believed to be equivalent to those of GSH in Gramnegative bacteria, but current knowledge of MSH is limited to detoxification of alkalating chemicals and protection from host cell defense/killing systems. Recently, an MSH-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase (MDMPI) was discovered from C. glutamicum, and this isomerase represents one example of many putative MSH-dependent enzymes that take MSH as cofactor. In this report, fourteen mutants of MDMPI were generated. The wild type and mutant (H52A) MDMPIs were crystallized and their structures were solved at 1.75 and 2.05 Å resolution, respectively. The crystal structures reveal that this enzyme contains a divalent metal-binding domain and a C-terminal domain possessing a novel folding pattern (αβαββα fold). The divalent metal-binding site is composed of residues His

34447108737	Caspase-8 dependent osteosarcoma cell apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitor MG132	Many researchers have reported that proteasome inhibitors could induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, such as breast cancer cell, lung cancer cell, and lymphoma cell. However, the effect of proteasome inhibitors on osteocsarcoma cells and the mechanisms are seldom studied. In this study, we found proteasome inhibitor MG132 was an effective inducer of apoptosis in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. On normal human diploid fibroblast cells, MG132 did not show any apoptosis-inducing effects. Apoptotic changes such as DNA fragment and apoptotic body were observed in MG132-treated cells and MG132 mostly caused MG-63 cell arrest at G

34547799268	Generation and characterization of islet cell tumor in pTet-on/pTRE-SV40Tag double-transgenic mice model	A line of double-transgenic mice that develop neoplasms arising primarily in the pancreas was established. In these mice, the oncogene SV40 T antigen (Tag) was detected in the pancreas with and without the control of Tet-on system. The transgenic mice that developed pancreatic tumors as early as 20 weeks of age showed hypoglycemia on a blood glucose test. Pathological and immunohistochemical characterizations demonstrated that the tumors belonged to neuroendocrine neoplasms arising from pancreatic islets. A change in IGFs/IGF-1R signaling pathway was detected using real-time PCR analysis. A potential association between the IGFs/IGF-1R system and SV40Tag was studied to further explain the cancerogenesis of the double-transgenic mice by Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments. The results suggest that a Tag transgenic mice model could be used to study the molecular mechanism of the tumorigenesis of islets. © 2007 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

34547905758	Rings of hydrogel fabricated by a micro-transfer technique	Microgel rings have been fabricated on a glass surface by a micro-transfer technique. The polymer melt is transferred to the substrate surface in a confined space with a picoliter volume along the boundary of the polymeric stamp. The surface of the polymer features is smoothenedby surface tension in an annealing cycle, which results in isotropic rings. After cross-linking, the microgels respond swiftly when immersed in water. Asymmetric rings are also obtained by tilting the substrate. The microgels can detach from the substrate to form a suspension of the rings. Conjugated rings have also been fabricated by supplementing functional molecules into the poly(ethylene glycol) network. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,.

Methods: Scleroderma was induced in BALB/c mice by daily local injection of bleomycin for three weeks and the mice were randomly divided into untreated, WYCBD-treated and normal saline (NS) treated groups, with another group of BALB/c mice as normal control. WYCBD and NS were given orally for one month respectively. Histopathology in the skin and lungs of the mice were examined. The CTGF and COL- I expressions in the skin or skin lesions were detected by immunohistochemical Elivision assay. Results: The expression levels of CTGF and COL- I in the untreated group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (P<0.05). Compared with the NS-treated group, the WYCBD-treated group had significant improvement in the skin and lung histopathology and remarkably decreased expression levels of CTGF and COL- I (P<0.05). Conclusion: Scleroderma mice showed high expressions of CTGF and COL- I in the skin. WYCBD had the effects of decreasing the CTGF and COL- I expressions and improving the skin fibrosis.

36448941863	Stimulating effect of silica-containing nanospheres on proliferation of osteoblast-like cells	Silica and silica-based materials have been found widespread application for medical purposes, especially in the fields of bone tissue engineer. Nano-sized silica has been developed too and been considered to be used in bone regeneration. In this study, we observed the biological response of osteoblast-like cells to three kinds of silica nanospheres: SNs-A (30-40 nm), SNs-B (70-80 nm), and Silica/OCP (70-80 nm). Cells treated with three kinds of nanospheres always showed higher cell viability than control cells. ALP activity of cells treated with three kinds of silica nanospheres was higher than that of control cells at early time. Both of the two effects were not in a concentration-dependent manner. Silica/OCP had better effect on MG-63 cell activity and proliferation than SNs-A and SNs-B. The three kinds of silica nano material all have biological validity on osteoblast-like cells, especially Silica/OCP. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

36048941356	Effects of dietary copper (II) sulfate and copper proteinate on performance and blood indexes of copper status in growing pigs	160 crossbred (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) gilts averaged 21.25 kg body weight were used to study the effects of dietary copper (II) sulfate (CuSO4) and copper proteinate (Cu-Pr) on growth performance, plasma Cu concentration, ceruloplasmin activity, and erythrocyte Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. All pigs were allotted to four treatments and fed with basal diets supplemented with 0 (control), 250 mg /kg Cu as CuSO4, and 50 and 100 mg/kg Cu as Cu-Pr. Growth performance was determined based on two growth phase (phase 1: days 0 to 15, phase 2: days 15 to 30). After 30 days of the treatment, 16 pig blood samples (four per treatment) were collected for indexes of copper status determination. The experimental results showed that compared with control, pigs fed with 250 mg Cu/kg as CuSO4 and 100 mg Cu/kg as Cu-Pr had higher average daily gain and average daily feed intake in the whole growth phase (d 0 to 30). In addition, 250 mg Cu/kg as CuSO4 and 100 mg/kg Cu as Cu-Pr enhanced plasma ceruloplasmin activity (P<0.05), and 100 mg/kg Cu as Cu-Pr increased erythrocyte Cu/Zn-SOD activity (P<0.01) compared with the control. There was no obvious treatment response on plasma Cu concentration in the present study. © Humana Press Inc. 2007.

36749066515	The construction of the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/azurin and the increased apoptosis of U2OS cells transfected with IT	In our previous study, we demonstrated that azurin could selectively trigger apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS cells. However, the rate of apoptosis (35.8 ± 3.2%) is not very high, and azurin is too expensive to obtain readily. To solve these problems, we constructed a eukaryotic expression plasmid containing the azurin gene with an influenza virus haemagglutinin 9 peptide HA epitope tag, and transfected the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)/azurin into U2OS cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis validated the successful transfection and the expression of the azurin-HA protein. Conspicuous apoptosis of the transfected cells was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) and the DNA ladder test. The apoptosis rate reached 64.3 ± 13.1%. The transcriptional levels of the Bax and p53 genes increased significantly in U2OS cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)/azurin, but the Bcl-2 mRNA level decreased. There was no difference in the levels of Bcl-xl mRNA and Survivin mRNA. We propose that the transfection of the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)/azurin can significantly induce apoptosis in U2OS cells. This is closely associated with the up-regulation of the transcriptional level of the Bax and p53 genes, and the down-regulation of that of the Bcl-2 gene. © 2007 by the University of Wrocław.

37649015896	Effect of dietary bovine lactoferrin on performance and antioxidant status of piglets	The experiment investigated the effect of dietary bovine lactoferrin (bLF) on growth performance and antioxidant systems of piglets. Duroc-Landrace-Yorkshire crossbred female piglets (n = 120, 35 days of age, live-weight 9.70 ± 0.71 kg) were fed a diet containing 0, 1250 or 2500 mg/kg bLF for 30 days. After completion of the feeding experiment, eight animals from each treatment were randomly selected to determine malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) activities in serum and longissimus muscle, and CuZnSOD, GPx and CAT mRNA levels in longissimus muscle. Results showed that supplementation with bLF improved average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and reduced diarrhea ratios of piglets with the linear and quadratic polynomial contrasts being significant (P<0.01). The highest weight gain and the best feed conversion occurred at 2500 mg/kg bLF. Serum and longissimus muscle CuZnSOD and GPx, and serum TAOC linearly and quadraticly increased (P<0.01), serum CAT and longissimus muscle CAT and TAOC linearly increased (P<0.01), whereas MDA concentrations in serum and longissimus muscle linearly decreased (P<0.01) as dietary bLF supplementation increased. Increasing dietary bLF levels improved (P<0.01) mRNA expression of CuZnSOD and CAT in longissimus muscle of piglets. The results indicated that exogenous antioxidant bLF was effective in improving growth performance and enhancing antioxidant enzymes activity and mRNA levels of piglets. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

39049098297	Involvement of insulin-like growth factor-insulin receptor signal pathway in the transgenic mouse model of medulloblastoma	A transgenic mouse model expressing Simian virus 40 T-antigen (SV40Tag) under the control of a tetracycline system was generated. In this model, a cerebellar tumor was developed after doxycycline hydrochloride treatment. Real time-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry results indicated that the SV40Tag gene was expressed in the tumor. Pathological analysis showed that the tumor belonged to medulloblastoma. Further molecular characterization of the tumor demonstrated that the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway was activated. We also found that the SV40Tag could bind and translocate insulin receptor substrate 1 into the nucleus in primary cultured tumor cells. The interaction between the IGF pathway and SV40Tag may contribute to the process of malignant transformation in medulloblastoma. This transgenic animal model provides an important tool for studies on the signal pathways involved in the preneoplastic process in medulloblastoma and could help to identify therapeutic targets for brain tumors. © 2008 Japanese Cancer Association.

3342969613	A novel process for inking the stamp with biomacromolecule solution used in reactive microcontact printing	This paper describes a novel process for inking the stamp with biomacromolecule solution used in reactive microcontact printing. The stamp was first coated with biomacromolecule solution such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution for 20 min, and then dried by soft nitrogen flow. After cooling the stamp below the dew point for 1 min and incubated at room temperature for 10 s, a thin layer of condensed water was formed on the stamp surface. Then, an aldehyde functionalized glass slide was pressed immediately onto the stamp for certain time, yielding the covalently patterning of the biomacromolecules on the aldehyde-containing surface. A notable feature of this process is that the biomacromolecule solution can be inked onto the stamp at a controlled state, neither too "dry" nor too "wet". As a result, the covalently grafting reaction can occur at a comparable speed with those in solution, while avoiding the contamination caused by dispersal of excessive solvent. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

3343022067	The effect of betaine and DL-methionine on growth performance and carcass characteristics in meat ducks	An experiment was conducted with meat ducks to determine if betaine could replace methionine in a methionine-deficient diet. In order to avoid the effects of betaine as a methyl-group donor or as an osmoprotectant or coccidiostat enhancer, sufficient amounts of methyl-donating compounds were added and clean conditions were used to reduce the coccidiosis challenge. A total of 576-day-old female meat ducks were fed one of four diets in a 2 (0 and 0.5 g betaine/kg) × 2 (0, 1.2 g DL-methionine/kg) factorial arrangement between 0 and 41 days of age. The basal diet contained 3.5 g methionine/kg (0-21 days), 3.0 g methionine/kg (21-38 days) and 3.0 g methionine/kg (38-41 days), respectively, and 3.4 g cystine/kg (0-21 days), 3.3 g cystine/kg (21-38 days) and 3.4 g cystine/kg (38-41 days). There were six replicates of 24 ducks per treatment. Performance was determined at 21 and 42 days. At the end, carcass yields, breast yields and abdominal fat were determined on nine ducks per replicate. There were no significant interactions between betaine and DL-methionine. DL-Methionine improved (P < 0.01) body weight and feed to gain at 21 days, and improved (P < 0.05) body weight at 41 days. The effect of betaine were also significant (P < 0.01) in term of bodyweight at 21 days and feed to gain. Betaine supplementation significantly decreased abdominal fat (P < 0.001) and increased breast yield (P < 0.01). Although there was a marked and significant response to methionine supplementation (1.2 g DL-methionine/kg) in breast yield (P < 0.01), the effect of methionine supplementation was not significant on abdominal fat (P > 0.05). These results suggest that betaine is more effective in improving carcass quality than methionine, and also effective in promoting growth and feed efficiency of starter ducks, provided the dietary levels of methionine are not marginally limiting. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Using the pBC-SV40Tag transgenic mice model of pancreatic cystic neoplasm, we studied the gene expression changes by applying high-density microarrays. Validation of part gene expression profiling data was performed using real-time PCR. Results: By using high-density oligonucleotide microarray, of 14113 genes, 453 were increased and 760 decreased in pancreatic cystic neoplasm, including oncogenes, cell-cycle-related genes, signal transduction-related genes, skeleton-related genes and metabolism-related genes. Among these, we confirmed the changes in Igf, Shh and Wnt signal pathways with real-time PCR. The results of real-time PCR showed similar expression changes in gene chip. Conclusion: all the altered expression genes are associated with cell cycle, DNA damage and repair, signal pathway, and metabolism. SV4OTag may cooperate with several proteins in promoting tumorigenesis. © 2007 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

34249863332	Postnatal expression pattern of adipose type fatty acid binding protein in different adipose tissues of porcine	Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP), which belongs to the FABP family, plays an essential role in longchain fatty acid uptake and metabolic homeostasis, especially in adipose tissue. The pattern of A-FABP gene mRNA expression in different growth stages and its relation to intramuscular fat (IMF) accretion in pigs was studied. Fifteen female Durocx LandracexYorkshire pigs in five groups of three pigs each, weighing 1, 30, 50, 70 and 90 kg were used to study developmental gene mRNA expression of A-FABP in various adipose tissues by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that A-FABP mRNA levels in subcutaneous and ventral adipose tissues first increased from 1 to 50 kg, then gradually declined from 50 to 90 kg. Moreover, the rank order of A-FABP mRNA levels determined in three adipose tissues was as follows: subcutaneous adipose>ventral adipose>mesenteric adipose. A-FABP mRNA expression in mesenteric adipose tissue was constant during development. In addition, a positive correlation from 1 to 50 kg BW pigs and a negative correlation from 50 to 90 kg BW between A-FABP mRNA levels in subcutaneous and ventral adipose and IMF content were found.

34247526453	5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine lesion of the dorsal raphe nucleus alters neuronal activity of the subthalamic nucleus in normal and 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats	The subthalamic nucleus receives serotonergic projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus. However, the role of serotonergic innervation in the activity of subthalamic neurons in vivo is unknown. The aim of the present work is to study the changes in the firing of subthalamic neurons in rats with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus and rats with combined 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions in the dorsal raphe nucleus and 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta by using single-unit extracellular recordings. In rats with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus, the firing rate of subthalamic neurons increased significantly compared with normal rats and the firing pattern changed significantly towards a more bursting firing in the majority of the neurons observed. In rats with combined dorsal raphe nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta lesions, the firing rate and firing pattern of subthalamic neurons did not show a significant difference compared to rats with lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, dorsal raphe nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta lesions combined increased significantly the percentage of subthalamic neurons with burst-firing pattern compared to normal rats, while having no effect on their firing rate. These results show that the serotonergic efferent projections of the dorsal raphe nucleus significantly influence on the activity of subthalamic neurons and that the loss of dopaminergic projection by substantia nigra pars compacta lesion decreases the effect of the lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus on subthalamic nucleus neuronal activity, suggesting that the role of the dorsal raphe nucleus may be exerted by the dorsal raphe nucleus-substantia nigra pars compacta-subthalamic nucleus pathway. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

34247567788	Effects of the lactoferrin (LF) on the growth performance, intestinal microflora and morphology of weanling pigs	A total of 90 weanling pigs (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) at an average initial body weight of 6.1 ± 0.8 kg were used in a 30-day growth trial to investigate the effect of lactoferrin on growth performance, on intestinal microflora and on intestinal morphology. The pigs were allocated on the basis of weight and litter to three dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. There were three replicate pens per treatment and pigs were grouped with 10 pigs per pen. The dietary treatments were: (1) basal diet, (2) basal diet + 20 mg/kg flavomycin + 110 mg/kg aureomycin, and (3) basal diet + 1.0 g/kg lactoferrin. Six randomly selected pigs from each treatment (two piglets per pen) were slaughtered for the intestinal microflora and intestinal morphology at the end of the experiment. Supplementation with LF improved growth performance, significantly increased the ADG by 34.0% (P<0.01) and ADFI by 17.0% (P<0.05), decreased the F/G by 12.8% (P<0.05) and the diarrhea by 66.2% (P<0.05). Reducing the total viable counts of Escherichia coli and Salmonella (P<0.05), enriched the colonic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (P<0.05) in the small intestine. The villus height was increased (P<0.01) and crypt depth decreased (P<0.05) at the small intestinal mucosa as compared with the control. Supplemental antibiotic also increased ADG and ADFI (P<0.05), decreased diarrhea (P<0.05) and reduced the total viable counts of some pathogenic bacteria (P<0.05), but not significantly affected beneficial bacteria and intestinal morphology. The use of lactoferrin as an additive to improve growth performance, prevent diarrhea, and affect on the intestinal microflora and morphology of weanling pigs would be good a method of defending weaned pigs from infections and weanling stress. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34249044161	The osteogenic potential of stem cell- and BMP2 gene-activating bioceramic in vivo	Stimulation of bone healing through local application of growth factors from implants may improve the clinical outcome in fracture treatments. However, the growth factors in reconstructive application require supraphysiologic dosing and considerable expense while hampering their clinical application. Genetic modification of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to both produce and respond to osteogenic factors may have potential for use in enhancing bone healing. In this study, MSCs were genetically modified by a recombinant adenoviral containing the gene for human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP-2). The gene-transduced cells were incorporated with a porous beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) as a novel complex. We investigated osteogeneic potential of gene-transduced MSCs/ceramic and the ability of the complex on facilitating bone formation in a radius segmental defect of rabbits. In vitro results showed that there were apparent hBMP2 gene expression and protein synthesis in MSCs with hBMP2 stably transfection, whereas negative expression of hBMP2 in controls. Histological studies demonstrated that gene-transfected MSCs/ceramic composite appeared an ability of heterotopic osteogenesis. In the segmental bone defects, endochondrial ossification at fracture sites was found in both transfected and untransfected MSCs-ceramic composites. While the composite with hBMP2 transfection showed the earliest and the most effective healing of the segmental bone defects both radiographically and morphologically. Our results show that genetically modified MSCs/ceramics had enhanced osteogeneic capacity relative to unmodified MSCs or only ceramic implants. This study suggests that use of cell-and gene-activated bioceramics may offer promise for molecular design of implants to induce osteogenesis and enhance bone regeneration.

34249104502	Comparison of age-related differences in expression of antioxidant enzyme mRNA and activity in various tissues of pigs	Antioxidant enzymes (AOEs), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase(SOD) and catalase (CAT) play an important role in protecting tissues from reactive oxygen species (ROS) reactions. The objective of this study was to determine the developmental regulation of AOEs mRNA levels and activity in tissues of different growing phases pigs (Sus scrofa). Nine different tissues were collected from thirty Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire male pigs with six animals in each age (1, 42, 84, 126 and 168 days) to assay for GPx, CAT and CuZnSOD mRNA expression and activities. Results showed that GPx, CAT, and CuZnSOD mRNA levels in liver increased (P < 0.05) at the first stage, and thereafter their levels began to decline (P < 0.05), and the maximal mRNA levels of these AOEs were seen at the age of 42, 84, and 126 days, respectively. In Muscle, GPx and CAT mRNA level increased from 1 to 84 days and 1 to 126 days, respectively, and thereafter their levels began to decline, whereas CuZnSOD mRNA level steadily increased (P < 0.05) following birth. Activity expression of AOEs in selected tissues was increased as pigs became older (P < 0.05) with the exception of CuZnSOD activity in muscle, but changes in AOEs mRNA levels between ages did not fully account for all changes in activity. GPx and CuZnSOD mRNA were most abundantly expressed in muscle, while CAT mRNA were most abundant in brain. AOEs may exert cell and tissue-specific roles in metabolic regulation beyond their mere antioxidant potential. In conclusion, expression of AOEs mRNA and activity exhibit different developmental profiles in various tissues of pigs, and the regulation of AOEs is not tightly coordinated in either tissue. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

58149389325	Rat cartilage repair using nanophase PLGA/HA composite and mesenchymal stem cells	Biodegradable polymer/bioceramic composite poly(lactide- coglycolide)/hydroxyapatite(PLGA/HA) was studied for bone tissue engineering. The PLGA/HA composite was evaluated as a scaffold with the ability for mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to participate in cartilage repair. The PLGA/HA composite and the PLGA/HA composite cultured with MSC were transplanted into cartilage defects created in rats. The PLGA/HA-MSC and PLGA/HA had better tissue morphology, structure integrity, matrix staining, and much thicker newly formed cartilage than the control group. The histological score for PLGA/ HA-MSC better than that for PLGA/HA; it appears that the MSC plays an important role in tissue repair. Based on these results, using PLGA/HA as the tissue scaffold and the addition of MSC significantly enhances cartilage repair. © SAGE Publications 2009.

60549106892	A simple disc degeneration model induced by percutaneous needle puncture in the rat tail	Study Design. We evaluated the degenerative changes to rat tail vertebral discs induced by percutaneous needle puncture, and we compared 2 puncture styles for the depth of needle puncture and the rate of disc degeneration. Objective. To develop a simple animal model of disc degeneration. Summary of Background Data. The study of biologically based treatments for degenerative disc disease depends largely on animal models. Annulus needle puncture in the lumbar spine inducing disc degeneration in rabbits has proven successful, but a similar method has not been evaluated in the tail discs of rats, even though it might produce a desirable model for disc repair studies. Methods. Two consecutive rat tail vertebral discs, proximal and distal to the eighth coccygeal vertebra, were randomized for injury and control. The disc selected for injury was punctured percutaneously using a 20-gauge needle with either full penetration or half penetration. The discs were harvested 1, 2, and 4 weeks later. Measurements included disc height on molybdenum target digital radiographs, biochemistry (water content, glycosaminoglycans, and hydroxyproline), and histology. RESULTS. Needle punctures with full or half penetration caused significant disc space narrowing and progressive histologic changes of degeneration as early as 1 and 2 weeks after injury, respectively. Significant decrease in glycosaminoglycan content was observed at 4 weeks in the half-penetration puncture discs and at 2 and 4 weeks in discs punctured penetratively. Penetrative puncture resulted in a faster decrease in disc height, lower glycosaminoglycan content, and higher grades of histologic degeneration. The water and hydroxyproline content of the discs did not change appreciably. Conclusion. Tail disc percutaneous needle puncture is a simple method for inducing disc degeneration and the rate of degeneration is positively related to the depth of needle puncture. This model still has some limitations that should be taken into consideration when results of disc regeneration research in this model are interpreted and extrapolated to human. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77954750705	Effect of acitretin on IFN-γ mRNA and IL-4 mRNA expressions in the skin lesions of psoriatic vulgaris	Objective: To explore the therapeutic mechanism of acitretin for psoriatic vulgaris (PV). Methods: The clinical effects of acitretin on 30 patients with PV were observed, and the IFN-γ mRNA/IL-4 mRNA expression in PV patients' skin lesions before and after the treatment was detected by hybrization in situ method. Results: The skin inflammation of PV patients was greatly improved with a total efficiency of 76.67%. The expression of IFN-γ mRNA/IL-4 mRNA was detected principally in the lymphocytes at dermoepidermal junction. Prior to the treatment, the expression of IFN-γ mRNA (4.40±1.20) was significantly higher than that in the healthy controls (4.40±1.20) (P<0.01). After the treatment, the expression of IFN-γ mRNA (16.82±7.20) was decreased significantly (P<0.01), but that of IL-4 mRNA did not change significantly. Conclusion: The therapeutic effects of acitretin may be associated with the inhibition of IFN-γ mRNA expression and regulation of dermal Th balance.

79951995407	Effect of reactive gas on micro-mechanical properties in nanocrystalline diamond film	In this paper, nanocrystalline diamond films were prepared by using CH4/H2, CH4/H2/Ar with different concentration in electron enhanced hot filament chemical vapor deposition ( HFCVD) system. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM) as well as Raman scattering spectra were employed to characterize the as-grown films. The micro-mechanical properties were measured by nano-indentation method. The uploading and downloading curves and the variety of hardness and Young's modulus with indentation depth were gained. The results showed that diamond film had a special nano-scaled structure . The higher the CH4 and Ar gas concentration , the finer the grain size and the lower the surface roughness. The nanocrystalline diamond films deposited without Ar gas have a favorable elasticity restoring capacity and a higher average hardness and Young' s modulus. With lower CH, and Ar gas concentration, the average hardness and Young' s modulus of the films got higher.

43849106469	Celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, induces apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 via down-regulation of PI3K/Akt	Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), involved in the inhibition of apoptosis and, the potentiation of cell growth, is frequently overexpressed in human malignancies including osteosarcoma (OS). We have attempted to identify the anti-proliferation of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and the combination of celecoxib and cisplatin in MG-63 cells, and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms involved. MG-63 cells were treated with the combination of celecoxib and cisplatin or either agent alone for 48 h in serum-supplemented medium. Celecoxib caused G1 phase arrest and significantly inhibited cell growth, as well as potentiating cisplatin-induced apoptosis. The effect was dose-dependent, and apoptotic changes such as DNA fragments and apoptotic bodies were observed. However, downregulation of COX-2 did not occur in cells treated with celecoxib. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, survivin, bcl-2 were significantly downregulated in cells treated with the combination of celecoxib and cisplatin, and decreased survivin and bcl-2 levels were found in cells with wortmannin, a specific PI3K inhibitor. Moreover, the decreased expressions of procaspase-9, procaspase-3 and cleaved PARP-1 were detected by Western blot analysis. Therefore, celecoxib exerts its anti-tumor activities through COX-2-independent mechanisms, which may be PI3K/Akt-dependent, and survivin and bcl-2-related. PI3K may be at the center of the celecoxib effects, which play an essential role in the regulation of survivin and Bcl-2. © 2007 International Federation for Cell Biology.

44349145069	The role of interleukin-8 produced by tumor induced fibroblasts in the development of cutaneous melanoma	Objective: To determine the role of interleukin-8 (IL-8) produced by tumor induced fibroblasts in the development of cutaneous melanoma. Methods: B16 melanoma cells induced L929 fibroblasts phenotype was transdifferentiated to myofibroblasts (MF) by co-culture in vitro. MF was monitored by morphology and immunophenotype for a-SMA. The level of IL-8 was detected by ELISA. The effect on B16 cell proliferation rate was estimated using MTT method in vitro. Melanoma implanting model was constructed in C57 mice. Results: L929 MF phenotype could be modulated by B16 melanoma cells-derived transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and elevated the levels of IL-8. L929 MF did not influence the B16 melanoma cells viability in vitro, but shortened the time of tumor formation and increased the incidence rates of tumors in C57 implanting model mice. Conclusion: Fibroblasts can be activated by tumor cells and produce IL-8, which acts as an inflammatory cytokine promoting the development of cutaneous melanoma.

4644335771	A new mutation in the linker 12 domain of keratin 5 in a Chinese family with Weber-Cockayne epidermolysis bullosa simplex	A previously undescribed missense mutation was detected in the L12 domain of keratin 5 (K5) in a Chinese family with Weber-Cockayne epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Direct sequencing of the PCR products identified a single base substitution (983A → G) that changes the aspartic acid residue at codon 328 to glycine in all affected family members, while no mutation was observed either in the healthy individual or 50 unrelated control samples. Asp328 of K5 is remarkably conserved among all type II keratins. D328G is the fourth mutation found to affect this residue in K5-related epidermolysis bullosa simplex, indicating the importance of Asp328 for K5 structure and the dramatic effect that fine changes can have on keratin intermediate filament integrity.

45749094205	Effects of metabolites of the lignans enterolactone and enterodiol on osteoblastic differentiation of MG-63 cells	Plant lignans are converted by the intestinal microflora to the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone, which are associated with beneficial health effects in humans. The mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone are believed to protect against certain diseases, e.g., breast and prostate cancer as well as coronary heart disease. In this study, the effects of enterodiol and enterolactone on osteoblastic differentiation were examined. It was found that enterolactone and enterodiol showed the same effects. They have biphasic effects on cell viability, alkaline phosphotase (ALP) activity, transcriptional level of osteonectin, and collagen I, showing induction at low doses and inhibition at high doses. They increased transcriptional levels of ALP, osteopontin, and osteocalcin in a dose-dependent manner. The difference may be related to the estrogenic and antiestrogenic character and multiple signaling transduction of phytoestrogen. © 2008 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

49749111528	Porcine adipose triglyceride lipase complementary deoxyribonucleic acid clone, expression pattern, and regulation by resveratrol	Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was recently identified and described as a major novel triglyceride lipase in animals. In this study, we aimed to study the tissue-specific and developmental expres sion pattern of porcine ATGL (pATGL) and the effect of resveratrol (RES) on expression of pATGL in vitro. The full-length cDNA sequence of pATGL was 1,958 bp (accession no. EF583921), with a 1,458-bp open reading frame encoding a 486-AA protein (the predicted molecular mass of 53.2 kDa, accession no. ABS58651). Comparison of the deduced AA sequence with the bovine, mouse, rat, dog, and human adipose triglyceride lipase showed 87, 84, 83, 81, and 80% similarity, respectively. Furthermore, the pATGL was highly expressed in porcine adipose tissue, to a lesser degree in kidney, heart, and muscle, and least but detectable in brain. In s.c. adipose tissue, pATGL mRNA was low at birth (1 kg of BW) and then increased, reaching a maximal value at 20 kg of BW (approximately 8 wk old; P < 0.01). In peritoneal and omental adipose tissue, the greatest expression of pATGL was observed at 40 kg of BW (approximately 12 wk old). In vitro, exposure of cultured adipocytes to 40 and 80 μM RES for 24 h increased the mRNA levels of pATGL by 95.3% (P < 0.05) and 146.8% (P < 0.01), respectively. Accordingly, lipid accumulation was decreased by 25.7% (P < 0.05) and 60.8% (P < 0.01), respectively. When treated with RES for 48 h, the mRNA levels of pATGL were increased by 104.1% (P < 0.05) and 163.1% (P < 0.01), respectively. As expected, lipid accumulation was decreased by 9.7% (P > 0.05) and 29.0% (P < 0.05), respectively. These results add to our understanding of the role of pATGL in adipose tissue development and as a potential target for regulating fat deposition and meat quality. ©2008 American Society of Animal Science.

52949091484	Microinjection of morphine into thalamic nucleus submedius depresses bee venom-induced inflammatory pain in the rat	Previous studies have provided evidence of the existence of a pain modulatory feedback pathway consisting of thalamic nucleus submedius (Sm)-ventrolateral orbital cortex-periaqueductal grey pathway, which is activated during acute pain and leads to depression of transmission of nociceptive information in the spinal dorsal horn. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that morphine microinjection into the Sm decreased spontaneous pain and bilateral thermal hyperalgesia, as well as ipsilateral mechanical allodynia, induced by subcutaneous injections of bee venom into the rat hind paw. Morphine (1.0, 2.5 or 5.0 μg in 0.5 μL) injected into the Sm, contralateral to the bee venom-injected paw, depressed spontaneous nociceptive behaviour in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, morphine significantly decreased bilateral thermal hyperalgesia and ipsilateral mechanical allodynia 2 h after bee venom injection. These morphine-induced effects were antagonized by 1.0 μg naloxone (an opioid antagonist) microinjected into the Sm 5 min before morphine administration. The results provided further support for the important role of the Sm and Sm-opioid receptors in inhibiting nociceptive behaviour and indicated for the first time that Sm opioid receptors were also effective in inhibiting the hypersensitivity provoked by bee venom-induced inflammation. © 2008 The Authors.

53149107824	Bcl-2 and caspase-8 related anoikis resistance in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells	Detachment of adherent cells from extracellular matrix results in apoptosis, a process termed "anoikis". Resistance to anoikis is implicated in the progression of many malignancies by facilitating the migration and eventual colonization of distant sites. Human kidney epithelial cells 293T, human osteoblast cells hFOB 1.19 and human osteosarcoma cells Saos-2 significantly underwent anoikis when adherence was prevented. But human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were distinctly anoikis resistant when detached. They formed large aggregates and showed little apoptosis compared to the other cells. When MG-63 cells were in suspension, caspase-8, physically associated with death receptor was activated by cell-matrix detachment, whereas. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 were not activated. Translational level of Bcl-2 significantly increased in a time-dependent manner, but the level of β-catenin and PI3K did not. Caspase-8 participates in an anoikis-inducing process in MG-63 cells at an early time, and overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks activation of caspase-8 making MG-63 cells anoikis resistant. © 2008 International Federation for Cell Biology.

58149175814	Novel mutations of the ATP2A2 gene in two families with Darier's disease	Darier's disease (DD) is an autosomal dominant genodermatology. Mutations in the ATP2A2 gene encoding sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumping ATPase type 2 (SERCA2) have been identified as the molecular basis of DD. The aim of this study was to report two Chinese pedigree of DD and to explore the genetic mutations. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out to amplify the exons and flanking intron boundaries of the ATP2A2 gene followed by direct sequencing. Two novel missense mutations were identified, a change of C203 to A (A68E) in exon 3 was found in one family and a change of C2759 to T (S920F) in exon 19 in the other, which were located within the transmembrane domain of SERCA2, highly conserved during evolution. The A68E and S920F mutations might be regarded as the causes of the disease in two Chinese families, but these were not tested functionally. Additional functional experiments are necessary to verify the relevance and suitability of these findings for future use in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

63149114604	Induction of apoptosis by Hax-1 siRNA in melanoma cells	HS1-associated protein X-1 (Hax-1) is a novel intracellular protein and recent studies suggested that it is an anti-apoptotic factor in different tumors. Hax-1 expression was upregulated in various metastatic tumors and cancer cell lines, including melanoma. To understand the role of Hax-1 in melanoma development and progression, we constructed Hax-1 short interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors to downregulate Hax-1 expression in a human melanoma A375 cell line. One of the two Hax-1 RNA interference (RNAi) constructs significantly reduced melanoma cell viability, which was due to induction of apoptosis in A375 cells. Molecularly, the induced apoptosis through downregulation of Hax-1 expression was mediated by activation of caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymatic activity in A375 cells. The data indicate that Hax-1 plays a role in suppression of apoptosis and promotion of melanoma cell growth, suggesting that this Hax-1 siRNA has a therapeutic indication in control of melanoma. © 2009 International Federation for Cell Biology.

66749182373	Inhibitory effects of microinjection of morphine into thalamic nucleus submedius on ipsilateral paw bee venom-induced inflammatory pain in the rat	Objective: To examine whether microinjection of morphine into the rat thalamic nucleus submedius (Sm) could depress the bee venom (BV)-induced nociceptive behaviours. Methods: In inflammatory pain model induced by BV subcutaneous injection into rat unilateral hind paw, the inhibitory effects of morphine microinjection into thalamic nucleus submedius (Sm) on the spontaneous nociceptive behavior, heat hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia, and the influence of naloxone on the morphine effects were observed in the rat. Results: A single dose of morphine (5. 0 μg, 0.5 μL) applied into the Sm ipsilateral to the BV injected paw significantly depressed the spontaneous paw flinching response. Morphine also significantly increased the heat paw withdrawal latencies in the bilateral hind paw and the tactile paw withdrawal threshold in the ipsilateral hind paw 2 hours after BV injection. All these depressive effects could be effectively antagonized by pre-treatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1.0 μg, 0.5 μL) in the Sm 5min prior to morphine administration. Naloxone alone injected to the Sm had no effect on the BV-induced nociceptive behavior. Conclusion: These results suggest that Sm is involved in opioid receptor-mediated anti-nociception in the rat with the BV-induced inflammatory pain. Together with results, from previous studies, it is likely that this effect is produced by activation of the Sm-ventrolateral orbital cortex-periaqueductal gray pathway, leading to activation of the brainstem descending inhibitory system and depression of the nociceptive inputs at the spinal cord level.

Methods: Keratinocytes from fetus, teenager and middle-aged groups were separated and cultured. The population doubling time (PDT) and cell growth curve in different cells were compared, and the cell cycles were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Circled digit one In primary culture of keratinocytes, the adherence time in middle-aged group was longer than that in fetus and teenager groups. However, all cell morphology showed no obvious differences. In subculture of keratinocytes, with donator's age increasing, time of cell adherence prolonged, passage number decreased and differences in cell morphology were obvious. Circled digit two The average PDT of keratinocytes was shorter in fetus group than in teenager and middle-aged groups. But difference in cell growth curve between different passages was not observed. Circled digit three Keratinocytes showed G2/M period in fetus group but G0/G1 period in teenager and middle-aged groups mainly. Conclusion: As age increases, the biological properties of keratinocytes change obviously.

67449123057	Growth hormone stimulation of serum insulin concentration in cattle: Nutritional dependency and potential mechanisms	Previous studies on the effect of growth hormone (GH) on serum insulin concentration in cattle had generated seemingly conflicting results, and little was known about the mechanism by which GH affects serum insulin concentration in cattle, if it does. In this study, we determined whether the effect of GH on serum insulin concentration in cattle could be affected by the nutritional levels of the animal and whether GH increased serum insulin concentration in cattle by directly stimulating insulin release or insulin gene expression in the pancreatic islets. Administration of recombinant bovine GH increased serum insulin concentration in nonlactating, nonpregnant beef cows fed a daily concentrate meal in addition to ad libitum hay, but it had no effect in those cows fed hay only. Both GH treatments for 1 and 24 h increased insulin concentrations in cultures of pancreatic islets isolated from growing cattle. Growth hormone treatment for 24 h increased insulin mRNA expression in cultured bovine pancreatic islets. Growth hormone treatment for 16 h increased reporter gene expression directed by a ∼1,500-bp bovine insulin gene promoter in a rat insulin-producing β cell line. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous GH can increase serum insulin concentration in cattle, but this effect depends on the nutritional levels of fed cattle, and that GH increases serum insulin concentration in cattle by stimulating both insulin release and insulin gene expression in the pancreatic islets. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67349115672	Activation of mu-opioid receptors in thalamic nucleus submedius depresses bee venom-evoked spinal c-Fos expression and flinching behavior	Previous studies have indicated that μ-opioid receptors in the thalamic nucleus submedius (Sm) are involved in descending antinociception in behavioral tests. The present study examined the effect of μ-opioid receptor activation in the Sm upon bee venom-evoked c-Fos expression in the spinal dorsal horn associated with flinching behavior, and determined whether the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K-ATP channel) was involved in this effect in a rat model. A dilute bee venom solution, subcutaneously injected unilaterally into a rat hind paw pad, induced significant c-Fos expression in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn, which is associated with paw flinching behavior. This effect was depressed by microinjection of the μ-opioid receptor agonist [d-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) into the Sm, which was antagonized by pre-treatment with μ-receptor antagonist β-funaltrexamine at the same Sm site. Further studies found that glibenclamide, a K-ATP channel inhibitor, also blocked DAMGO-induced inhibition. These results provide functional anatomic support for the involvement of Sm and μ-opioid receptors in the modulation of persistent inflammatory nociception, and suggest that these effects were produced by opening K-ATP channel and inhibiting neuronal activity. Together with previous studies, the inhibition of the neuronal activity induced by μ-opioid receptor activation may activate descending antinociceptive pathways through a GABAergic disinhibitory mechanism and depress the nociceptive information transmission at the level of the spinal cord. © 2009 IBRO.

69849087207	Variation patterns of two degradation enzyme systems in articular cartilage in different stages of osteoarthritis: Regulation by dehydroepiandrosterone	Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial degenerative joint disease in which the cartilaginous matrix of the articular joint is destroyed in a continuous process. We evaluated mRNA levels of cysteine proteinases/cystatin C system and urokinase plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (uPA/PAI-1) system in articular cartilage and regulation by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in different stages of osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: One hundred and eight rabbits underwent anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) in the left knee, 54 received weekly intra-articular injections of DHEA (100 μmol/l) 0.3 ml 3 weeks after transaction as DHEA group. Thirty-six rabbits (18 from 2 groups respectively) were euthanized 6, 9, and 12 weeks after ACLT. All left knee joints were assessed by gross morphology and histology, meantime the gene expression from articular cartilage was analyzed. Results: Cathepsins and uPA gene increased significantly 6 weeks and reached peak in the 9th week, while declined to extremely low levels 12 weeks after ACLT. Cystatin C decreased accompanied by OA progression, while PAI-1 expressed in the same trend with uPA. Additionally, these 2 enzyme systems were markedly suppressed by DHEA 6 and 9 weeks after ACLT but not in the 12th week. Conclusion: The variation of these 2 enzyme systems was closely related to the progression of OA, and could be regulated by DHEA especially in the early and medium stages of OA. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A phylotype-specific multiplex-PCR showed that 198 isolates belonged to phylotype I (bv. 3, 4 and 5) and 68 to phylotype II (bv. 2 and bv. 1). A phylogenetic analysis examined the partial sequence of the egl and hrpB gene of all strains and the genetic diversity of 95 representatives was reported, demonstrating that Chinese strains are partitioned into phylotype I (Asia) and II (Americas). Phylotype I strains (historically typed bv. 3, 4 and 5), had considerable phylogenetic diversity, including 10 different sequevars: seven previously described sequevars 12 to 18 and three new sequevars: 34, 44 and 48. Chinese strains Z1, Z2, Z3, Z7, Pe74 and Tm82 were not genetically distinguishable from the edible ginger reference strain ACH92 (r4-bv. 4) for sequevar 16. This is believed to be the first report of this ginger group in China. All Chinese bv. 2 strains falling into the genetically and phenotypically diverse phylotype II were placed into phylotype IIB sequevar 1 (historically the Andean race3-bv. 2 potato brown rot agent). In both the egl and hrpB sequence-based trees, strains isolated from mulberry were present in two distinct branches found in sequevars 12 and 48 (reference strains R292 and M2, respectively). ©KNPV 2009.

72949083573	Analysis of a Blumeria graminis-secreted lipase reveals the importance of host epicuticular wax components for fungal adhesion and development	The biotrophic powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis releases extracellular materials to the surface of fungal infection structures that facilitate anchoring them to hydrophobic plant surfaces prior to infection; however, the chemistry of fungal adhesives and the mechanism of adhesion remain largely unclear. Expressed sequence tag analysis led to identification of a secreted lipase, Lip1, from B. graminis. Expression of LIPI is dramatically upregulated during the early stages of fungal development. Lip1, secreted to the surface of fungal cell walls, possesses lipolytic activity against a broad range of glycerides and releases alkanes and primary fatty alcohols from the epicuticular wax of wheat leaves. Of the epicuticular wax components released by Lip1 activity, long-chain alkanes are the most efficient cues for triggering appressorium formation. Pretreatment of wheat leaves with Lip1, thereby removing leaf surface wax, severely compromises components of fungal pathogenicity, including conidial adhesion, appressorium formation, and secondary hypha growth. Our data suggest that Lip1 activity releases cues from the host surface to promote pathogen development and infection. © 2009 The American Phytopathological Society.

Mutations in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In the present study, we screened a Chinese family with EB pruriginosa for COL7A1 mutations by PCR amplification of genomic sequences and direct nucleotide sequencing. The mutation consists of a G→T substitution at nucleotide 6724 in exon 85, which leads to the substitution of glycine by tryptophan at codon 2242. This report adds new variants to the known COL7A1 mutations underlying EB pruriginosa, and provides the basis for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis for affected families. © 2008 British Association of Dermatologists.

76649128721	Enhanced anticancer effect of gemcitabine by genistein in osteosarcoma: The role of Akt and nuclear factor-κB	Genistein, a nontoxic flavonoid compound, has potent antitumor activity in various cancer cell lines. This study was designed to investigate whether combination therapy with gemcitabine and genistein enhances antitumor efficacy in osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63 and U2OS). Our results show that significant reduction in cell viability and corresponding induction of apoptosis were observed with combination treatment in both cell lines. On the molecular level, we found that gemcitabine alone can activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in osteosarcoma, suggesting the potential mechanism of acquired chemoresistance. In contrast, genistein reversed the cancer's resistance to gemcitabine through the downregulation of NF-κB activity and the suppression of Akt. These findings suggest that the combination of gemcitabine and genistein enhanced the antitumor efficacy by abrogating the Akt/NF-κB pathway. The marked ability to induce apoptosis with a combination of gemcitabine and genistein suggests that this could be a rational and novel approach for osteosarcoma preclinical and clinical trials. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77950445336	Population genetic analyses of Fusarium asiaticum populations from Barley suggest a recent shift favoring 3ADON producers in Southern China	Fusarium asiaticum is the predominant causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in southern China. The genetic diversity was assessed by analyzing 448 single-spore F. asiaticum isolates from 18 sampling sites that were 10 to 2,000 km apart, using seven highly informative variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. This analysis showed a significant degree of population subdivision (P < 0.001) among populations from upper, middle, and lower valleys of the Yangtze River, with little gene flow (Nm = 1.210). We observed a strong association between this genetic population subdivision and the mycotoxin produced. Our results show that the dramatic cline in trichothecene chemotypes may be explained by a recent and significant invasion of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3ADON) producers in FHB pathogen composition in the middle valley. Using Bayesian statistics, we found a biased gene flow from 3ADON to nivalenol (NIV) populations. In addition, we observed significant genetic differentiation and linkage disequilibrium between NIV- and 3ADONproducing isolates at the same sampling sites.

77951938251	Geographic substructure of Fusarium asiaticum isolates collected from barley in China	Fusarium head blight (FHB) can affect wheat and barley and is a devastating disease caused by a complex of Fusarium species. Here we report on a large-scale survey on the genetic diversity of isolates collected from barley in China. Ten VNTR markers were tested on a representative set of 40 isolates covering 14 sampling areas along the Yangtze River. VNTR4 and VNTR7, with 13 and 6 alleles, each were applied to a total of 1106 single-spore isolates to reveal the population structure of F. asiaticum. The F. asiaticum population showed high genetic diversity and a clear genotypic substructure within China. Pair-wise comparisons of allele frequencies between the mountainous provinces of Sichuan and Chongqing in Western China, Hubei Province in the centre or the eastern provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai showed significant differences. Even between counties of the same province, significant differences between allele frequencies were found (P < 0.001). Our results indicate serious constraints for migration of this pathogen in the major cereal-growing areas of China. © 2010 KNPV.

77955708632	Isolation and genotyping of vaginal non-albicans Candida spp. in women from two different ethnic groups in Lanzhou, China	Objective: To investigate whether the vaginal flora of women from 2 different ethnic groups living in the same region of China harbored the same species of Candida in the same proportions. Methods: The ethnicity of the women was determined by conventional cultural identification, and the Candida spp. harbored by the women were determined by conventional methods and DNA genotyping. Results: Candida albicans accounted for 77.1% and 89.6%, respectively, of the Candida spp. isolated from the normal vaginal flora of Han Chinese and Tibetan women. This difference was statistically significant and may explain the differences in the rates of opportunistic infections in these 2 groups. Among the non-albicans Candida spp. isolated were C. glabrata and C. tropicalis. Conclusion: Different species of Candida were differently distributed in the normal vaginal flora of ethnic Han Chinese and Tibetan women living in the same geographic region. © 2010 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

77955458272	Increased serum concentrations of visfatin and its production by different joint tissues in patients with osteoarthritis	Background: The goal of this study was to investigate the distribution of visfatin in paired serum and synovial fluid (SF) samples from patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and in serum from healthy controls. In addition, we wished to determine the potential sources of visfatin in joint tissue. Methods: Twenty-three patients with OA requiring total knee arthroplasty (TKA), 17 healthy subjects and ten donors requiring amputation were included in the study. Concentrations of visfatin in serum and SF were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The concentration of visfatin was also measured in conditioned media from cultured joint tissues. Results: We found serum visfatin concentrations to be higher in patients with OA compared to healthy controls (p<0.05), and SF-visfatin concentrations exceeded those in paired serum (p=0.004). In addition, infrapatellar fat pad and synovium were important sources of visfatin, while osteophytes released largest amounts of visfatin. Therefore, osteophytes can be considered a major source of visfatin in the knee joint in patients with OA. Conclusions: These results suggest that visfatin may be involved in the pathophysiology of OA and may have local effects in the joint during the process of OA. © 2010 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.

77955869511	Effect of acitretin on the T helper cells of psoriasis vulgaris	Objective: To investigate the effects of acitretin on T helper cell (Th) 1/Th2 balance and Th17 cells in psoriasis vulgaris (PV) patients. Methods: A total of 13 men and 17 women with PV were investigated. 10 mg of acitretin was administered twice a day for 8 weeks for intervention therapy. Serum levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (ID-4 and IL-17 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. T, Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells in skin biopsies were counted with double-labeled immunofluorescence. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was calculated before and 8 weeks after treatment. Results: Before treatment PV patients had higher serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-17, and increased T, Th1 and Th17 cells in skin biopsies. After treatment, both serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-17, and T, Th1 and Th17 cells infiltrating in PV skin decreased significantly. Th1/Th2 balance was restored to normal. However, their IL-4 and Th2 cells showed no significant change throughout the therapy. Conclusion: Acitretin exerts influence on dermal Th1/Th2 balance and Th17 cell infiltration, so does it on production of systematic inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17 in PV patients. However, Th2 cells and its derivative cytokine - IL-4 are not affected.

77956946117	Leptin plays a catabolic role on articular cartilage	Leptin has been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of body weight. There is also evidence that this adipokine plays a key role in the process of osteoarthritis. However, the precise role of leptin on articular cartilage metabolism is not clear. We investigate the role of leptin on articular cartilage in vivo in this study. Recombinant rat leptin (100 μg) was injected into the knee joints of rats, 48 h later, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), cathepsin D, and collagen II from articular cartilage were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot. Two important aggrecanases ADAMTS-4 and -5 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 and 5) were also analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Besides, articular cartilage was also assessed for proteoglycan/GAG content by Safranin O staining. Leptin significantly increased both gene and protein levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, cathepsin D, and collagen II, while decreased bFGF markedly in cartilage. Moreover, the gene expression of ADAMTS-4 and -5 were markedly increased, and histologically assessed depletion of proteoglycan in articular cartilage was observed after treatment with leptin. These results strongly suggest that leptin plays a catabolic role on cartilage metabolism and may be a disadvantage factor involve in the pathological process of OA. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

78149460199	Alleviation of osteoarthritis by Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in experimental osteoarthritis	This study investigated the effects of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on cartilage degradation in an experimental model of osteoarthritis (OA). Thirty-two male New Zealand rabbits underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) on left knee joints to induce OA and were randomly divided into two groups (n = 16), the TSA group was injected intra-articularly with 0.3 ml TSA [250 ng/ml in the dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO)], the OA group received DSMO since 4 weeks after operation once a week for 5 weeks. Rabbits were killed seven days after the last injection. Left knee cartilage was harvested for morphological, histological and genetic analysis. Another ten rabbits were used for normal control and received no injection. The TSA group showed less cartilage degradation as compared to the OA group assessed by morphological and histological evaluation. Gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, MMP-13, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) was increased significantly in the OA group compared to the normal group. The elevated expression was reduced by TSA. Our results suggest that TSA could be considered as a potential agent for treatment for OA. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79955536429	Supernatant of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells induces peripheral blood mononuclear cells possessing mesenchymal features	Increasing evidence shows that some cells from peripheral blood fibroblast-like mononuclear cells have the capacity to differentiate into mesenchymal lineages. However, the insufficiency of these cells in the circulation challenges the cell isolation and subsequently limits the clinical application of these cells. In the present study, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbMNCs) were isolated from wound animals and treated with the supernatant of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (bmMSCs). Results showed these pbMNCs were fibroblast-like, had stromal morphology, were negative for CD34 and CD45, but positive for Vimentin and Collagen I, and had the multipotency to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts We named these induced peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ipbMSCs). Skin grafts in combination with ipbMSCs and collagen I were applied for wound healing, and results revealed ipbMSC exhibited similar potency and effectiveness in the promotion of wound healing to the bmMSCs. Hereafter, we speculate that the mixture of growth factors and chemokines secreted by bmMSCs may play an important roles in the induction of the proliferation and mesenchymal differentiation of mononuclear cells. Our results are clinically relevant because it provide a new method for the acquisition of MSCs which can be used as a candidate for the wound repair. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

0036659576	Effect of high temperature thermal shocking on the mechanical property and microstructure of stainless steel J75	The mechanical property change and property damage mechanism of austenitic precipitation-hardened stainless steel J75, under different temperature thermal shockings and several thermal shockings at some certain temperatures, were investigated . The experiment results indicated that, in the case of impact within 1s, the strength and elongation of the alloy have no change when the single or multi thermal shocking temperatures are below 610°C, but decreased evidently above 750°C with increase of thermal shocking frequency . The microscopic analysis showed that, increasing the temperature and frequency of thermal shocking would refine the grain and make the precipitation phase change apparently . When the temperature was above 750°C, a large amount of platelet η phase would precipitate and γ′ phase would coarse and distribute inhomogeneously, which are the main reason for the apparent decrease of the alloy strength and elongation.

79960700508	The effect of injection volume on disc degeneration in a rat tail model	Study Design.: A prospective study to compare the effects of injection of various doses of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution into the intervertebral disc. Objective.: To evaluate the effect of injection volume on disc degeneration in a rat tail-disc model. Summary of Background Data.: There are many studies on disc degeneration models induced by needle injection. Recently, novel treatments for disc degeneration have been developed that are administered by injection. However, it is unknown whether injection volume affects disc degeneration. Methods.: A total of 180 Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups and injected with 0(control), 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 μL of PBS solution. Discs were harvested at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after injection and were evaluated using radiography, histology, and biochemistry (glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and water content). Results.: No significant differences in radiography, biochemistry, or histology were observed at any of the three sampling times between the 1.0, 2.0 μL groups and the control. The 2.5 and 3.0 μL groups exhibited significant decrease in radiographic disc height index and water content since week 2. The glycosaminoglycan content of 2.5 μL group decreased significantly by week 4 and that of 3.0 μL group decreased at weeks 2 and 4. Significant hydroxyproline content decrease was only observed for 3.0 μL group during week 4. Significantly higher histologic score was observed in 3.0 μL group since week 1 and 2.5 μL group since week 2. The three parameters of 3.0 μL group indicated more severe disc degeneration than those of 2.5 μL group, particularly during week 4. Conclusion.: When the volume of PBS injected into the rat tail-disc exceeded a threshold, it rapidly exhibited degenerative changes according to radiographic, biochemical, and histologic analysis. The degenerative changes were dose-dependent and increased as the dose increased. © 2011, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

80053094844	p53 siRNA inhibits apoptosis of U2OS cells treated with azurin	The bacterial redox protein azurin selectively induces apoptosis in human osteosarcoma U2OScells. We constructed a p53 siRNA to test the role that p53 plays in the apoptosis-inducing role of azurin in U2OS cells. Cells treated with p53 siRNA and azurin showed more viable cells, a lower apoptosis rate, lower caspase-3 activity, and up-regulation of bcl-2, downregulation of bax compared to cells treated with negative siRNA and azurin. Cells treated with negative siRNA and azurin yielded positive TUNEL dying, whereas cells treated with p53 siRNA and azurin yielded few positive cells. These results suggested that p53 siRNA was capable of inhibi-ting the apoptosis induced by azurin 2days after treatment with p53 siRNA and azurin. Azurin may induce apoptosis through combination with p53. The decrease in p53 protein levels did not inhibit cell apoptosis rates, but rather increased these rates in U2OS osteosarcoma cells 3days after treatment with p53 siRNA. Since U2OS cells are p53 wild-type cancer cells, p53 potentially acts as an oncogene in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Treatment with azurin may transform the function of p53 from inhibiting to inducing apoptosis.

80054089060	Whole genome analysis of linezolid resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals resistance and compensatory mutations	Background: Several mutations were present in the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae linezolid-resistant strains but the role of several of these mutations had not been experimentally tested. To analyze the role of these mutations, we reconstituted resistance by serial whole genome transformation of a novel resistant isolate into two strains with sensitive background. We sequenced the parent mutant and two independent transformants exhibiting similar minimum inhibitory concentration to linezolid.Results: Comparative genomic analyses revealed that transformants acquired G2576T transversions in every gene copy of 23S rRNA and that the number of altered copies correlated with the level of linezolid resistance and cross-resistance to florfenicol and chloramphenicol. One of the transformants also acquired a mutation present in the parent mutant leading to the overexpression of an ABC transporter (spr1021). The acquisition of these mutations conferred a fitness cost however, which was further enhanced by the acquisition of a mutation in a RNA methyltransferase implicated in resistance. Interestingly, the fitness of the transformants could be restored in part by the acquisition of altered copies of the L3 and L16 ribosomal proteins and by mutations leading to the overexpression of the spr1887 ABC transporter that were present in the original linezolid-resistant mutant.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the usefulness of whole genome approaches at detecting major determinants of resistance as well as compensatory mutations that alleviate the fitness cost associated with resistance. © 2011 Billal et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80053913116	Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of linezolid resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae	Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that inhibits the initiation of translation. Although resistance to linezolid is an uncommon event, it has been reported in clinical isolates. The genome sequence of Streptococcus pneumoniae linezolid-resistant mutants recently revealed mutations associated with resistance. A proteomic and transcriptomic screen now reveals a possible increase in the metabolism and transport of carbohydrates in these linezolid-resistant S. pneumoniae mutants. Several glycolytic proteins were shown to be overexpressed in the resistant strains, along with other enzymes and transporters involved in the metabolism of sugars. An increase in energy needs appears to be required to sustain extended levels of resistance to linezolid as the disruption of two ABC transporters putatively involved in the import of carbohydrates leads to a 2-fold sensitization to linezolid. Furthermore, the disruption of the catabolite control protein A, a regulator of the metabolism of sugars whose expression is highly increased in one linezolid-resistant mutant, resulted in a 2-fold increase in linezolid susceptibility. This global scale analysis of gene and protein expression profiling highlights metabolism alterations associated with linezolid resistance in S. pneumoniae. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The KU70 disruption strain showed no apparent defect in vegetable growth, conidiation and pathogenicity on wheat and barley compared with the wild-type strain. The effect of the absence of KU70 on gene replacement frequency was tested by disruption of TOXA encoding toxin A and LIP2 encoding a putative lipase. Frequency of gene replacement for both genes was dramatically increased in the KU70 disruption strain, compared with the low frequency in the wild-type recipient. © 2011.

84857386364	Population analysis of the Fusarium graminearum species complex from wheat in China show a shift to more aggressive isolates	A large number of Fusarium isolates was collected from blighted wheat spikes originating from 175 sampling sites, covering 15 provinces in China. Species and trichothecene chemotype determination by multilocus genotyping (MLGT) indicated that F. graminearum s. str. with the 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol (15ADON) chemotype and F. asiaticum with either the nivalenol (NIV) or the 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol (3ADON) chemotype were the dominant causal agents. Bayesian model-based clustering with allele data obtained with 12 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) markers, detected three genetic clusters that also show distinct chemotypes. High levels of population genetic differentiation and low levels of effective number of migrants were observed between these three clusters. Additional genotypic analyses revealed that F. graminearum s. str. and F. asiaticum are sympatric. In addition, composition analysis of these clusters indicated a biased gene flow from 3ADON to NIV producers in F. asiaticum. In phenotypic analyses, F. asiaticum that produce 3ADON revealed significant advantages over F. asiaticum that produce NIV in pathogenicity, growth rate, fecundity, conidial length, trichothecene accumulation and resistance to benzimidazole. These results suggest that natural selection drives the spread of a more vigorous, more toxigenic pathogen population which also shows higher levels of fungicide resistance. © 2012 Zhang et al.

After inoculated with Bacillus subtilis BJ-1 for 48 h, the content of free gossypol in cottonseed meal was decreased from 0.82 to 0.21 g/kg. A total of 600, dayold male yellow-feathered broilers were randomly divided into four groups with three replicates of 50 chicks each. A corn-SBM based control diet was formulated and the experimental diets included 4, 8 or 12% FCSM, replacing SBM. Throughout the experiment, broilers fed 8% FCSM had higher (p<0.05) body weight gain than those fed 0, 4 and 12% FCSM. The feed intake in 8% FCSM group was superior (p<0.05) to other treatments from d 21 to 42. On d 21, the concentration of serum immunoglobin M in the 4% and 8% FCSM groups, as well as the content of complements (C3, C4) in 8% FCSM group were greater (p<0.05) than those in the SBM group. Besides, birds fed 8% FCSM had increased (p<0.05) serum immunoglobin M, immunoglobulin G and complement C4 levels on d 42 compared with bird fed control diet. No differences (p>0.05) were found between treatments regarding the serum biochemical parameters and the relative weights of immune organs. In conclusion, FCSM can be used in broiler diets at up to 12% of the total diet and an appropriate replacement of SBM with FCSM may improve growth performance and immunity in broilers.

Microarray analysis was applied to examine the gene expression changes in medulloblastomas of pTet-on/pTRE-SV40Tag transgenic mice. Altogether, 14 112 genes were detectable, including 152 genes with significantly different expression levels. These genes were associated with immunity, the cell cycle, signal transduction, cytoskeleton and metabolism. To further confirm the microarray data, real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to examine the expression changes of genes related to sonic hedgehog, Wnt/beta-catenin and insulin-like growth factor signal pathways. Immunohistochemistry detected insulin receptor substrate-1 in the nuclei of brain tumor tissue cells from pTet-on/pTRE-SV40Tag transgenic mice, suggesting that SV40 large T antigen may activate the insulin-like growth factor signal pathway to promote tumorigenesis.

84863400711	Influence of circulating fibrocytes on the growth, proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts	Circulating fibrocytes (CFs) exhibit an extraordinary degree of plasticity and growth factor repertoire, and because of this they have been investigated for their role in the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues, but yet not adequately for their role in wound healing. In the present study, CFs were co-cultured with keratinocytes (KCs) or fibroblasts (Fbs) and the influences of CFs on the growth, proliferation and migration of KCs and Fbs were investigated. Our results showed that the CFs in the co-culture system could inhibit the growth, proliferation and migration of KCs, while CFs promoted the growth and proliferation of Fbs. Our study demonstrates that CFs can regulate the functions of Fbs, which may be a possible cause of fibrosis. © Journal of Applied Biomedicine.

84863523542	Ferroferric oxide/chitosan scaffolds with three-dimensional oriented structure	A facile approach to construct ferroferric oxide/chitosan composite scaffolds with three-dimensional oriented structure has been explored in this research. Chitosan and ferroferric oxide are co-precipitated by using an in situ precipitation method, and then lyophilized to get the composite scaffolds. XRD indicated that Fe3O4 was generated during the gel formation process, and increasing the content of magnetic particles could destruct the crystal structure of chitosan. When the content of magnetic particles is lower than 10%, the layer-by-layer structure and wheel spoke structure are coexisting in the scaffolds. Increasing the content of magnetic particles, just layer-by-layer structure could be observed in the scaffolds. Ferroferric oxide particles were uniformly distributed in the matrix, the size of which was about 0.48 ìm in diameter, 2 ìm in length. Porosity of magnetic chitosan composite scaffolds is about 90%. When the ratio of ferroferric oxide to chitosan is 5/100, the compressive strength of the material is 0.4367 MPa, which is much higher than that of pure chitosan scaffolds, indicating that the layer-by-layer and wheel spokes complex structure is beneficial for the improvement of the mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds. However, increasing the content of ferroferric oxide, the compressive strength of scaffolds decreased, because of the decreasing of chitosan crystallization and aggregation of magnetic particles as stress centralized body. Another reason is that the layer-by-layer and wheel spokes complex structure makes bigger contributions for the compressive strength than the layer-by-layer structure does. Three-dimensional ferroferric oxide/chitosan scaffolds could be used as hyperthermia generator system, improving the local circulation of blood, promoting the aggradation of calcium salt and stimulating bone tissue regeneration. © 2012 Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84868201727	Acitretin exerted a greater influence on T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 than on Th2 cells in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris	T-helper (Th) cells, including Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis vulgaris (PV). Acitretin is an effective treatment for PV; however, its influence on Th cells during the treatment of PV is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of acitretin on Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells in PV patients. PV patients (n = 30) received acitretin p.o. (20 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Sera and skin biopsies were obtained before and after treatment. Double-labeled immunofluorescence was used to analyze T, Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells in skin lesions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot were used to analyze the expressions of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17 in sera and skin lesions. The expressions of IFN-γ mRNA, IL-4 mRNA and IL-17 mRNA in skin lesions were detected by in situ hybridization. Acitretin decreased the quantity of T, Th1 and Th17 cells in PV lesions, but had no significant influence on Th2 cells. Acitretin also decreased the expression of IFN-γ and IL-17 in serum and lesions. The expressions of IFN-γ mRNA and IL-17 mRNA decreased significantly after 8 weeks of therapy. However, acitretin had no significant influence on the expression of IL-4 protein and mRNA. Acitretin can reverse Th1 and Th17 preponderance in PV patients to some degree. This may be due to the mechanism of acitretin on PV; however, Th2 cells were not affected by acitretin treatment. © 2012 Japanese Dermatological Association.

84872961478	Effects of thioredoxin: Sumo and intein on soluble fusion expression of an antimicrobial peptide OG2 in escherichia coli	OG2 is a modified antimicrobial peptide of Palustrin-OG1 (OG1), which is derived from Odorrana grahami frog. OG2 has shown much higher selective antimicrobial activity and lower hemolytic activity than OG1, indicating OG2 may be a promising antimicrobial agent. In this study, we investigated three fusion partners, including thioredoxin, Mxe GyrA intein, and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), each fused with OG2, and examined their effects on the expression level and solubility of OG2 in Escherichia coli. The codon-optimized OG2 gene was cloned into pET32a (+) and pTWIN1 for fusion with thioredoxin and Mxe GyrA intein, respectively. In addition, the SUMO-OG2 gene was amplified by splice overlap extension PCR method and was cloned into pET30a (+). All recombinant plasmids were then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and the expressed fusion proteins were verified. Upon isopropyl α-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction, OG2 fused with thioredoxin (Trx-OG2) showed the highest yield as a soluble fusion protein (50 mg/L), followed by Mxe GyrA intein (44 mg/L) and SUMO (11 mg/L). The thioredoxin-fused protein (Trx-OG2) was then purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography and desalted by Sephadex G25. The OG2 released by both tobacco etch virus protease and enterokinase from Trx-OG2 showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923.

84876940241	Marine Sediment Bacteria Harbor Antibiotic Resistance Genes Highly Similar to Those Found in Human Pathogens	The ocean is a natural habitat for antibiotic-producing bacteria, and marine aquaculture introduces antibiotics into the ocean to treat infections and improve aquaculture production. Studies have shown that the ocean is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes. However, there is a lack of understanding and knowledge about the clinical importance of the ocean resistome. We investigated the relationship between the ocean bacterial resistome and pathogenic resistome. We applied high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses to explore the resistance genes in bacterial plasmids from marine sediments. Numerous putative resistance determinants were detected among the resistance genes in the sediment bacteria. We also found that several contigs shared high identity with transposons or plasmids from human pathogens, indicating that the sediment bacteria recently contributed or acquired resistance genes from pathogens. Marine sediment bacteria could play an important role in the global exchange of antibiotic resistance. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84878504761	Functional integrity and modification of retinal dopaminergic neurons in the rd1 mutant mouse: Roles of melanopsin and GABA	The progressive loss of rod and cone photoreceptors in human subjects with retinitis pigmentosa causes a gradual decline in vision and can result in blindness. Current treatment strategies for the disease rely on the integrity of inner retinal neurons, such as amacrine cells, that are postsynaptic to photoreceptors. Previous work has demonstrated that a specialized subclass of retinal amacrine cell that synthesizes and releases the key neurotransmitter dopamine remains morphologically intact during the disease; however, the pathophysiological function of these neurons remains poorly understood. Here we examined spontaneous and light-evoked spike activity of genetically labeled dopamine neurons from the retinas of retinal degeneration 1 (rd1) mice. Our results indicated that rd1 dopamine neurons remained functionally intact with preserved spontaneous spiking activity and light-evoked responses. The light responses were mediated exclusively by melanopsin phototransduction, not by surviving cones. Our data also suggested that dopamine neurons were altered during photoreceptor loss, as evidenced by less spontaneous bursting activity and increased light-evoked responses with age. Further evidence showed that these alterations were attributed to enhanced GABA/melanopsin signaling to dopamine neurons during disease progression. Taken together, our studies provide valuable information regarding the preservation and functional modification of the retinal dopamine neuronal system in rd1; this information should be considered when designing treatment strategies for retinitis pigmentosa. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

By this model, the frequency dispersive characteristic of phase velocity for the ZnO/Si layered structure is calculated. The calculation results are in agreement with the experimental results, which verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the model. Furthermore, the model is also established for the determination of the phase velocity and electromechanical coupling coefficients of ZnO/Diamond/Si structure.

84880876139	Effects of amino acid deletion and substitution on the chemical properties, biological activities of the frog peptide palustrin-OG1	Palustrin-OG1 (OG1) is a host defense peptide isolated from the frog Odorrana grahami. In this study, we analyzed the chemical properties, antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicities of OG1 and its derivatives to identify the most promising peptide as an antimicrobial agent. By increasing the net positive charge, amphipathicity and decreasing the mean hydrophobicity of OG1, the derivative named as OG2 exerted higher antimicrobial activity against bacteria but lower cytotoxicity against both porcine erythrocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells than did OG1 (P<0.01). After substitution of Cys residues of OG2 by Ala or Trp residues, two derivatives named as OG2A and OG2W were less effective against bacteria and induced greater hemolysis than did OG2, indicating the importance of Cys residues. The substitution of the C-terminal Thr of OG2 resulted OG2N, which decreased the cytotoxicity and improved killing kinetics against gram-positive bacteria by the rapid damage of cell wall and membrane. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84883448009	Development of a specific molecular tool for the detection of epidemiologically active mulberry causing-disease strains of Ralstonia solanacearum phylotype I (historically race 5-biovar 5) in China	Ralstonia solanacearum causes bacterial wilt disease in many plant species, including mulberry. Here, we used a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach to identify specific DNA fragments in R. solanacearum race 5-biovar 5. The genome of the R. solanacearum M7 strain was subtracted from that of the GMI1000 strain, resulting in the identification of 85 subtracted fragments. The primer set MG67-F/R for identification of Ralstonia solanacearum race 5-biovar 5 strains was designed on the basis of the clone MG67 sequence. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR was developed by using the primer set MG67-F/MG67R in combination with the species-specific primer pair 759/760. A 156 bp r5-bv5-specific fragment, together with a 282 bp species-specific fragment, was amplified from all tested R. solanacearum r5-bv5 strains. The sensitivity of the multiplex PCR made it possible to detect concentrations as low as 10

84886629645	Effects of doped boron on surface morphology of diamond films	Boron doped diamond films with high conductivity have found their wide applications in the field of electrical and electrochemistry. To investigate the effects of the boron concentration on the surface morphology, boron doped diamond films are prepared on silicon substrates by hot filament chemical vapor deposition. The surface morphology is analyzed by SEM to study the effects of boron concentration on polycrystalline diamond films. Results show that an appropriate amount of boron doped is good for nucleation and growth of diamond films, since the grains are finer with the crystal shape integrated. However, a heavy amount of boron doped shows an opposite trend, the B atom will enhance the coupling of the adjacent grains; with further increase of the boron concentration, the diamond grain size tends to become coarse and uneven.

84893374259	Characterization of a multiresistant mosaic plasmid from a fish farm sediment Exiguobacterium sp. isolate reveals aggregation of functional clinic-associated antibiotic resistance genes	The genus Exiguobacterium can adapt readily to, and survive in, diverse environments. Our study demonstrated that Exiguobacterium sp. strain S3-2, isolated from marine sediment, is resistant to five antibiotics. The plasmid pMC1 in this strain carries seven putative resistance genes. We functionally characterized these resistance genes in Escherichia coli, and genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase and macrolide phosphotransferase were considered novel resistance genes based on their low similarities to known resistance genes. The plasmid G+C content distribution was highly heterogeneous. Only the G+C content of one block, which shared significant similarity with a plasmid from Exiguobacterium arabatum, fit well with the mean G+C content of the host. The remainder of the plasmid was composed of mobile elements with a markedly lower G+C ratio than the host. Interestingly, five mobile elements located on pMC1 showed significant similarities to sequences found in pathogens. Our data provided an example of the link between resistance genes in strains from the environment and the clinic and revealed the aggregation of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria isolated from fish farms. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

84896816475	Recombinant expression of antimicrobial peptides using a novel self-cleaving aggregation tag in escherichia coli	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the innate immune system of complex multicellular organisms. Despite the fact that AMPs show great potential as a novel class of antibiotics, the lack of a cost-effective means for their mass production limits both basic research and clinical use. In this work, we describe a novel expression system for the production of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli by combining ΔI-CM mini-intein with the self-assembling amphipathic peptide 18A to drive the formation of active aggregates. Two AMPs, human β-defensin 2 and LL-37, were fused to the self-cleaving tag and expressed as active protein aggregates. The active aggregates were recovered by centrifugation and the intact antimicrobial peptides were released into solution by an intein-mediated cleavage reaction in cleaving buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 40 mmol/L Bis-Tris, 2 mmol/L EDTA, pH 6.2). The peptides were further purified by cation-exchange chromatography. Peptides yields of 0.82 ± 0.24 and 0.59 ± 0.11 mg/L were achieved for human β-defensin 2 and LL-37, respectively, with demonstrated antimicrobial activity. Using our expression system, intact antimicrobial peptides were recovered by simple centrifugation from active protein aggregates after the intein-mediated cleavage reaction. Thus, we provide an economical and efficient way to produce intact antimicrobial peptides in E. coli.

84898606193	The LmSNF1 gene is required for pathogenicity in the canola blackleg pathogen leptosphaeria maculans	Leptosphaeria maculans is a fungal pathogen causing blackleg in canola. Its virulence has been attributed, among other factors, to the activity of hydrolytic cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs). Studies on the pathogenicity function of CWDEs in plant pathogenic fungi have been difficult due to gene redundancy. In microorganisms many CWDE genes are repressed by glucose and derepressed by the function of the sucrose non-fermenting protein kinase 1 gene (SNF1). To address the molecular function of SNF1 in L. maculans, the ortholog of SNF1 (LmSNF1) was cloned and functionally characterized using a gene knockout strategy. Growth of the LmSNF1 knockout strains was severely disrupted, as was sporulation, spore germination and the ability to attach on the plant surface. When inoculated on canola cotyledons, the LmSNF1 knockout strains could not cause any symptoms, indicating the loss of pathogenicity. The expression of 11 selected CWDE genes and a pathogenicity gene (LopB) was significantly down-regulated in the LmSNF1 knockout strains. In conclusion, knockout of LmSNF1 prevents L. maculans from properly derepressing the production of CWDEs, compromises the utilization of certain carbon sources, and impairs fungal pathogenicity on canola. © 2014 Feng et al.

84898622183	Expressing antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin-BF in Bacillus subtilis using SUMO technology	Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) technology has been widely used in Escherichia coli expression systems to produce antimicrobial peptides. However, E. Coli is a pathogenic bacterium that produces endotoxins and can secrete proteins into the periplasm, forming inclusion bodies. In our work, cathelicidin-BF (CBF), an antimicrobial peptide purified from Bungarus fasciatus venom, was produced in a Bacillus subtilis expression system using SUMO technology. The chimeric genes his-SUMO-CBF and his-SUMO protease 1 were ligated into vector pHT43 and expressed in B. subtilis WB800N. Approximately 22 mg of recombinant fusion protein SUMO-CBF and 1 mg of SUMO protease 1 were purified per liter of culture supernatant. Purified SUMO protease 1 was highly active and cleaved his-SUMO-CBF with an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:40. Following cleavage, recombinant CBF was further purified by affinity and cation exchange chromatography. Peptide yields of ~3 mg/l endotoxin-free CBF were achieved, and the peptide demonstrated antimicrobial activity. This is the first report of the production of an endotoxin-free antimicrobial peptide, CBF, by recombinant DNA technology, as well as the first time purified SUMO protease 1 with high activity has been produced from B. subtilis. This work has expanded the application of SUMO fusion technology and may represent a safe and efficient way to generate peptides and proteins in B. subtilis. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84903953011	First report of Fusarium maize ear rot caused by Fusarium meridionale in China	Fusarium is an important genus of fungal pathogens that are responsible for devastating diseases, such as Fusarium ear rot on maize, which may result in yield losses and/or mycotoxin contamination. In September 2013, a survey to determine population composition of Fusarium species on maize was conducted at 22 fields in 18 counties in Gansu Province. Maize ears with clear symptoms (with a white to pink- or salmon-colored mold at the ear tip) were collected. Symptomatic seeds were surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol and 10% sodium hypochlorite and rinsed three times with sterile water to eliminate hypochlorite residues. After drying on sterile filter paper, the seeds were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 3 days. Mycelium that was characteristic of Fusarium spp. (2) was purified by transferring single spores to fresh PDA. Fusarium species were identified by morphological characteristics (2), multilocus genotyping assay (MLGT) (3), and sequence analysis of the translation elongation factor-1α (TEF) gene. Several Fusarium species were identified and Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum were the predominant species. Based on MLGT, two strains from Chenghong County were identified as F. meridionale with NIV chemotype, a species in F. graminearum species complex (FGSC). Morphological characteristics were also identical to FGSC. Colonies grew rapidly on PDA and produce relatively large amounts of dense mycelia and red pigments. Slender, thick-walled, and moderately curved or straight macroconidia were observed with 5- to 6-septate. Furthermore, conidia on SNA also showed typical characteristics of F. meridionale, as the dorsal and ventral lines were often parallel and gradually curved. Sequences comparison of the partial translation elongation factor (TEF-1α, 644 bp) gene (1) was used to validate these observations. BLASTn analysis with the FUSARIUM-ID database revealed 100% sequence identity to F. meridionale (GenBank Accession No. KJ137017). Thus, both morphological and molecular criteria supported identification of the strains as F. meridionale. A pathogenicity test was performed on Zhengdan958, the maize variety with the largest planted acreage in China. Four days after silk emergence, 2 ml conidial suspension (10

84904698829	Expression pattern of porcine antimicrobial peptide PR-39 and its induction by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4ac	PR-39 is a gene-encoded, proline-arginine-rich porcine antimicrobial peptide with multiple biological functions. In the current study, the tissue-specific mRNA expression of PR-39 was investigated in Chinese Jinhua pigs, and the effect of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) expressing F4ac (K88ac) fimbriae challenge on the mRNA expression of PR-39 in various tissues was compared between Jinhua and Landrace pigs. The three most stable expressed housekeeping genes were validated before evaluating PR-39 expression. PR-39 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the bone marrow compared with the spleen, thymus, MLN, liver and ileum. The ETEC F4ac challenge could up-regulate PR-39 mRNA expression in both Jinhua and Landrace pigs, but the changes were different between the two breeds. Jinhua pigs responded more strongly to ETEC F4ac challenge than did Landrace pigs, because the interaction between the breed and challenge significantly impact PR-39 mRNA in the thymus, liver and ileum. The PR-39 mRNA expression levels of challenged Jinhua pigs were significantly higher in the spleen, thymus, liver, ileum and MLN compared with challenged Landrace pigs. These differences in the mRNA expression of PR-39 could be a result of genetic differences in the resistance to ETEC F4ac infection between the two breeds, but this speculation requires further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84904915345	Probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis Bi-07 alleviates bacterial translocation and ameliorates microinflammation in experimental uraemia	Aim Uraemia is characterized by intestinal bacterial translocation, which contributes to the development of microinflammation. Probiotics enhance the intestinal barrier and overall health of the host. The present study investigated whether the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis Bi-07 alleviates bacterial translocation and ameliorates microinflammation in experimental uraemia. Methods Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of 20 rats each: the sham group, which underwent only laparotomy; the uraemia group, which underwent 5/6 nephrectomy; and the uraemia + probiotic group, which underwent 5/6 nephrectomy and daily intragastric administration of B. animalis subsp. Lactis Bi-07 for 4 weeks. Bacterial translocation was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene from oral GFP-labelled Escherichia coli in the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Intestinal permeability, plasma inflammatory biomarker levels, and endotoxin levels were measured. Jejunum, ileum, and colon specimens were removed for histological examination. Results Uraemic rats exhibited a significantly higher incidence of bacterial translocation (70%) than did sham rats (10%). Probiotic treatment resulted in a decrease in bacterial translocation (20%). Intestinal permeability, inflammatory biomarker levels, and endotoxin levels in uraemic rats were significantly higher than those in the sham group. After treatment with the probiotic, inflammatory biomarker levels significantly decreased. Uraemic rats demonstrated superficial mucosal erosion and inflammatory cell infiltration in the small intestine, and administration of the probiotic alleviated these lesions. Conclusion The probiotic B. animalis subsp. Lactis Bi-07 alleviate bacterial translocation and ameliorate microinflammation through the recovery of intestinal mucosal integrity. © 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

84920194759	Mechanism of delayed frost growth on superhydrophobic surfaces with jumping condensates: More than interdrop freezing	Delayed frost growth on superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) with jumping condensates has been found by many researchers recently. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, copper SHSs with or without jumping condensates were selected as the substrates for observing condensation icing at a relative humidity (RH) of 60%. The results showed that only SHS with jumping condensates showed delayed condensation icing. Moreover, when such SHSs were placed upward and the surface temperature was held at -10 °C, some discrete frozen drops first appeared on the SHSs. The following icing mainly occurred on these discrete global crystals and then expanded around them until covering the entire surface. Little macroscopic interdrop freezing phenomenon was found. The growth of the frost front is mainly dominated by jumping freezing (the condensed droplets jumped onto the ice crystals and were frozen) or direct vapor-ice deposition. Using microscopy, we found interdrop freezing occurred, in addition to the two mechanisms mentioned above. By placing the SHS downward at -10°C and intentionally introducing or eliminating tiny dusts, we confirmed that there were no superhydrophobic defects on our SHSs. The discrete frozen drops first appearing on the SHSs were triggered by tiny dusts falling on the surface before or during condensation icing. The key approach in delaying or resisting frost growth on SHSs with jumping condensates is to retard initial ice crystal formation, e.g., eliminating the edge effect and keeping the SHSs clean.
