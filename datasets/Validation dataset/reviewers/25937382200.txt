14544272438	Solubilities of disperse dyes of blue 79:1, red 82 and modified yellow 119 in supercritical carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide	Dissolution of disperse blue 79:1, red 82, and modified yellow 119 with supercritical carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide was studied at 393.2 K and 30 MPa over a wide range of contact times. Equilibrium solubilities of the dyestuffs in the supercritical fluids were also measured at temperatures from 353.2 to 393.2 K and pressures up to 30 MPa. The solubilities were enhanced generally about 100-fold as pressure increasing from 15 to 30 MPa. Under the same equilibrium condition, the solubilities of the dyes in carbon dioxide followed the order of red 82>blue 79:1>modified yellow 119, and modified yellow 119 is more soluble in nitrous oxide than in carbon dioxide. The solubility data were correlated with the Chrastil, the Sung-Shim, and the Mendez-Santiago-Teja models. The Chrastil model correlated the solubility data to about within the experimental uncertainty. The correlated results of the Mendez-Santiago-Teja model endorsed the consistency of the solubility data over the entire experimental conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The saturated vapor compositions were correlated with the density of the light components. Henry's constants of the gases dissolved in cyclohexanol were calculated with the aid of the Krichevsky-Ilinskaya equation. The new VLE data were also correlated by the Peng-Robinson and the Patel-Teja equations of state. In general, the Patel-Teja equation incorporating the one-fluid, two-parameter van der Waals mixing rule yielded the best representation.

Henry's constants were calculated from the isothermal equilibrium data. The new VLE data were correlated by the Patel-Teja equations of state with three different types of mixing rules.

0032021774	Viscosity calculations with the aid of an equation of state	The excess activation free energy of flow as defined in the Eyring model was calculated from the excess Gibbs free energy of mixture multiplied by a proportionality factor, in which the excess Gibbs free energy of mixture was estimated from the Patel-Teja equation of state with zero binary interaction constant. It was found that the proportionality factor could be treated as a constant for a nonaqueous system, whereas the factor was considered as a linear composition-dependent (LCD) function for an aqueous system (or a strongly hydrogen-bonded system). Promising results have been obtained from the proposed method to correlate viscosity data for a wide variety of nonaqueous and aqueous mixtures. These model parameters could be estimated from a limited knowledge of mixture viscosity data; one point for a nonaqueous system and two data points for an aqueous system.

The Tait equation correlated accurately the density data. Isothermal compressibilities of hexadecane and the mixtures were then calculated with the aid of the Tait equation. The excess volumes of m-xylene + hexadecane are positive over the entire experimental conditions. The isothermal excess volumes of tetralin + hexadecane are negative at 333 K and 373 K but were found to vary from positive to negative with increasing tetralin mole fraction at 413 K.

The solubility of helium in 1-alkanols, as evidenced by the experimental results, is enhanced by increasing both pressure and temperature. Over the investigated conditions, the saturated gas-phase composition of the 1-alkanol component decreases with an increase of pressure at a constant temperature.

Excess volumes were found to be negative in blending poly(ethylene glycol)s with poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether). The pressure effect on the liquid densities was represented accurately by the Tait equation, which was used to calculate isothermal compressibilities for the oligomers and the oligomeric blends.

While the first four substances are model compounds of wash oil, which has widely been used as a solvent to remove aromatics from coal oven gas, diphenylmethane is a high-boiling and low-melting compound that is a potential additive to modify the performance of wash oil. Each of the seven binaries appears to be a simple eutectic system, as evidenced by the experimental results.

No azeotropes were found. While the tert-butanol-containing systems exhibited positive deviations from Raoult's law, the morpholine-containing systems showed negative deviations.

Experimental results revealed that all the binaries behave as simple eutectic systems. The eutectic loci were also observed for the mixtures of 4-methoxyphenol+catechol+p-cresol, from which a ternary solid-liquid equilibrium phase diagram was obtained.

3042978109	Cubic perturbed hard-chain equation of state for nonpolar and polar fluids	The cubic perturbed hard-chain equation of state is extended to calculate the volumetric properties (vapor pressure, vapor volume and liquid volume) for real fluids. This equation was developed on the basis of perturbation theory in which the reference repulsion was represented by a hard-sphere and a hard-chain in combination with a square-well attraction as a perturbation. The expression for each segment of the equation approximated the results from computer simulation of molecular theories of fluids, but as a whole is explicit in pressure and third order in volume. With modification of the potential parameters to depend on temperature, the equation was found satisfactory to describe the PVT behavior of real fluids for a diversity of nonpolar, polar and hydrogen-bonded substances over entire range of experimental conditions. The calculated results from other equations of state are also reported for comparison.

3242709793	Square-well chain molecules: A semi-empirical equation of state and Monte Carlo simulation data	A semi-empirical equation of state was developed for square-well chain fluids on the basis of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data. The equation was formed by combining terms describing non-bonded square-well segments, hard-sphere chain formation, and a perturbation term describing the square-well contribution to chain formation. The functional dependence on the chain length is the same as that derived in the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT). Extensive isobaric-isothermal MC simulations were performed for the dimer, 4-mer, 8-mer, and 16-mer square-well fluids at temperatures below or near the critical point. The new equation satisfactorily represents the volumetric properties of square-well chain fluids, up to and including the 100-mer, which was the longest chain length studied. Additionally, the new model accurately reproduces the phase envelopes of the dimer and 4-mer fluids, however, it underestimates the vapor pressures for 8-mer's and above. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The shape of the pigment's primary particles is rod-like with the minor axis length ranging from 50 to 80 nm and the major axis length from 200 nm to 1.0 μm. As evidenced from Section 2.3, moderate concentrations of pigment solution, moderate pressures, and higher temperatures can effectively reduce the mean particle size. The precipitation kinetic parameters were determined from the particle size distributions with the aid of the population balance theory. The secondary nucleation was found to be dominant in the precipitation and diffusion may govern particle growth. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The VLE data were determined experimentally for binary mixtures of propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME) + propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) and acetic acid + PGME. A minimum pressure azeotrope exhibits on each isotherm of acetic acid + PGME. The VLLE data were also measured for water + PGMEA and water + PGMEA + PGME. The VLLE data could be correlated well by the NRTL and the UNIQUAC models accompanied with the Hayden-O'Connell (HOC) correlation for water + PGMEA over a wide temperature range as linearly temperature-dependent parameters were adopted. The NRTL-HOC model, together with the parameters determined from the phase-equilibrium data of the constituent binaries, predicted reasonably well the binodal curves of water + PGMEA + PGME. By adjustment of six parameters simultaneously, the NRTL-HOC and the UNIQUAC-HOC models correlated satisfactorily the ternary VLLE properties of water + PGMEA + PGME. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33645530724	Control of reactive distillation columns for amyl acetate production using dilute acetic acid	This work explores the feasibility of recovery of acetic acid from aqueous solutions with different acid concentrations. Instead of separating acid from water using azeotropic distillation, acetic acid is converted to acetate via esterification. A range of acetic acid concentrations is explored, varying from 100 wt%, to 75 wt%, to 50 wt%, and then to 30 wt%. The Total Annual Cost (TAC) analysis shows that a standalone reactive distillation is more economical than a flowsheet with a pre-treatment unit. Process characteristics have been explored and the results show significant nonlinearity associated with reactive distillation columns for all four different acid concentrations. A systematic design procedure is devised to control reactive distillation columns by temperature control. Reasonable control performance can be achieved. A further improvement can be made by incorporating feedforward control for feed flow disturbance. Finally, one-temperature-one composition control structure is also examined. Acceptable control performance can be obtained while maintaining acetate composition.

33645674170	Control of different reactive distillation configurations	Three different flowsheets have been proposed for acetic acid esterification of acetic acid with alcohols ranging from Cl to C5 according to the ranking of normal boiling points and immiscibility. This work explores the similarities and differences in the dynamics and control of these three types of flowsheets. The degree of process nonlinearity is analyzed qualitatively based on the residue curve map and the boiling point ranking and it can be computed quantitatively based on the fraction of "sign reversal" for all tray temperatures or based on Allgower's nonlinearity measure. These measures provide useful information to the potential problems in closed-loop control. Next, a systematic design procedure is proposed to devise control structures for all three types of flowsheets for these five esterification systems. The simulation results reveal that reasonable control can be achieved for all five systems with different degrees of asymmetry in closed-loop responses as predicted by the nonlinearity measures. Dual-temperature control and one-temperature/one- composition control are studied. Simulation results clearly show that the simple decentralized control provides a workable solution for highly nonlinear reactive distillation columns under various flowsheet configurations. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

While the excess volumes are positive in acetophenone + PEG-200 over the entire composition range, those are found to change from positive to negative with increasing the mole fraction of the solvent in acetophenone + PEGME-350. The pressure effect on the liquid densities can be represented accurately by the Taitequation. Moreover, an empirical equation with two characteristic parameters correlates well the PVT data over the entire experimental conditions for each binary system.

33845390750	Design and control of reactive distillation for ethyl and isopropyl acetates production with azeotropic feeds	Reactive distillations for the production of ethyl acetate (EtAc) and isopropyl acetate (IPAc) are classified as the type-II process where the first column consists of a reactive zone and a rectifying section followed by a stripper [Tang et al., 2005. Design of reactive distillations for acetic acid esterification with different alcohols. A.I.Ch.E. Journal 51, 1683-1699]. Instead of using pure alcohols and acetic acid as reactants, this paper studies the effects of reactant purity on the design and control of reactive distillation. This offers significant economical incentives (by reducing raw materials costs), because ethanol forms an azeotrope with water at 90 mol% and isopropanol/water has an azeotrope at 68%. The purities of the acid is set to 95% for acetic acid (industrial grade), 87% for ethanol, and 65% for isopropanol. The results show that the total annual costs (TAC) increase by a factor of 5% for EtAc and 8% for IPAc production using reactive distillation. Next, the operability of the reactive distillations with azeotrope feeds is explored. Three disturbances, feed flow, acid feed purity, and alcohol feed composition, are introduced to assess control performance using dual-temperature control and one-temperature-one-composition control. Simulation results indicate good control performance can be achieved for reactive distillation with azeotropic feeds. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several experimental parameters were investigated to explore their influences on the morphology and the mean size of the products. These parameters included the character of carbon dioxide injector, precipitation pressure and temperature, anti-solvent density, the polymer concentration, the flow rate of feed, and the nature of organic solvents. The phase states of the mixtures of solvent + anti-solvent in precipitation stage may govern the mean size of the resulting particles. Nanoparticles of mCOC were obtained in the homogeneous compressed liquid or supercritical region, while sub-micrometric particles were formed in the vapor-liquid coexistence region. The morphology of precipitates was also significantly changed, turning from spherical nanoparticles to microfibrils, as the polymer concentration of feed was increased from 2 to 4 wt.%. Under 15 MPa and 306.2 K, the mean size of the resultant primary mCOC particles as small as 39 nm with a standard deviation of about 6 nm could be produced. The residual solvent was about 1.6 wt.% in the sample after SAS processing by analyzing with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and the particle samples exhibited sub-glass transition behavior according to the thermal histograms of differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Pigment Green 36 were prepared using a continuous supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) apparatus employing quinoline as solvent and supercritical carbon dioxide as anti-solvent. A series of precipitation experiments were conducted at different temperatures, pressures, and flow rates of pigment solution. The vapor-liquid phase boundaries of carbon dioxide + quinoline mixtures were also measured with a volume-variable phase equilibrium analyzer at temperatures from 308.2 K to 328.2 K. Mapping the estimated composition of mixtures in a model CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) precipitator at the end of injection of pigment solution onto the phase diagram found that the morphology of prepared particles was mainly governed by the phase behavior of anti-solvent + solvent mixtures. Nano-particles were obtained as the precipitation loci were manipulated within either supercritical or superheated vapor region through the SAS process, whereas micro-metric aggregated ball-like particles were produced as the precipitation loci passed by the vapor-liquid coexistence region. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These systems showed slightly positive deviations from the ideal solution behavior without any azeotrope formation. Additionally, the saturated pressures of dimthyl adipate, dimethyl glutarate, methanol + adipic acid, and methanol + water + adipic acid were also determined experimentally in a temperature range of (323.15 to 463.15) K. While the new binary VLE data were correlated with the NRTL-HOC and the UNIQUAC-HOC models, respectively, to determine the optimal values of the model parameters, the saturated pressure data of the ternary system were used to test the validity of the VLE prediction by using the parameters determined from solid-liquid equilibrium data. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

Saturated solubilities of the disperse dyestuff in supercritical carbon dioxide with or without cosolvent were also measured over the temperature and pressure ranges of 353.2 K to 393.2 K and 15 MPa to 30 MPa. Either ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide, up to 5 mol%, was used as a cosolvent. As evidenced from the experimental results, the magnitudes of equilibrium solubility can be effectively enhanced in the presence of both two cosolvents. Dimethyl sulfoxide was found to yield higher solubility enhancement. Cosolvent effects were discussed on the basis of the Kamlet-Taft solvatochromic solvent parameters of cosolvents. The saturated solubility data were correlated with the Chrastil and the Mendez-Santiago and Teja equations.

0033384478	PVT of fractionation cuts of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propylene glycol) from 298 K to 338 K and pressures up to 30 MPa	PVT data are measured for ten fractionation cuts of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) at temperatures (298-338) K and pressures up to 30 MPa. The range of number-average molecular weights for these polymer cuts is from about 210 to 4960. The Tait equation represents accurately the effect of pressure on the liquid densities. Isothermal compressibilities for each polymer cut can be calculated with the aid of this equation. The experimental results reveal that the density of PEG increases with the average molecular weight but an opposite dependence is found for PPG. Nevertheless, the densities become insensitive to molecular size when the molecular weights of PEG are greater than 420 and those of PPG are greater than 3420. These new PVT data are correlated with both the FloryOrwoll-Vrij and the Schotte equations of state. The characteristic parameters of the models so determined appear to depend on the molecular weight of polymers. Copyright ©1999 The Society of Chemical Engineers.

0034253755	Fundamental study of the phase behavior of wash oil with diphenyl ether	Diphenyl ether is a potential modifier to decrease the melting temperatures of wash oils and thus to prevent solid formation from the recycled stream in an aromatics removal process. Fundamental study of the solid-liquid equilibria for the related mixtures was undertaken in the present work. Solid-liquid equilibrium data were measured for binary and multicomponent mixtures containing model compounds of wash oils (acenaphthene, dibenzofuran, fluorene, and phenanthrene) and diphenyl ether. The results showed that adding diphenyl ether substantially lowered the melting points of wash oils. A series of batch distillations with various initial feeds were also made to investigate further the property changes of the wash oils before and after recovery. It was found that diphenyl ether could still remain in the residues (the recovered wash oils) and changes in the melting temperature of oils were minor. These low-melting wash oils can be recycled directly to benzol scrubber for reuse. The binary solid-liquid equilibrium data were correlated with the NRTL model. The solution model with the determined parameters is capable of predicting the solid-liquid equilibrium temperatures of the pseudo-binary (multi-component) system to an AAD of 0.3%.

The materials investigated in the present study included the CDs of cyclo(Gly-Gly), cyclo(Ala-Gly), cyclo(Ala-Ala), cyclo(Leu-Ala) and cyclo(Val-Val), the osmolytes of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), sarcosine, betaine, proline and sucrose, and the denaturant of GdnHCl. In this series of measurements, the aqueous samples were prepared with various concentrations of the CDs, up to saturated conditions, and as a function of osmolyte or GdnHCl concentrations. The density increments resulting from the addition of the osmolyte or GdnHCl and different model compounds of CDs were investigated, respectively. An empirical linear combination equation with an augmented term to account the interactions between CDs and osmolyte or GdnHCl was used to quantitatively correlate the experimental densities over the entire concentration ranges. The addition of this augmented term significantly improved the correlation of the density data for those systems which were not accurately represented by the linear combination equation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

39049164345	The influence of phase behavior on the morphology of protein α-chymotrypsin prepared via a supercritical anti-solvent process	Ultra-fine particles of α-chymotrypsin were produced with a supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) technique by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent and carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. According to the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) phase diagram of DMSO + carbon dioxide, the precipitation experiments have been conducted in different phase regions, including supercritical, superheated vapor, and vapor-liquid phase coexistence zones. It was found that the phase behavior of the mixtures during precipitation governed the product's morphology. Uniform networked nano-particles were obtained as the precipitation was implemented in the supercritical region. The uniformity of the resulting products became worse when the particles were precipitated around the critical region. Irregular micro-scale aggregated particles were formed in the superheated region, while both dense cake and spherical clusters were produced in the vapor-liquid coexistence region. A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model was applied to calculate the dynamic composition variations of mixtures in precipitator during the particle formation process. The crystalline and thermal property of the original and the SAS processed samples were analyzed by a wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), respectively. No significant changes were found after SAS treatment. Besides, the biological activity of the SAS processed α-chymotrypsin was retained in a range of 30-75% of the original protein. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

3342974761	Pressure-volume-temperature properties for 1-octanol + acetophenone, poly(propylene glycol) + 1-octanol + acetophenone, and poly(ethylene glycol) + poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether) + anisole	Pressure-volume-temperature (P-V-T) properties were measured for 1-octanol + acetophenone, the polymer solutions of poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) with the mixed solvents of 1-octanol and acetophenone, and the polymer blends of polyethylene glycol) (PEG)/poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether) (PEGME) with anisole at temperatures from 298.15 K to 348.15 K and pressures up to 50 MPa. The Tait equation represents accurately the pressure effect on the liquid densities over the entire pressure range. The experimental-specific volumes of the constituent binary systems were correlated with the Flory-Orwoll-Vrij and the Schotte equations of state to determine the binary interaction parameters. By use of these determined binary parameters, the equations of state predicted the specific volumes to average absolute deviations of better than 0.13% for the ternary mixtures composed of PPG with the mixed solvents and the polymer blends of PEG/PEGME with anisole.

0034310793	Kinetics of catalytic esterification of acetic acid and amyl alcohol over dowex	The kinetic behavior of the heterogeneous esterification of acetic acid with amyl alcohol over an acidic cation-exchange resin, Dowex 50W μl8-100, was investigated. The experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures from 323 to 393 K and at molar ratios of feed (amyl alcohol to acetic acid) from 1 to 10. The equilibrium conversion of acetic acid was found to increase with increasing reaction temperature. A water-rich phase (the second liquid phase) appeared in the reacting mixture when the feed composition was close to stoichiometric. Gas bubble formation was observed when the reaction temperature was as high as 393 K. The kinetic data were correlated with the quasi-homogeneous, Langmuir-Hinshelwood, Eley-Rideal, and modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood models. The modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood model yielded the best representation for the kinetic behavior of the reaction over wide ranges of temperature and feed composition.

0034310796	Simultaneous chemical and phase equilibria for mixtures of acetic acid, amyl alcohol, amyl acetate, and water	Phase compositions of simultaneous chemical and phase equilibria are measured with a static apparatus for the multicomponent system of acetic acid, amyl alcohol, amyl acetate, and water at temperatures from 373.15 to 393.15 K. Various molar ratios of acetic acid to amyl alcohol of feed, ranging from 1:3 to 3:1, are employed in the experiments. An acidic cation-exchange resin, Amberlyst 39, is used to promote the esterification. In addition, vapor-liquid equilibrium data are also determined for the binary mixtures of acetic acid + amyl alcohol at 333.15 K and acetic acid + amyl acetate at 353.15-393.15 K. These new binary data are applied to determine the binary parameters of the NRTL model for the corresponding systems that are needed for prediction of the multicomponent systems. By accounting the dimerization of acetic acid in the vapor phase, the reliability of the binary parameters obtained from different types of equilibrium data is evaluated by comparing the results of equilibrium calculations with the experimental phase compositions of the esterification system.

The dissolution rates of these three dyestuffs were compared. Equilibrium solubilities were also measured over the temperature and pressure ranges of 353.2-393.2 K and 15-30 MPa. As evidenced from the experimental results, the solubilities increase dramatically with increasing pressure and are not as sensitive to temperature. The magnitudes of the solubilities are in the sequence of disperse blue 79 > disperse yellow 119 > disperse red 153 as pressures higher than 20 MPa.

The experiments were conducted at temperatures from 313.2. K to 343.2. K and the molar ratios of feed (methanol to acid) at 15 and 20. The reaction rate was found to increase with increasing temperature, but the equilibrium conversions of adipic acid were almost identical over the entire temperature range; that is, the heat effect of this reaction system was minor. It was also found that the equilibrium conversion of adipic acid increases slightly as the molar ratio of feed increasing from 15 to 20. The experimental results showed that the mass-transfer resistance could be neglected over the range of experimental conditions. The kinetic data were correlated with two quasi-homogeneous models.

Three cases of plantwide RD processes with large recycle flow rates are used to illustrate the application of the design principals. The cases are hydrolysis of methyl acetate, transesterification of methyl acetate and esterification of adipic acid. The design principles produce workable control structures for the three systems. Temperature and temperature-composition control structures can deal with the two major disturbances: changes in the feed flow rates and reactant composition.

In the presence of ethanol, from (1 to 5) mol%, the gas-solid equilibrium data of the Disperse Red 82 and modified Disperse Yellow 119 in supercritical carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide have been measured at temperatures from (353.2 to 393.2) K and pressures from (15.0 to 30.0) MPa. The experimental results show that the solubility increases substantially, up to (9 to 25)-fold, by adding 5 mol% of ethanol to the supercritical fluids. In the presence of cosolvent ethanol, the solubility enhancements in nitrous oxide system are much greater than that in carbon dioxide system for modified Disperse Yellow 119 at the same temperature and pressure. The solubility data were correlated with the Chrastil and the Méndez-Santiago and Teja models. The Méndez-Santiago and Teja model yields slightly better results than Chrastil model.

The influences of various experimental factors on the morphology and the mean size of particulate products were investigated. As evidenced from the experimental results, phase behavior of the mixtures in precipitator during the particle formation stage played a crucial role in the SAS processes. Uniform networked nano-particles were obtained when the precipitations were conducted in the supercritical region of carbon dioxide + DMSO mixture. Several different types of morphologies were produced simultaneously as the precipitations were operated near the critical region. Spherical micron-scale clusters were formed in the superheated vapor region, while submicron-particles were aggregated as dense cake when lysozyme precipitated in the vapor-liquid coexistence region. The wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns indicated that both the raw lysozyme and the processed particulate samples were amorphous. The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) thermograms showed that the dehydration peak was disappeared after SAS treatment. Moreover, the networked primary particles could be disintegrated and dispersed well in water through ultrasonication, which were confirmed by analysis with dynamic laser scattering (DLS). A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model was used to calculate the dynamic composition variations of the mixtures in precipitator during the particle formation period. © 2008.

Similarities and differences between these two flowsheets have been identified. Both the diacid esterification reactions are catalyzed heterogeneously by an acidic ionexchange resin, and reaction kinetics can be described using quasihomogeneous model. The UNIFAC method predicts suitable NRTL parameters for calculating liquid activity coefficients, which give a good description of experimental data. Results show that the plantwide flowsheets need a large recycle ratio for the light key reactants and ester products could be achieved with a purity of 99 mol%.

The influences of various processing parameters on the characteristics of the resultant particles were investigated. The experimental results revealed that the product's morphology closely correlated with the phase behavior of the mixtures in the precipitator during particle formation stage. Networked nanospheroids with narrow particle size distribution were produced when the precipitation was operated in either the compressed liquid region or in the supercritical region. However, the particulate products became less uniform as the precipitation was implemented near the critical region. While microspheroids were obtained as the precipitation was conducted in the superheated vapor region, dense films together with microparticles were formed in the vapor-liquid coexistence region. The untreated ceftazidime and the SAS precipitated samples were characterized with wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR).

The N-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (TAPS) and N-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-amino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (TAPSO) are useful zwitterionic buffers for pH control as standard buffers in the physiological region of pH 7.7 to 9.1 for TAPS and 7.0 to 8.2 for TAPSO, respectively.

65249112694	Osmolyte counteracts urea-induced denaturation of R-chymotrypsin	The stability of proteins is reduced by urea, which is methylamine and nonprotecting osmolyte; eventually urea destabilizes the activity and function and alters the structure of proteins, whereas the stability of proteins is raised by the osmolytes, which are not interfering with the functional activity of proteins. The deleterious effect of urea on proteins has been counteracted by methylamines (osmolytes), such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), betaine, and sarcosine. To distinctly enunciate the comparison of the counteracting effects between these methylamines on urea-induced denaturation of R-chymotrypsin (CT), we measured the hydrodynamic diameter (dH) and the thermodynamic properties (Tm, ?H, ?GU, and ?Cp) with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), respectively. The present investigation compares the compatibility and counteracting hypothesis by determining the effects of methylamines and urea, as individual components and in combination at a concentration ratio of 1:2 (methylamine:urea) as well as various urea concentrations (0.5-5 M) in the presence of 1 M methylamine. The experimental results revealed that the naturally occurring osmolytes TMAO, betaine, and sarcosine strongly counteracted the urea actions on R-chymotrypsin. The results also indicated that TMAO counteracting the urea effects on CT was much stronger than betaine or sarcosine. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

78651515149	Kinetics of heterogeneous esterification of glutaric acid with methanol over Amberlyst 35	The kinetic behavior of heterogeneous esterification of glutaric acid with methanol over acidic cation-exchange resin beads, Amberlyst 35, was investigated through a packed-bed reactor. The experiments were conducted at temperatures from 313.2. K to 333.2. K and the molar ratios of feed (methanol to glutaric acid) at 15 and 20. The reaction rate was found to increase with increasing temperature, but the equilibrium conversions of glutaric acid were almost identical over the entire temperature range; that is, the heat effect of this reaction system was minor. It was also found that the equilibrium conversion of glutaric acid increases slightly as the molar ratio of feed increases from 15 to 20. The experimental results showed that the mass-transfer resistance could be neglected over the range of experimental conditions. The kinetic data were correlated with two quasi-homogeneous models. The model parameters were determined and their applicability was discussed. © 2010 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

The kinetic experiments were conducted at temperatures from 313.15 to 333.15 K, and molar ratios of methanol to propionic acid in the feed stream from 1 to 5. The reaction rate was found to increase with increasing temperature, but the equilibrium conversions of propionic acid changed only slightly over the entire range of reaction temperatures indicating that the heat effect of this reaction is minor. It was also found that the equilibrium conversion of propionic acid increases with the molar ratios of feed increasing from 1 to 5. The relative adsorption strength between any two reacting species was determined from the results of binary adsorption experiments. The magnitude of adsorption strengths follows the order of water > methyl propionate > propionic acid > methanol. The kinetic data were correlated with the ideal-quasi-homogeneous (IQH), the nonideal-quasi- homogeneous (NIQH), the Eley-Rideal (ER), and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen- Waston (LHHW) models, respectively, to determine the kinetic parameters for each model.

The experimental results revealed that a 1:1 adducted compound formed in 1,4-butanediol + catechol, whereas 1,4-butanediol + 4-methoxyphenol remained a simple eutectic system. The eutectic loci were further investigated for the mixture of 1,4-butanediol + catechol + 4-methoxyphenol, from which a ternary solid-liquid equilibrium phase diagram was obtained. A feasible separation sequence, on the basis of the phase diagram, was then proposed to separate the eutectic mixture of 4-methoxyphenol + catechol by means of extractive crystallization with 1,4-butanediol as an auxiliary agent. Both the ideal-chemical model and the regular solution-chemical model were applied to correlate the experimental data of the binary systems. The regular solution-chemical model with the determined parameters predicts the equilibrium temperatures of the ternary system to a grand average absolute deviation of 1.24%.

The solubilities of these buffers were determined in binary mixtures (1,4-dioxane + water) and (ethanol + water) at T = 298.15 K by using the results of density measurements. It has been observed that MOPS induced liquid-liquid phase splitting for the mixtures of 40% to 90% (w/w) 1,4-dioxane in water. The two-liquid phase formation was visualized with disperse orange 25. The phase equilibrium boundaries, including the regions of one liquid, two liquids, (one liquid + one solid) and (two liquids + one solid), for the (MOPS + water + 1,4-dioxane) system have been determined experimentally at T = 298.15 K. The tie lines of the (liquid + liquid) equilibrium were also measured. The Othmer-Tobias and Bancroft equation were used to evaluate the reliability of the tie-line data. The binodal curve was fitted to an empirical equation and the effective excluded volume (EEV) model. The apparent free energies of transfer (ΔGtr′) of MOPS and MOPSO from water to 1,4-dioxane and ethanol solutions have been calculated from the solubility data. These ΔGtr′ values were compared with those of some related biological buffers (TRIS, TAPS, TAPSO, and TABS).

80455173370	Interactions of biological buffers with macromolecules: The ubiquitous "smart" polymer PNIPAM and the biological buffers MES, MOPS, and MOPSO	Proteins are practically never in a buffer-free solution. We therefore studied the effects of some important biological buffers 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), and 3-morpholino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (MOPSO) on the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), an isomer of polyleucine, as a model compound for protein. The results from dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed that the LCST of PNIPAM aqueous solutions were decreased significantly with increasing the buffer concentration, due to the presence of the buffers destroying the hydration structures and subsequent aggregation of PNIPAM. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics calculations, these buffers are highly polar compounds and, therefore, strongly interact with water molecules, causing buffering out of PNIPAM. The buffer's affinity to water follows the order MOPS > MES > MOPSO. The LCST values determined from DLS follow the order MOPSO > MOPS ≈ MES. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) reveal that no direct binding between the buffer and the polymer occurs but interacts with the first hydration shell of the polymer. In comparing with the MOPS buffer, the unexpected effects on the PNIPAM were found in the MOPSO-containing system due to MOPSO has one more OH group. This group interacts with water clusters around the hydrophobic isopropyl groups, which changes the hydration state of the polymer. It also should be noted that the phase transition in the presence of buffers is similar to those observed with kosmotropic salts and sugars (protein stabilizers) in terms of lowering the LCST and the dehydration of PNIPAM groups. Such favoring of the compact globule state observed at high buffer concentrations will provide a protective effect against denaturation of globular proteins. The interactions of the studied buffers with bovine serum albumin (BSA) have been investigated and found that these buffers stabilized BSA, based on DLS, FTIR, and UV-vis absorption studies. The present study will act as a key for the lock of buffer and macromolecule mechanism. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The effects of several key factors on the particle size were investigated. These factors included the inside diameter of capillary tube, concentration of the pigment solution, the flow rate of the solution, and temperature, pressure and density in the precipitator. The experimental results showed that smaller inside diameters of capillary tube, lower concentrations of pigment solution, lower densities but higher than the critical values of mixtures of carbon dioxide + DMSO are favorable to produce smaller particles for pigment red 177.

The phase boundary data were fitted to an empirical equation relating to the concentrations of organic solvent and buffer. The effective excluded volume (EEV) values of EPPS were obtained from the phase boundary data. The phase-separation abilities of the investigated aliphatic alcohols were discussed. The reliability of the experimental tie-lines was satisfactorily confirmed by the Othmer-Tobias correlation. The experimental tie-lines data for the ternary systems have been correlated using the NRTL activity coefficient model. The separation of these aliphatic alcohols from their azeotropic aqueous mixtures is of particular interest to industrial process. The addition of the EPPS as an auxiliary agent breaks the (1-propanol + water) and (2-methyl-2-propanol + water) azeotropes.

The phase diagrams of (acetonitrile + water + EPPS) and (acetone + water + EPPS) systems showed that the phase separation takes place in a wide range of the organic solvent mass fractions, 0.25 < w < 0.95. The solubility limits of EPPS buffer before the phase separations were determined by densimetry. The (liquid + liquid) equilibrium (LLE) and (solid + liquid + liquid) equilibrium (SLLE) data were measured for these ternary systems at T = 298.15 K under atmospheric pressure. The EPPS can be used as an auxiliary agent to pass over the (acetonitrile + water) azeotrope. The phase boundary data of the different specific regions in the phase diagrams were fitted to an empirical equation and the effective excluded volume (EEV) model. The experimental LLE data (tie-lines) were found to be thermodynamically consistent according to Othmer-Tobias equation.

The new phase equilibrium data were correlated with several cubic equations of state with the van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules. Generally the Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state with two binary interaction parameters yielded the best results. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

0037684808	Liquid-liquid equilibria for ternary mixtures of water + ethanol with 1-hexanol, butyl propionate, or ethyl caproate	Liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) data were measured for the ternary mixtures of water + ethanol + 1-hexanol, water + ethanol + butyl propionate, and water + ethanol + ethyl caproate at atmospheric pressure over a temperature range of 283.15 K to 323.15 K. All three ternary systems exhibit type I behavior of LLE. The area of the two-phase region decreases with increasing temperature for each ternary system; its magnitude follows the order of the mixtures containing ethyl caproate > butyl propionate > 1-hexanol. The NRTL and the UNIQUAC models correlated the LLE data very well, except for the region near the plait point. The NRTL model is generally better than the UNIQUAC model for representing the LLE behavior for the three investigated systems.

0037834881	Pressure-volume-temperature properties for binary and ternary polymer solutions of poly(ethylene glycol), poly(propylene glycol), and poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether) with anisole	Pressure-volume-temperature properties were measured for polymer solutions of poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) + anisole, polymer blends of PPG + poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether) (PEGME), and the blends of PPG + PEGME and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) + PPG with anisole at temperatures from 298.15 to 348.15 K and pressures up to 50 MPa. The Tait equation represents accurately the pressure effect on the liquid densities over the entire pressure range. The excess volumes change from positive to negative as increasing the mole fraction of PPG in the binary systems of PPG + anisole and PPG + PEGME. The volumetric data of the related binary systems were correlated with the Flory-Orwoll-Vrij and the Schotte equations of state to determine the binary parameters. By using these determined binary parameters, both equations predicted the specific volumes of the polymer blends with anisole to average absolute deviations of better than 0.13%. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0037999887	Separation of closely boiling compounds of 2-methoxyphenol and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene with diphenylmethane as entrainer	Solid-liquid equilibrium data were measured for binary and ternary mixtures composed of diphenylmethane with closely boiling compounds: 2-methoxyphenol (or guaiacol, CAS [90-05-1]) and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene (or veratrole, CAS [91-16-7]). Experimental results revealed that all the binaries behave as simple eutectic systems. The eutectic loci were also observed for the mixtures of diphenylmethane + 2-methoxyphenol + 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, from which a ternary solid-liquid equilibrium phase diagram was obtained. A feasible separation sequence, on the basis of the phase diagram, was then proposed to separate the mixture of 2-methoxyphenol and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene by means of extractive crystallization with diphenylmethane as an entrainer. The Wilson and the NRTL models were employed to correlate the equilibrium data of binary systems. These two models with the determined parameters predicted the solid-disappearance temperatures of the ternary system to grand average absolute deviations of better than 0.43%.

84872127423	Interruption of hydration state of thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in guanidinium hydrochloride	In this article, we investigate the effect of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on the phase transition temperature of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) in aqueous solution with the aid of fluorescence spectroscopy, viscosity (η), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Temperature dependent fluorescence intensity measurements have been employed successfully to determine the conformational change of PNIPAM through evaluating the Gibbs free energy changes. Additionally, direct hydrogen bonding formation between GdnHCl and PNIPAM has been confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements at various concentrations of GdnHCl. The intermolecular interactions were also studied in terms of amide I band analysis, which reveals the interruption of hydrated coil conformation of PNIPAM. The degree of destabilization of PNIPAM progressively increases with increasing concentration of the denaturant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84872571756	Phase behavior and molecular dynamics simulation studies of new aqueous two-phase separation systems induced by hepes buffer	Here, for the first time, we show that with addition of a biological buffer, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), into aqueous solutions of tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxane, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, tert-butanol, acetonitrile, or acetone, the organic solvent can be excluded from water to form a new liquid phase. The phase diagrams have been determined at ambient temperature. In order to understand why and how a zwitterion solute (HEPES) induced phase separation of the investigated systems, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies are performed for HEPES + water + THF system. The MD simulations were conducted for the aqueous mixtures with 12 different compositions. The reliability of the simulation results of HEPES in pure water and beyond the phase separation mixtures was justified by comparing the densities obtained from MD with the experimental values. The simulation results of HEPES in pure THF and in a composition inside the phase separation region were justified qualitatively. Interestingly, all HEPES molecules entirely aggregated in pure THF. This reveals that HEPES is insoluble in pure THF, which is consistent with the experimental results. Even more interestingly, the MD simulation for the mixture with composition inside the phase separation region showed the formation of two phases. The THF molecules are squeezed out from the water network into a new liquid phase. The hydrogen bonds (HBs), HB lifetime, HB Gibbs energy (ΔG), radial distribution functions (RDFs), coordination numbers (CNs), electrostatic interactions, and the van der Waals interactions between the different species have been analyzed. Further, MD simulations for the other phase separation systems by choosing a composition inside the two liquids region for each system were also simulated. Our findings will therefore pave the way for designing new benign separation auxiliary agents. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84872304831	Buffering-out: Separation of tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane, or 1,4-dioxane from their aqueous solutions using EPPS buffer at 298.15 K	Buffering-out phase separation technique was performed to obtain 98.01 wt.% of tetrahydrofuran (THF), 96.63 wt.% of 1,3-dioxolane, and 94.85 wt.% of 1,4-dioxane from their aqueous solutions using a biological buffer. The phase separation was carried out at room temperature under atmospheric pressure; and the biological buffer is 3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propanesulfonic acid (EPPS). The solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE), liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE), and solid-liquid-liquid equilibrium (SLLE) data have been measured for EPPS + tetrahydrofuran + water, EPPS + 1,3-dioxolane + water, and EPPS + 1,4-dioxane + water systems. Phase diagrams were then constructed for these new phase separation systems. The solubility mass fractions were fitted to an empirical equation as a function of the cyclic ether and buffer concentrations. The effective excluded volume (EEV) model was applied to the solubility mass fractions as well in order to evaluate the phase-separation ability of the investigated cyclic ethers. The consistency of the LLE tie-line data was verified with the Othmer-Tobias correlation. For the process simulations purpose, these experimental tie-line data were also correlated satisfactorily with the NRTL activity coefficient model. The NRTL binary interaction parameters of the investigated systems were reported. By taking advantage of the buffering-out effect, a conceptual process flowsheet for recovery of the cyclic ethers from their aqueous solutions was proposed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84879940245	TES buffer-induced phase separation of aqueous solutions of several water-miscible organic solvents at 298.15 K: Phase diagrams and molecular dynamic simulations	Water and the organic solvents tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxane, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, tert-butanol, acetonitrile, or acetone are completely miscible in all proportions at room temperature. Here, we present new buffering-out phase separation systems that the above mentioned organic aqueous solutions can be induced to form two liquid phases in the presence of a biological buffer 2-[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino] ethanesulfonic acid (TES). The lower liquid phase is rich in water and buffer, and the upper phase is organic rich. This observation has both practical and mechanistic interests. The phase diagrams of these systems were constructed by experimental measurements at ambient conditions. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed for TES + water + THF system to understand the interactions between TES, water, and organic solvent at molecular level. Several composition-sets for this system, beyond and inside the liquid-liquid phase-splitting region, have been simulated. Interestingly, the MD simulation for compositions inside the phase separation region showed that THF molecules are forced out from the water network to start forming a new liquid phase. The hydrogen-bonds, hydrogen-bonds lifetimes, hydrogen-bond energies, radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, the electrostatic interactions, and the van der Waals interactions between the different pairs have been calculated. Additionally, MD simulations for TES + water + tert-butanol/ acetonitrile/acetone phase separation systems were simulated. The results from MD simulations provide an explanation for the buffering-out phenomena observed in [TES + water + organic solvent] systems by a mechanism controlled by the competitive interactions of the buffer and the organic solvent with water. The molecular mechanism reported here is helpful for designing new benign separation materials. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84879202432	Isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium for binary systems of toluene+o-xylene, benzene+o-xylene, nonane+benzene and nonane+heptane at 101.3kPa	Isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for the binary systems of toluene. +. o-xylene, benzene. +. o-xylene, nonane. +. benzene and nonane. +. heptane were measured at 101.3. kPa by using a modified Othmer still. The thermodynamic consistency of these new VLE data was checked by using the point to point test of Van Ness. No azeotrope was found in these binary systems investigated. While nonane. +. benzene were found to have large positive deviation, toluene. +. o-xylene, benzene. +. o-xylene, and nonane. +. heptane exhibited large negative deviation from ideal behavior. The binary interaction parameters of the Wilson, the NRTL, the UNIQUAC models and the SRK equation of state for these four binary systems were determined through the VLE data reduction. These new VLE data were compared with the predicted values from the UNIFAC and the COSMO-RS (conductor-like screening model for realistic solvents) models as well. Generally, reasonable agreement was found between the predicted results and the experimental values, except for nonane. +. benzene system. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..

84882796801	Vapor-liquid phase equilibrium of carbon dioxide with mixed solvents of DMSO + ethanol and chloroform + methanol including near critical regions	A visual and volume-variable high-pressure phase equilibrium analyzer was used for measuring the vapor-liquid phase boundaries of the ternary systems containing carbon dioxide and mixed solvents of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) + ethanol or chloroform + methanol at temperatures from 298.15 K to 348.15 K over wide composition ranges including near critical points. Four pseudo-binary systems of carbon dioxide plus mixed solvents with constant molar ratios of DMSO/ethanol = 3/7, 5/5, 7/3, and chloroform/methanol = 1/2, were studied in this work. The critical conditions at each investigated temperature were estimated from the experimental isothermal phase boundaries by interpolation. The Peng-Robinson equation of state with the two-parameter van der Waals mixing rules was applied to calculate the phase boundaries. The experimental values were compared with the predicted results from the Peng-Robinson equation using the binary interaction parameters determined from the vapor-liquid equilibrium data of the constituent binaries. The agreement is reasonably well for carbon dioxide + chloroform + methanol, but obvious overestimations are found near the critical regions of carbon dioxide + DMSO + ethanol, especially at higher temperatures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885045024	Vapor-liquid equilibria of binary systems composed of polyoxyethylene 4-octylphenyl ether and alcohols: Experimental measurements and correlation	Isothermal vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data of polyoxyethylene 4-octylphenyl ether (POEOPE) with 2-butanol, tert-butanol, or 1-pentanol have been measured by using an autoclave apparatus. The temperature range is from 321.0. K to 424.5. K and POEOPE content ranging from 0.100 to 0.432 in mole fraction. The raw VLE data were fitted accurately to the Antoine equation. The validity of local composition models, the NRTL and the UNIQUAC, were tested by using the experimental data. It is shown that the VLE data are well represented by using both two models. The UNIQUAC correlates the data slightly better, with an average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 3.3%, while that of the NRTL is 4.7%. Those VLE data were further used to calculate solvent activities and compared with the calculated values from the UNIQUAC and the NRTL models. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84887065714	Interactions of bovine serum albumin with biological buffers, TES, TAPS, and TAPSO in aqueous solutions	The thermal stability of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the aqueous solutions containing the biological buffers, N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2- aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES), N-[tris(hydroxylmethyl)methyl]-3- aminopropanesulfonic acid (TAPS), and N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-amino-2- hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (TAPSO), was studied by using dynamic light scattering (DLS) at various temperatures and concentration ranges of buffers. It is found that the increase of the buffer concentration enhanced the thermal stability of protein BSA, and the stabilization tendency follows the order of TAPSO > TES ≈ TAPS. In this study, we have also investigated the interactions of BSA with TES, TAPS, and TAPSO by using various techniques, such as UV-vis absorption, fluorescence, and molecular docking. It is revealed that the main interactions between the studied buffers and the peptide moieties of proteins are electrostatic including hydrogen bonds. The results obtained from this series of studies confirmed that the biological buffers, TES, TAPS, and TAPSO can serve as good stabilizers for the globular protein BSA, in the aqueous solutions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

0042538919	A cubic perturbed hard-chain equation of state	A cubic equation of state is developed on the basis of perturbation theory. The equation is an association of three segments: the hard-sphere, the hard-chain, and the attraction. The expression for each segment was invoked from approximations of computer simulations of rigorous molecular theories of fluids, but compromised to some extent accuracy and theory for simplicity. This model equation is shown to be potentially capable of describing the PVT behavior of real fluids. As limiting cases, the new equation is reduced to expressions for the hard-sphere and the hard-body fluids. It also represents square-well fluids when the hard-chain contribution is eliminated. The square-well equation was found satisfactory in conforming with the molecular simulation results for square-well fluids and their mixtures.

0343472894	Separation of close-boiling mixtures of 4-methoxyphenol/catechol with tert-butanol	Solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) behavior was observed for close-boiling mixtures of 4-methoxyphenol and catechol with tert-butanol. The experimental liquidus lines of binary systems showed that intermolecular complex compounds were formed in both tert-butanol/4-methoxyphenol and tert-butanol/catechol, implying that tert-butanol is a potential medium to serve as an adductive agent for separation of 4-methoxyphenol and catechol. A ternary SLE phase diagram for the tert-butanol/4-methoxyphenol/catechol system was thus prepared and, based on the diagram, the feasibility of such separation processes was discussed. Furthermore, the binary SLE data were correlated with the ideal-chemical model. The model with the determined parameters from binary mixtures was then applied to predict the equilibrium temperatures for the ternary system.

84896908469	Active and stable liquid water innovatively prepared using resonantly illuminated gold nanoparticles	The properties of confined liquid water, or liquid water in contact with hydrophobic surfaces, are significantly different from those of bulk liquid water. However, all of water's commonly described properties are related to inert "bulk liquid water" which comprises a tetrahedral hydrogen-bonded network. In this work, we report an innovative and facile method for preparing small water clusters (SWCs) with reduced affinity hydrogen bonds by letting bulk water flow through supported Au nanoparticles (NPs) under resonant illumination to give NP-treated (AuNT) water at constant temperature. Utilizing localized surface plasmon resonance on illuminated Au NPs, the strong hydrogen bonds of bulk water can be disordered when water is located at the illuminated Au/water interface. The prepared SWCs are free of Au NPs. The energy efficiency for creating SWCs is ∼17%. The resulting stable AuNT water exhibits distinct properties at room temperature, which are significantly different from the properties of untreated bulk water, examples being their ability to scavenge free hydroxyl and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals and to effectively reduce NO release from lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

K over entire composition range, including the vapor pressures of five constituent compounds. The experimental results of the investigated binary systems show no azeotrope formation and positive deviations from Raoult's law. The thermodynamic consistency of these new binary VLE data has been confirmed by point, area, and infinite dilution tests.

0642287617	Separation of 4-Morpholinepropanesulfonic Acid from Its Aqueous Solution	A conceptual process for separating 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) from its aqueous solution was developed on the basis of the experimental solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) data of MOPS + water and MOPS + methanol. In MOPS + water, a eutectic point was exhibited on the liquidus line and metastable ice was formed at lower temperatures. Due to the poor solubility of MOPS in methanol, methanol was found to be a suitable solvent to removed the residual water adhered to the crude MOPS crystals. The results from data correlation showed that the nonideal phase behavior of these two binary systems could be represented satisfactorily by the NRTL activity coefficient model.

0742286899	Multiphase equilibria for binary and ternary mixtures containing propionic acid, n-butanol, butyl propionate, and water	Isothermal vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data were measured for propionic acid + butyl propionate at 373.15 and 393.15 K, and isothermal vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) data were also measured for n-butanol + water, butyl propionate + water, and water + n-butanol + butyl propionate at temperatures ranging from 323.15 to 393.15 K. No azeotrope was found in propionic acid + butyl propionate. The mutual solubility data of the binary aqueous systems were correlated well with the NRTL model accompanying with temperature-dependent parameters. Improvement on the calculation of saturated vapor compositions has been made by using two-term virial equation with one adjustable binary interaction parameter to represent the non-ideality of the vapor phase. The model parameters determined from the binary VLLE data of n-butanol + water and butyl propionate + water and the binary VLE data of n-butanol + butyl propionate are capable of predicting satisfactorily the VLLE properties for the ternary system of water + n-butanol + butyl propionate. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
