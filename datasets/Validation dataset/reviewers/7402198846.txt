84927713732	Activation-induced necroptosis contributes to B-cell lymphopenia in active systemic lupus erythematosus	B-cell abnormality including excessive activation and lymphopenia is a central feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although activation threshold, auto-reaction and death of B cells can be affected by intrinsical and/or external signaling, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that co-activation of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and B-cell receptor (BCR) pathways is a core event for the survival/dead states of B cells in SLE. We found that the mortalities of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup> and CD19<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> B-cell subsets were increased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE patients. The gene microarray analysis of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells from active SLE patients showed that the differentially expressed genes were closely correlated to TLR7, BCR, apoptosis, necroptosis and immune pathways. We also found that co-activation of TLR7 and BCR could trigger normal B cells to take on SLE-like B-cell characters including the elevated viability, activation and proliferation in the first 3 days and necroptosis in the later days. Moreover, the necroptotic B cells exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction and hypoxia, along with the elevated expression of necroptosis-related genes, consistent with that in both SLE B-cell microarray and real-time PCR verification. Expectedly, pretreatment with the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) inhibitor Necrostatin-1, and not the apoptosis inhibitor zVAD, suppressed B-cell death. Importantly, B cells from additional SLE patients also significantly displayed high expression levels of necroptosis-related genes compared with those from healthy donors. These data indicate that co-activation of TLR7 and BCR pathways can promote B cells to hyperactivation and ultimately necroptosis. Our finding provides a new explanation on B-cell lymphopenia in active SLE patients. These data suggest that extrinsic factors may increase the intrinsical abnormality of B cells in SLE patients.

84930744017	Novel benzenediamine derivative FC99 ameliorates zymosan-induced arthritis by inhibiting RORγt expression and Th17 cell differentiation	Increased IL-17-producing helper T (Th17) cells have been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The retinoic-acid-related orphan nuclear receptor (RORγt) is the master regulator of Th17 cells. Our previous research showed that FC99 possesses anti-inflammation activity. However, to date the effects of FC99 on RORγt expression in Th17 cell differentiation have not been investigated yet. In the present study, we found that FC99 significantly attenuated arthritis-like symptoms, i.e., suppressing the development of paw edema in zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA) mice. H≈E staining showed that the infiltration of inflammatory cells in ankle synovial tissues was significantly suppressed. FC99 also reduced the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ankle synovial tissues as shown by Q-PCR analysis. The protein levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in sera were also suppressed after FC99 treatment. Moreover, FC99 decreased the RORγt mRNA level in spleen tissues. Th17 cell percentage was significantly decreased in spleens and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). The mRNA and protein levels of IL-17A and IL-23 were reduced after FC99 treatment in ZIA mice. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that FC99 inhibited the expression of IL-6 in LPSinduced RAW264.7 cells and BMDCs. Moreover, FC99 significantly inhibited the RORγt expression in PMA-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. These data indicate that FC99 improves arthritis-like pathological symptoms in vivo and in vitro, which might be related to the inhibition of RORγt expression in Th17 cells. Our findings suggest that FC99 may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of RA and other inflammatory disorders.

84930513140	Hyaluronic acid promotes the expression of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 via epigenetic silencing of miR-139-5p in human and rat granulosa cells	Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a serious reproductive dysfunction in which the follicle pool is reduced and depleted. Abnormal apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) is believed to result in follicle loss. Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), which is critical for GC survival, was reported to be reduced in POI patients, but the mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we found that PGRMC1 expression was correlated with the level of hyaluronic acid (HA) in POI patients. HA up-regulated PGRMC1 expression in GCs via suppression of miR-139-5p, which was proven by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assays to target PGRMC1. Consistent with these findings, levels of miR-139-5p were significantly increased and presented an inverse correlation with PGRMC1 in POI patients. Noticeably, HA inhibited CD44-mediated miR-139-5p expression but had no effect on luciferase activity after insertion of miR-139 promoter into luciferase plasmid. Interestingly, miR-139-5p was significantly up-regulated in KGN cells (GC tumor cell line) by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, indicating that HA downregulated miR-139-5p expression via histone deacetylation. Taken together, we report an unrecognized mechanism of HA in the promotion of PGRMC1 expression, suggesting that HA may be a potential molecule for the prevention and treatment of POI.

84933052175	MicroRNA networks in regulatory T cells	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that bind directly to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, resulting in translational repression and/or target mRNA degradation. MiRNAs have been proven to play critical roles on the development, differentiation, and function of immune cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are of importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and self-tolerance. Although many transcription factors and cytokines are known to regulate Tregs, scientists began to focus on the role of noncoding RNA on the regulation of Treg cells. This review provides an overview of the entire microRNA network and specific miRNAs in the development, differentiation, and function of Tregs.

14244267202	The toxic effects of nonylphenol on the reproductive system of male rats	Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to 4-t-nonylphenol (NP) by gavage at dosages of 0, 125 and 250 mg/kg/day for 50 days. Organ weights of liver, kidney, testis and epididymis were measured. Sperm number in the head of epididymis was counted. Several hormones including testosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone were measured. Testicular sections were observed by light and electron microscopy. Terminal dideoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was performed to probe the apoptotic cells in seminiferous tubules. When rats were treated with nonylphenol at 250 mg/kg/day, the absolute and relative weight of epididymis decreased dramatically, while the relative weights of kidney and liver increased by 14 and 22%, respectively. In addition, the sperm density of the head of epididymis and the testosterone level descended at 250 mg/kg/day. The levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone increased in both nonylphenol treated groups. Pathological changes were detected by microscopy and the transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that the number of apoptotic cells in testes increased with nonylphenol in a dose-dependent manner. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1642362442	Effects of Chinese medicinal fungus water extract on tumor metastasis and some parameters of immune function	The effects of the immunomodulation and antitumor metastasis of the Chinese medicinal fungus water extract (FWE) were investigated. After B16 melanoma cells were implanted in C57BL/6 mice through their tail veins, the mice were orally administered by FWE at low dose (160 mg/kg/day) and high dose (400 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. The tumor metastatic foci on the lung surface were observed under dissecting microscope. Phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages was detected through ingesting chicken red blood cells (CRBC) test. Lymphocyte proliferation and the natural killer (NK) cell activity were determined by MTT method and lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH)-release assay, respectively. The expressions of bcl-2 and p53 of livers and lungs were assayed by immunohistochemical method. The results showed that FWE could increase body weights of mice dose dependently. The lung metastasis inhibition rates (MIR) of B16 melanoma cells by low dose and high dose of FWE were 15.5% and 72.7%, respectively. FWE at the two doses enhanced significantly (p<0.05) the phagocytosis, which was evaluated using the phagocytic rate (PR) and phagocytic index (PI). FWE had significantly promoted mice' NK activity at high dose (p<0.001). Lymphocyte proliferation was not significantly elevated in both of low- and high-dose groups. FWE depressed the levels of bcl-2 and p53 protein in the liver and lung cells at both of the two doses. These results indicate that FWE not only promoted the mouse's immunity, but also inhibited tumor metastasis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

22144482044	A novel Spiroplasma pathogen causing systemic infection in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Crustacea: Decapod), in China	A novel disease of crayfish Procambarus clarkii appeared in the summer of 2004 in freshwater aquaculture in Jiangsu province of China. Light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), molecular biological methods and in vitro culture were used to identify the pathogen. The agent was unique in having a helical morphology and rotary motility as observed by phase-contrast light microscopy and was found in haemolymph, muscles, nerves and connective tissues by smear method and TEM. Ultra-thin sections under TEM revealed the wall-free membrane of the microbe. The agent could pass through membrane filters with pores 220 nm in diameter and was cultivated in vitro in M1D medium. 16S rDNA of the crayfish pathogen was amplified by PCR using primers specific for Spiroplasma-specific 16S rDNA. The resultant 271 bp PCR product showed 99% identity with Spiroplasma mirum 16S rDNA, having a close relationship with the spiroplasma from the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. This is the second time a spiroplasma has been found in a freshwater crustacean. The 271 bp PCR product was also amplified from the bottom mud in the ponds associated with the disease. The PCR molecular method is an effective way to detect spiroplasma in freshwater environment. The results from this study are significant in expanding the host range of spiroplasma and freshwater ecology. © 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

22244438559	Ureaplasma urealyticum infection related to seminal plasma immunosuppressive factors, semen pH and liquefaction duration	In this study, semen samples from fertile and unexplained infertile men were explored for relationships between seminal plasma immunosuppressive factors (SPIFs), semen pH, liquefaction duration and infection of ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu). SPIFs activity was measured by way of counteracting complement. PH was detected by exact pH test paper. Liquefaction duration was observed at 37° C. The results showed that Uu infection ratios of semen samples with abnormal SPIFs, pH or liquefaction duration were markedly higher than those of normal semen samples. It is suggested that Uu infection decreases the level of SPIFs, changes the pH in semen and prolongs the semen liquefaction so as to cause spermatic quality decline. The enhancement of SPIFs level may change the male body against Uu infection. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Inc.

22444439463	Microelements in seminal plasma of infertile men infected with Ureaplasma urealyticum	The purpose of this study was to assess the association among male infertility, infection of Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), and microelements in seminal fluid. Semen analysis and cultivation of Uu were carried out on 160 samples of seminal fluid. The concentrations of microelements, such as arsenic (As), molybdenum (Mo), magnesium (Mg), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn) in the samples were measured by an inductively coupled plasma quantometer (ICP). The ratios Cu/Zn and Cd/Zn in the poor spermatic quality group were obviously higher than those in seminal plasma of the group with normal spermatic quality (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), whereas the concentrations of As, Mg, Mo, and Pb showed no difference in the two groups. The ratios Cu/Zn and Cd/Zn and the concentrations of As and Mg in seminal plasma infected with Uu were markedly higher than those not infected with Uu (p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.05, and p<0.05, respectively), whereas the concentrations of Mo and Pb showed no statistical difference. The ratios Cu/Zn and Cd/Zn and the concentrations of As and Mg in seminal plasma of the semen with poor spermatic quality and Uu infection were obviously higher than those not infected with Uu (p<0.05), whereas the concentrations of Mo and Pb showed no statistical difference. Abnormally high ratios Cu/Zn and Cd/Zn as well as an overdose of As were found to be predisposed to Uu infection. Uu infection resulted in an increase of the ratios Cu/Zn and Cd/Zn and the concentrations of As and Mg in seminal fluid, which therefore caused spermatic quality decline. © Copyright 2005 by Humana Press Inc.

23644445470	Immunomodulatory and antitumour effects of an exopolysaccharide fraction from cultivated Cordyceps sinensis (Chinese caterpillar fungus) on tumour-bearing mice	Cordyceps sinensis (Chinese caterpillar fungus) is a fungus parasitic on the larvae of Lepidoptera and has been considered to be a precious tonic food and herbal medicine since ancient times in China. Recently, some fungal strains have been isolated from the fruiting bodies of wild C. sinensis, and some of them have been reported to show the same properties as the natural product. In the present study, an EPSF (exopolysaccharide fraction) was prepared from cultivated C. sinensis and its effects on B16 melanoma-bearing mice were investigated. Three doses of EPSF were intraperitoneally administered every 2 days after the day of tumour-cell injection. The experiment was terminated on day 28. Phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages and proliferation of spleen and thymus lymphocytes were assayed. The tumour metastatic foci on the lung and liver surface were checked. The expression of oncoprotein Bcl-2 in livers and lungs was assayed by a immunohistochemical method. The results showed that EPSF significantly enhanced the Neutral Red uptake capacity of peritoneal macrophages (60 mg/kg, P < 0.01; 120 mg/kg, P < 0.001) and spleen lymphocyte proliferation (60 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 120 mg/kg, P < 0.001) in B16-bearing mouse. The metastasis of B16 melanoma cells to lungs (120 mg/kg) and livers (30, 60 and 120 mg/kg) was significantly inhibited by EPSF. Moreover, EPSF decreased the levels of Bcl-2 in the lungs (120 mg/kg) and livers (30, 60 and 120 mg/kg). These results suggest that EPSF has immunomodulatory function and antitumour activity. © 2005 Portland Press Ltd.

25144506108	RNA interference remarkably suppresses bcl-2 gene expression in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo	Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein. If the level of Bcl-2 protein can be reduced sufficiently in tumors using RNA interference (RNAi) to target the gene message, the apoptosis of tumor cells may be promoted. In this study, we synthesized 19 nucleotides (nts) small interference RNA (siRNA) constructs suppressing bcl-2 gene expression in human tumor cells (HeLaB2 and BGC-823 cell lines) in vitro. The bcl-2 gene expression levels were significantly reduced when these siRNA were transfected into experimental two tumor cells for 72 hours. The apoptosis process was also examined in the tumor cells. Here we synthesized siRNA from a DNA template under the control of the RNA polymerase III promoter in transfected tumor cells. Using this DNA vector-based approach, we found that the siRNA efficiently and specifically inhibited the synthesis of protein encoded by the bcl-2 gene in HeLaB2 and BGC-823 tumor cells. Tumor growth was inhibited by 66.5% with 2mg/kg pSilencer 3.1H1-bcl-2 in mouse liver tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. This approach may prove to be a valuable clinical technique for the analysis of specific gene functions and gene therapy of malignant tumors that utilize the bcl-2 gene via RNA interference. ©2005 Landes Bioscience.

26444621298	Nonylphenol-induced thymocyte apoptosis is related to Fas/FasL pathway	Nonylphenol (NP) is the final biodegradation product of nonylphenol polyethoxylates, which are widely used as surfactants in domestic and industrial products. NP has been reported to have estrogenic activity and shown to have potential reproductive toxicity. However, its influence on immune system function remains unclear. In this study, to determine the immunological effects of NP, the effects of NP on apoptosis and Fas/FasL gene expression in rat thymocyte in vitro were investigated. Thymocytes were treated with NP 0.1, 1, and 10 ppm, respectively. Viable cell numbers were determined by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were identified by DNA fragment analysis. A semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method was used to analyze Fas and FasL mRNA levels. Fas and FasL protein expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. The results showed that NP decreased the cellularity; induced apoptotic death and enhanced the expression of Fas and FasL mRNA as well as proteins in thymocytes. These findings suggest that NP may induce apoptosis by altering the expression of Fas and FasL in thymocytes so as to affect the immune system function. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

27944502986	Effects of 17β-estradiol on the maturation, nuclear factor kappa B p65 and functions of murine spleen CD11c-positive dendritic cells	Physiological gender differences in immune capabilities are now well recognized and suggest that sex steroid hormones such as estrogens may be involved in the regulation of the immunocompetence. In this paper, CD11c-positive murine spleen dendritic cells (SDCs) were treated with various concentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2) for 24 h. The viability, phenotype, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κBp65), endocytosis, stimulatory capacity and cytokine expression were analyzed. Our results showed that E2 increased the viability and MHC-II expression but decreased nuclear NF-κBp65 level and endocytosis of SDCs. E2 also increased the stimulatory capacity of SDCs from low-dose group but decreased it from middle- and high-dose ones. In addition, E2 increased the intracellular expression of IL-6 and IL-10 in SDCs, but no obvious change appeared in IL-12 and TNF-α. These data suggested that E2 might influence the immune responses by changing the viability, maturation, NF-κBp65, endocytosis, stimulatory capacity and cytokine expression of SDCs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

29144460927	Nonylphenol-induced thymocyte apoptosis involved caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial depolarization	Although the effect of 4-nonylphenol on cells of immune system have long been recognized, little is known about the effect of 4-nonylphenol on the induction of apoptosis and related signaling events in the lymphoid cells. In the present study, we used cultured thymocytes of mice to investigate the ability of 4-nonylphenol to induce the apoptosis of thymocytes and to explore the role of signal transduction pathway leading to apoptosis. The results showed that the cytotoxic effects of 4-nonyphenol involved DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder), characteristic of apoptosis. Staining of 4-nonyphenol-treated thymocytes with DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 showed the typical apoptotic nuclei condensation and fragmentation of chromatin. The rates of apoptosis of the 4-nonylphenol-treated thymocytes increased significantly at 4 and 6 h, which were determined by analysis of hypodiploid cells and FITC-Annexin V and PI double staining. Flow cytometer analysis also revealed that the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased activity of caspase-3 occurred concomitantly with the onset of 4-nonyphenol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, a caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk protected thymocytes from apoptosis induced by 4-nonyphenol. These results suggest that 4-nonylphenol induces thymocyte apoptosis via caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial depolarization. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33745931886	Prolactin modulates the functions of murine spleen CD11c-positive dendritic cells	Prolactin (PRL), an anterior pituitary polypeptide hormone, has been shown to have a role in the immunomodulation. Some reports have shown the importance of PRL in activating lymphocytes and macrophages. To further investigate the effect of PRL on the immune system in vitro, murine spleen CD11c-positive dendritic cells (SDCs) were treated with various concentrations of PRL for 24 h, then their viability, phenotype, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κBp65), endocytosis, stimulatory capacity, and cytokine expression were analyzed. The results showed that PRL increased the viability and stimulatory capacity of SDCs, up-regulated the expressions of MHC-11 and CD40 while decreased the level of CD54 on SDCs. Furthermore, PRL decreased the level of NF-κBp65 and the endocytosis of SDCs. In addition, PRL increased the expressions of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α in SDCs. These data suggested that PRL might regulate the physiological and pathological immune responses by changing the viability, phenotype, NF-κBp65, endocytosis, stimulatory capacity, and cytokine expression of SDCs. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that Prog increased the expressions of MHC-II and CD40, stimulatory capacity and intracellular levels of IL-6 and IL-10, while decreased the expressions of CD54 and IL-12, endocytosis and nuclear level of NF-κB P65 of SDCs. These data suggested that Prog may promote the maturation of SDCs and enhance their ability to interact with T cells so as to change the course of autoimmune diseases. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33847374613	Abnormality of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus	Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are key components of the hematopoietic microenvironment and provide support to hematopoiesis and modulate immune system. Several studies suggest that SLE may be seen as stem cell disorders. However, it is unclear that whether MSCs from SLE patients are defective. So in this research, we studied the biological character of bone marrow derived MSCs in patients with SLE, focused on their phenotype (morphology and immunophenotype), karyotype, cytokines expression and hematopoietic support of MSCs. Our results showed that MSCs from SLE patients and normal controls can be successfully culture-expanded, but the MSCs from SLE grew more slowly than those of normal controls (P < 0.05). Cells from both groups were positive for CD29, CD44 and CD105, and negative for CD14, CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR. MSCs from SLE have a normal karyotype. Both groups express IL-6, IL7, IL-11, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) at mRNA level. While IL-6 and IL-7 were down-regulated in MSCs from SLE patient (P < 0.05) at mRNA level. The MSCs from SLE patients and normal controls were infused into ICR (Tac : Icr : Ha strain) mice after high-dose chemotherapy, with no adverse events in either group. Recovery of white blood cells, hemoglobin and platelet was more rapid (P < 0.05) compared with the group without MSCs infusion. We conclude that MSCs in patient with SLE have abnormalities compared with those in normal control. MSCs in patient with SLE may play an important role in the SLE pathogenesis. © 2007 SAGE Publications.

33947365233	Study on the function of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the immunoactive phase of patients with chronic genotype B and C HBV infection	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection induces a wide range of chronic liver injury. The mechanism by which HBV evades the immune surveillance system remains obscure. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) seem to be the major endogenous interferon (IFN)-α producers and represent one of the most important cell types in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity; however, the phenotype and function of pDCs in patients infected by HBV with different genotypes are yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in the numbers and function of peripheral blood pDCs in the immune clearing phase of chronic HBV infection with genotypes B and C. Fifty-six patients with persistent HBV infection were included in this study, with 19 age-matched healthy subjects being used as a control group. The frequencies of pDCs were analysed by flow cytometry, and the IFN-α produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after stimulation with cytidine phosphate guanosine (CpG) oligonucleotides for 24 h was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The genotypes of HBV were detected by polymerase chain reaction and hybridization. The results showed that the frequency and IFN-α-producing capacity of peripheral blood pDCs were dramatically reduced and relatively inversely correlated with the level of serum alanine aminotransferase in both groups of patients with chronic genotype B and C HBV infection. A lower reduction of IFN-α production by CpG-stimulated PBMCs was found in patients with genotype C than in those with genotype B in the phase of immune clearance. In conclusion, the frequency and IFN-α-producing capacity of peripheral blood pDCs were dramatically reduced in the immunoactive phase of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Furthermore, the lower reduction in IFN-α production in patients with genotype C than in those with genotype B may correlate with the outcome of antiviral treatment in CHB patients and the progression of liver inflammation. © 2007 The Authors.

35348852532	siRNA targeting midkine inhibits gastric cancer cells growth and induces apoptosis involved caspase-3,8,9 activation and mitochondrial depolarization	Midkine (MK), a heparin-binding growth factor, is expressed highly in various malignant tumors, so it acts as attractive therapeutic target. In the present study, we used siRNA targeting MK to downregulate human MK expression in human gastric cancer cell line BGC823 and SGC7901 so as to determine the advantages of this anticancer therapeutic. The cell proliferation was evaluated by a WST-8 (4-[3-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1, 3-benzene disulfonate sodium salt) assay and colony formation assay. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometer analysis and colorimetric assay. Our results showed that the BGC823 and SGC7901 cell growth were significantly inhibited by knockdown of MK gene. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into cytosol and increased activity of caspase-3, 8 and 9 occurred concomitantly with inhibition of MK gene. These results indicated that siRNA targeting MK gene can inhibit gastric cancer cells growth and induce apoptosis via mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation. MK siRNA may be a promising novel and potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancers. © 2007 National Science Council.

35848967602	Modulation of 17β-estradiol on the number and cytotoxicity of NK cells in vivo related to MCM and activating receptors	Natural killer (NK) cells are key components of immune systems and their activities could be regulated by sex hormones. In the present study we investigate the effects of estrogen on the number and cytotoxic activity of NK cells in vivo. The number and cytotoxicity of NK cells in four groups (control, sham + vehicle, Ovx + vehicle and Ovx + E2) were determined. The results showed that 17β-estradiol (E2) increased the number of NK cells, but reduced their cytotoxicity. The increase of NK cells proportions by E2 may be mediated by up-regulating the expression of MCM7 and MCM10 proteins, which are required for DNA replication licensing in cell proliferation. The suppressed cytotoxicity of splenic NK cells by E2 may be attributable to the down-regulation of NK cells activating receptors-CD69, NKp46, NKG2DL and 2B4 (CD244), which directly inhibited NK cell activation, resulting in the reduced secretion of the soluble factors-granzyme B and FasL. INF-γ might also act as a negative regulator in the low cytotoxicity of NK cells. In addition, the number of the NK cells is not parallel to their cytotoxicity with a long-term exposure to E2 in vivo. These results suggest that E2-mediated low cytotoxicity of NK cells may regulate host immune response in pregnancy and some female predominant diseases. © 2007.

37349114150	Estrogen distinctively modulates spleen DC from (NZB × NZW) F1 female mice in various disease development stages	Estrogen is important in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The modulation of estrogen on dendritic cells (DCs) may involve in SLE development. Our purpose was to find out whether in vitro the effect of estrogen on DCs is correlated with the disease progression in vivo. We compared the effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) on spleen DCs from SLE murine model-(NZB × NZW) F1 female mice before and after the disease onset. Results showed that E2 changed the surface molecule CD40, cytokines IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNFα and stimulatory ability of spleen DCs from the mice. Selective estrogen receptor modulator-tamoxifen (TAM) could antagonize E2 effects and E2 could influence estrogen receptor (ERα) level in DCs. The changes of DCs from various age old mice were different even contrast. So E2 participates in SLE through modulating DCs by binding ERα. The effects of E2 on DCs from mice in various disease progression stages were different. © 2007.

33645022627	Progesterone regulates mouse dendritic cells differentiation and maturation	Progesterone, an important factor in the maintenance of gestation in humans and animals, has been demonstrated to lower immune response during pregnancy [Siiteri PK, Stites DP, Immunologic and endocrine interrelationships in pregnancy, Biol Reprod, (1982); Watnick AS, Russo RA, Survival of skin homografts in uteri of pregnant and progesterone-estrogen treated rats, Proc Soc Exp Biol Med, (1968)], which is one of many hypotheses trying to explain fetal tolerance. Because dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in the initiation of immune response, we examined the effects of progesterone on the differentiation and maturation of DCs derived from mouse bone marrow cells. Our data suggest that progesterone may be involved in the maternal immune response by modulating DC differentiation, maturation and function. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

40949123519	Isolation, culture and identification of the cells derived from fetal heart	Aim: Fetal heart is in the phase of organ formation and development. Cell amount and proliferation ability are higher than these of adult organs. However, there are few reports on the culture of cells from fetal heart and its biological features. This study established a method of culture the cells derived from fetal heart in vitro and analyzed their basically biological features and sorts. Methods: Experiments were performed at the Medical School & State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing University from October 2005 to May 2007. 1 Ten heart samples obtained from 12-18 weeks of fetus aborted with water bag were provided by Gulou Hospital Affiliated to Medical College of Nanjing University. The parturients and their family members signed the informed consent. Experimental procedures were approved by Hospital Medical Ethical Committee. 2 The heart samples were obtained from 12-18 weeks of fetus aborted with water bag. The samples were digested and cell suspension was prepared. The obtained cells were put into the DMEM/F12 medium including epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, stem cells growth factor, cardiotrophin and 10% fetal bovine serum. 3 The morphology of the cells was observed with a microscope. Their gene expressions were detected by RT-PCR. The immunophenotypes of the cells were analyzed with the flow cytometer before and 19 days after culture. Results: 1 The cells derived from the fetus heart could survive and proliferate. The cells also could form clones after 16 days, and at the central region of clone the cells were round, smaller, and the nuclear was bigger. Surrounding cells were fusiform, and nuclei were polygonal and smaller. The dividing cells could be found under the microscope. 2 RT-PCR showed the expression of c-Kit, KDR, GATA-4, Nkx-2.5 and MEF-2c, other than c-Tnl in the fresh isolated cells. After 19 days, the expressions of GATA-4, MEF-2c, KDR was low, and there was not the expression of c-Kit, Nkx-2.5 and c-Tnl. 3 Flow cytometry showed CD29 and CD44 expressed highly, but the expression of CD45, GATA-4 and c-Tnt was low. Conclusion: A method for culturing human fetal heart-derived cells is successfully established. Mesenchymal stem cells and cardiac progenitor cells exist in the cell populations derived from fetal heart.

77954066474	17β-Estradiol enhances the response of plasmacytoid dendritic cell to CpG	Gender differences in immune capabilities suggest that sex hormones such as estrogens were involved in the regulation of the immunocompetence. Numerous studies also suggest that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) play a pathogenic role in SLE. However, it is unclear whether estrogen can modulate the function of PDCs to influence the development of SLE. In the present study, PDCs from murine spleens were treated with 17b-estradiol (E2) and CpG respectively or both in vitro, then cell viability, costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine secretion of PDCs, as well as stimulatory capacity of PDCs to B cells were analyzed. Results showed that E2 and CpG increased the cell viability and costimulatory molecule expression on PDCs synergistically. Moreover, the intracellular and extracellular secretion of IFN-a was increased by E2 or E2 plus CpG. In addition, E2 and CpG also increased the stimulatory capacity of PDCs to B cells, and the viability of B cells was decreased after neutralizing IFN-a significantly. In the experiments in vivo, mice received daily s.c. injections of E2 and CpG respectively or both, then we found that the plasma concentration of IgM were elevated by E2 and CpG synergistically and the expression of IFN-a/b in spleens were noticeably increased by CpG plus E2 compared with the treatment of E2 or CpG only. This study indicates that E2 could exacerbate PDCs' activation with CpG, which further activates B cells to upregulate susceptibility to autoantigens. IFN-a plays an important role in the stimulatory effect of PDCs on B cells. E2 stimulation of IFN-a production may result in female prevalence in autoimmune diseases such as SLE through activation of PDCs. This study provides novel evidence of relationship between estrogen and SLE and also sheds light on gender biases among SLE patients. © 2009 Li et al.

79951949990	Effect of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in a polyI:C-induced primary biliary cirrhosis mouse model	Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive autoimmune disease of unknown mechanism. We established a PBC animal model by injecting C57BL/6 mice with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium (polyI:C) to investigate the therapeutic effect of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) on this model. After 6 weeks of MSC infusion, serum aminotransferase and autoimmune antibodies declined, and histological examination by hematoxylin and eosin staining showed significant amelioration of monocytes infiltration around bile ducts of mice treated with BM-MSC. Interestingly, allogeneic BM-MSC transplantation markedly increased CD4

80052335469	Targeted inhibition of β-catenin/CBP signaling ameliorates renal interstitial fibrosis	Because fibrotic kidneys exhibit aberrant activation of β-catenin signaling, this pathway may be a potential target for antifibrotic therapy. In this study, we examined the effects of β-catenin activation on tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of the peptidomimetic small molecule ICG-001, which specifically disrupts β-catenin-mediated gene transcription, in obstructive nephropathy. In vitro, ectopic expression of stabilized β-catenin in tubular epithelial (HKC-8) cells suppressed E-cadherin and induced Snail1, fibronectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression. ICG-001 suppressed β-catenin-driven gene transcription in a dose-dependent manner and abolished TGF-β1-induced expression of Snail1, PAI-1, collagen I, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). This antifibrotic effect of ICG-001 did not involve disruption of Smad signaling. In the unilateral ureteral obstruction model, ICG-001 ameliorated renal interstitial fibrosis and suppressed renal expression of fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III, α-SMA, PAI-1, fibroblast-specific protein-1, Snail1, and Snail2. Late administration of ICG-001 also effectively attenuated fibrotic lesions in obstructive nephropathy. In conclusion, inhibiting β-catenin signaling may be an effective approach to the treatment of fibrotic kidney diseases. Copyright © 2011 by the American Society of Nephrology.

41849107494	Estrogen modulates bone marrow-derived DCs in SLE murine model-(NZB x NZW) F1 female mice	Dendritic cells (DCs) in the patient and animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are abnormal, but the detailed mechanism is unclear. Estrogen can modulate DCs in biological condition and estrogen consentration is related to the onset and development of SLE. So the control of estrogen on DCs might lead to the disorder of DCs. To prove the hypothesis, we detected the effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) on bone marrow (BM)-derived DCs in SLE murine model-(NZB x NZW) F1 (NZB/w F1) female mice before and after the disease onset. We found that E2 mainly enhanced the expression of surface molecule CD40, MHCII and the stimulation activity of immature DCs, but weakened the activity of mature DCs. E2 decreased the production of cytokines IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNFα of DCs in young mice, but increased them in old mice. Tamoxifen could antagonize the E2 effect. E2 changed the expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) in DCs. The level of ERα in DCs of various old mice and the differentiation states varied. The results suggest that E2 can modulate the functions of BM-derived DCs in SLE pathology. The modulation is achieved by binding ER. The effects of E2 on DCs are different depending on the progression of SLE and cell differentiation status. This might be due to the difference of ER expression.

42549154929	Lung cancer risk associated with thr495pro polymorphism of GHR in chines population	The incidence of lung cancer has been increasing over recent decades. Previous studies showed that polymorphisms of the genes involved in carcinogen-detoxication, DNA repair and cell cycle control comprise risk factors for lung cancer. Recent observations revealed that the growth hormone receptor (GHR) might play important roles in carcinogenesis and Rudd et al. found that the Thr495Pro polymorphism of GHR was strongly associated with lung cancer risk in Caucasians living in the UK (OR = 12.98, P = 0.0019, 95% CI: 1.77-∞). To test whether this variant of GHR would modify the risk of lung cancer in Chinese population, we compared the polymorphism between 778 lung cancer patients and 781 healthy control subjects. Our results indicate that the frequency of 495Thr (2.%) allele in cases was significantly higher than in controls (OR = 2.04, P = 0.006, 95% CI: 1.21-3.42) which indicated this allele might be a risk factor for lung cancer. Further analyses revealed Thr495Pro variant was associated with lung cancer in the subpopulation with higher risk for lung cancer: male subpopulation, still-smokers subpopulation and the subpopulation with familial history of cancer. In different histological types of lung cancer, Thr495Pro SNP was significantly associated with small cell and squamous cell lung cancer, but not with adenocarcinoma, which suggested a potential interaction between this polymorphism and metabolic pathways related to smoking. The potential gene-environment interaction on lung cancer risk was evaluated using MDR software. A significant redundant interaction between Thr495Pro polymorphism and smoking dose and familial history of cancer was identified and the combination of genetic factors and smoking status or familial history of cancer barely increased the cancer risk prediction accuracy. In conclusion, our results suggested that the Thr495Pro polymorphism of GHR was associated with the risk of lung cancer in a redundant interaction with smoking and familial history of cancer. © The Author (2008).

42149106216	Over-expressed and truncated midkines promote proliferation of BGC823 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo	Aim: To determine whether midkine (MK) and its truncated form (tMK) contribute to gastric tumorigenesis using in vitro and in vivo models. Methods: Human MK and tMK plasmids were constructed and expressed in BGC823 (a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line) to investigate the effect of over-expressed MK or tMK on cell growth and turmorigenesis in nude mice. Results: The growth of MK-transfected or tMK-transfected cells was significantly increased compared with that of the control cells, and tMK-transfected cells grew more rapidly than MK-transfected cells. The number of colony formation of the cells transfected with MK or tMK gene was larger than the control cells. In nude mice injected with MK-transfected or tMK-transfected cells, visible tumor was observed earlier and the tumor tissues were larger in size and weight than in control animals that were injected with cells without the transfection of either genes. Conclusion: Over-expressed MK or tMK can promote human gastric cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and tMK has greater effect than MK. tMK may be a more promising gene therapeutic target compared with MK for treatment of malignant tumors. © 2008 WJG.

4444259386	Dehydroepiandrosterone induces apoptosis of thymocyte through Fas/Fas-L pathway	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the most plentiful steroid hormone, has been convincingly known to have many biological effects and diverse influence in various types of cells, tissues and organs. The effects of DHEA on the humoral and cellular immune response are widely tested, but it is unclear whether DHEA itself serves as an activator of immune function and the literature pertaining to the in vitro effects of DHEA remains contested. In the present paper, the effects of DHEA on the thymocytes in vitro were studied. The results showed that DHEA could enhance the expression of Fas and Fas-L and induce thymocyte apoptosis. This suggests that dehydroepiandrosterone may induce the apoptosis of thymocyte through Fas/Fas-L pathway. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

49949110107	Transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human fetal lung to hepatocyte-like cells	The great shortage of human hepatic cells makes it desirable to generate extrahepatic stem or precursor cells. In recent years, it has been reported that human multipotential mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells. The fetal lung is one of the largest organs containing many MSCs that can be easily obtained. Whether MSCs from fetal lung can differentiate into hepatocytes or bile duct cells is an important issue in basic medicine and clinical application. We isolated fetal lung cells, and expanded and analyzed them. At passage 4, their morphologic, immunophenotyping and cytokine secretions were similar to adult bone marrow-derived MSCs. We conclude that these cells from fetal lung are MSCs, indicating that human fetal lung is an ideal source of hMSCs. hMSCs from fetal lung induced in special differentiation medium showed homogeneous and small polygonal endothelial-like morphology, expressing weak mRNA, as well as Alb and AFP. This implies that hMSCs from fetal lung can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells. © 2008 International Federation for Cell Biology.

We previously demonstrated the functional abnormality of bone marrow derived MSC in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether transplantation of human bone marrow derived MSC affects the autoimmune pathogenesis in MRL/lpr mice. We found that human MSC from healthy donors reduced the proliferation of T lymphocytes from MRL/lpr mice in a dose-dependent fashion. Two weeks after in vivo transfer of MSC, we detected significantly reduced serum levels of anti ds-DNA antibodies and 24 hour proteinuria in MRL/lpr mice as compared with control groups without MSC transplantation. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis revealed markedly reduced number of CD4

65849391010	17β-estradiol suppresses cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity of murine splenic NK1.1 + cells	In order to clarify the effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) on natural killer (NK) cells and the possibly regulatory mechanisms, we obtained highly purified and viable NK cells from C57BL/6J mouse spleen by a magnetic cell sorter (MACS). These cells were treated with E2 and then their cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity were examined. To further investigate the mechanisms on the effect of E2 on NK cells, expressions of activation-associated markers (CD69, CD122) and inhibitory receptors (CD94, Ly49), and intracellular cytokine production were analyzed. At last, we performed the cDNA microarray to explore the possible involved genes. We found that E2 could suppress NK cell cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity in vitro. E2 reduced NK cell cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity, which may be through influencing the phenotypes and cytokine expression of NK cells, mainly involving CD94 and IFN-γ. Furthermore, regulation of Stat4, Fyn, Sh2d1a, Eat2, Cd244, Irf1, Runx1, Irf7, Irf5, Esrra and Nr5a1 genes may be related to the cytotoxicity, proliferation and cytokine production of E2-mediated purified NK cells.

67649604299	Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation reverses multiorgan dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus mice and humans	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that, despite the advances in immunosuppressive medical therapies, remains potentially fatal in some patients, especially in treatment-refractory patients. Here, we reported that impairment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and their associated osteoblastic niche deficiency contribute in part to the pathogenesis of SLE-like disease in MRL/lpr mice. Interestingly, allogenic BMMSC transplantation (MSCT) is capable of reconstructing the bone marrow osteoblastic niche and more effectively reverses multiorgan dysfunction when compared with medical immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (CTX). At the cellular level, MSCT, not CTX treatment, was capable to induce osteoblastic niche reconstruction, possibly contributing to the recovery of regulatory T-cells and reestablishment of the immune homeostasis. On the basis of the promising clinical outcomes in SLE mice, we treated four CTX/glucocorticoid treatment-refractory SLE patients using allogenic MSCT and showed a stable 12-18 months disease remission in all treated patients. The patients benefited an amelioration of disease activity, improvement in serologic markers and renal function. These early evidences suggest that allogenic MSCT may be a feasible and safe salvage therapy in refractory SLE patients. © AlphaMed Press.

68549098097	Down-regulation of TLR9 expression affects the maturation and function of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells induced by CpG	Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is expressed intracellularly by dendritic cells (DCs) and specifically recognizes unmethylated CpG motif. Recognition of TLR9 to CpG DNA can induce DC maturation followed by the subsequent immune responses. Here, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to identify the effect of CpG DNA signaling on DC function. The results showed that transfection of DCs with siRNA specific for TLR9 gene significantly down-regulated TLR9 expression. Immature DCs transfected with TLR9 siRNA did not differentiate into mature DCs with exposure to CpG. TLR9 siRNA-treated DCs expressed low levels of MHC II and CD40 without reducing endocytosis. Furthermore, TLR9 siRNA-transfected DCs exhibited a decreased allostimulatory capacity in a lymphocyte proliferation assay and attenuated Th1 responses by decreasing IL-12p70 production. Our findings indicate that siRNA in silencing TLR9 gene in DCs may offer a potential tool to study the TLR9-CpG pathway. ©2009 Chinese Society of Immunology and University of Science & Technology of China.

70349631644	Differential expression of microRNAs in the placentae of Chinese patients with severe pre-eclampsia	Background: The pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE) is incompletely understood. The placenta is considered to play a key role in this disease. Recent research showed that many microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in human placenta. Our aim in this study was to determine differential expression of miRNAs in placenta with severe PE, and normal placenta. Methods: Differential expression of miRNAs in placenta (four severe PE and a control group of four normal pregnant women) was first screened using microarray analysis. Following this, some differential miRNAs were selected and validated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in placenta from women with severe PE (n=24), and a healthy control group (n=26). Results: We found the following miRNAs were significantly increased in placenta from women with severe PE: miR-16, miR-29b, miR-195, miR-26b, miR-181a, miR-335 and miR-222. Gene ontology analysis of the target genes revealed enrichment for specific biological process categories, i.e., regulation of cellular physiological process including miR-16, miR-29b, miR-195, miR-26b and miR-335, and signal transduction including miR-181a and miR-222. Conclusions: These different miRNAs may play an important role in pathogenesis of PE and may become diagnostic markers for PE. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter.

72349083973	Increased midkine and estrogen receptor-β expression in human non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: Midkine (MK), a new member of the heparin-binding growth factor family, has been found recently to have a high expression level in many tumor specimens including lung carcinoma. Estrogens may be involved in lung carcinogenesis, and estrogen receptors, mainly estrogen receptor-β (ER-β), are present and functional in normal lung and tumor cell lines and tissues. In addition, estrogens and growth factors may promote the progression of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previously, we have immunohistochemically demonstrated that MK and ER-β proteins were overexpressed in NSCLC and their expression levels were both significantly negatively correlated with the pathological classification. The purpose of this study was to further verify their expression and its correlation with NSCLC. Methods: Taking NSCLC tissues and their corresponding paraneoplastic and normal lung as research objects, we further examined the expression of MK and ER-β by meas of RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and Western blot analyses at the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein, respectively. Results: The increased MK and ER-β mRNA expression was found in NSCLC by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses. Furthermore, Western blot analysis also displayed increased expression of MK and ER-β proteins in NSCLC. Finally, their correlation analysis at the levels of mRNA and protein expression in NSCLC demonstrated that MK protein level was significantly correlated to estrogen receptor-β (P<0.01, rs=0.535); in spite of their correlation at the mRNA level, there was no remarkable difference between MK and ER-β (P>0.05, rs=0.178). Conclusion: All these results in the present study confirmed that MK and ER-β were overexpressed in human NSCLC. © 2009 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

The results show that the DNA-binding activities of NF-κB in SDC were higher in Lewis rats than in Fischer rats. Furthermore, in Lewis rats, the increase in NF-κB DNAbinding activities was dose-dependent. However, there is no significant change in SDC of Fischer rats. In Lewis rats, the levels of IL-2 and IL-4 were decreased along with the increase of the concentration of PG-PS while TNF-α was increased. However, there was no obvious change of cytokine expression in Fischer rats in the presence of PG-PS. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the differences in the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB and cytokine production might mediate strain-specific differences of susceptibility to chronic inflammatory stimuli in Lewis and Fischer rats. ©2009 by The Chinese Physiological Society.

77953618993	Peripheral blood dendritic cells and vascular endothelial growth factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma: correlation analysis and in vitro study	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may cause functional deficiency in dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro. The roles of peripheral blood dendritic cells (PBDCs) and VEGF in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are not well understood. The authors analysed the correlation between VEGF and PBDC in 81 OSCC patients. They assessed the effect of VEGF on DC function in vitro. VEGF levels were significantly increased in OSCC patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.05), but PBDC levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05). VEGF expression in TNM I-II (67%) and T1-T2 (74%) was significantly lower, compared with TNM III-IV (88%, P < 0.05) and T3-T4 (89%, P < 0.05). Increased VEGF expression in primary tumours was significantly correlated with elevated serum VEGF levels, but reduced PBDC levels. In vitro cultured DC exposed to VEGF showed significantly decreased expression of functional proteins, enhanced endocytosis activity, and elicited weaker proliferation of T cells, compared with that of free VEGF (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that decreased PBDC and elevated VEGF occur in OSCC patients. Higher VEGF levels may affect precursor cells, resulting in decreased numbers of functional DC. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

77955361735	Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in severe and refractory systemic lupus erythematosus	Objective. Umbilical cord (UC)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown marked therapeutic effects in a number of diseases in animal studies, based on their potential for self-renewal and differentiation. No data are available on the effectiveness of UC MSC transplantation (MSCT) in human autoimmune disease. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of allogeneic UC MSCT in patients with severe and treatment-refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods. We conducted a single-arm trial that involved 16 SLE patients whose disease was refractory to standard treatment or who had life-threatening visceral involvement. All of the patients gave consent and underwent UC MSCT. Clinical changes were evaluated before and after transplantation using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), measurement of serum antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, serum complement C3 and C4, and albumin levels, and assessment of and renal function. Evaluation of potential mechanisms of MSCT effects focused on the percentage of peripheral blood Treg cells and serum levels of cytokines. Results. From April 2007 to July 2009, a total of 16 patients with active SLE were enrolled and underwent UC MSCT. The median followup time after MSCT was 8.25 months (range 3-28 months). Significant improvements in the SLEDAI score, levels of serum ANA, anti-dsDNA antibody, serum albumin, and complement C3, and renal function were observed. Clinical remission was accompanied by an increase in peripheral Treg cells and a re-established balance between Th1- and Th2-related cytokines. Significant reduction in disease activity was achieved in all patients, and there has been no recurrence to date and no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that UC MSCT results in amelioration of disease activity, serologic changes, and stabilization of proinflammatory cytokines. These data provide a foundation for conducting a randomized controlled trial of this new therapy for severe and treatment-refractory SLE. © 2010, American College of Rheumatology.

77955451557	Allogenic mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in refractory systemic lupus erythematosus: A pilot clinical study	Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) in refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: A total of 15 patients with persistently active SLE underwent MSCT. Outcome was evaluated by changes in the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), serological features (anti-nuclear antibodies and antidouble-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)), renal function and percentage of peripheral blood regulatory T cells. Results: From 11 March 2007 to 4 November 2008, 15 patients with persistently active SLE were enrolled and underwent MSCT. The mean follow-up period was 17.2±9.5 months. A total of 13 patients have been followed for more than 12 months. All patients clinically improved following treatment with mesenchymal stem cells with a marked decrease in the SLEDAI score and 24 h proteinuria. At 12-month follow-up, SLEDAI scores decreased from 12.2±3.3 to 3.2±2.8 and proteinuria decreased from 2505.0±1323.9 to 858.0±800.7 mg/24 h (all p<0.05, by paired t test, n=12). At 1-year follow-up in 13 patients, 2 had a relapse of proteinuria, while the other 11 continue to have decreased disease activity on minimal treatment. Anti-dsDNA levels decreased. Improvement in glomerular filtration rate was noted in two patients in which formal testing was performed. Non-renal-related manifestations also improved significantly. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Allogeneic MSCT in patients with refractory lupus resulted in amelioration of disease activity, improvement in serological markers and stabilisation of renal function. MSCT appears beneficial in treatment of patients with SLE refractory to conventional treatment options.

77956179918	Differences in natural killer cell quantification and receptor profile expression in HIV-1 infected Chinese children	Natural killer (NK) cells are believed to play a role in the progression of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) disease, and NK cell levels are reduced in individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection. To assess the effects on quantity of NK cells and the changes of NK cell receptors in HIV-1 infected children via mother-to-child transmission, the percentage of NK cells is quantified and the changes in the NK cell receptor profiles in 20 HIV-1 infected children who are not progressing into AIDS were examined. The results showed that NK cell percentage was decreased in the HIV-1 infected children. The expression of NKp30 on NK cells was increased, while the expressions of CD16, NKp44, NKp46, NKp80, NTB-A, CD244, KIR2D, KIR3DL1 and NKG2D on NK cells were decreased in the HIV-1 infected children. NK cell cytolytic activity was elevated in HIV-1 infected children. These results indicate that the acute changes in NK cell percentage and NK cell receptors in HIV-1 infected children are different from the HIV-1 infected adult individuals. Moreover, serum concentrations of IL-18 were elevated in HIV-infected children compared to HIV-uninfected controls. These differences probably play a role in protecting against transmission of maternal HIV-1 virus and guiding the therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 infected children. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77956547718	tPA is a potent mitogen for renal interstitial fibroblasts: Role of β1 integrin/focal adhesion kinase signaling	Proliferation and expansion of interstitial fibroblasts are predominant features of progressive chronic kidney diseases. However, how interstitial fibroblast proliferation is controlled remains ambiguous. Here we show that tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a potent mitogen that promotes interstitial fibroblast proliferation through a cascade of signaling events. In vitro, tPA promoted cell proliferation of rat kidney fibroblasts (NRK-49F), as assessed by cell counting, cell proliferation assay, and bromode-oxyuridine labeling. tPA also accelerated NRK-49F cell cycle progression. Fibroblast proliferation induced by tPA was associated with an increased expression of numerous proliferation-related genes, including c-fos, c-myc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and cyclin D1. The mitogenic effect of tPA was independent of its protease activity, but required LDL receptor-related protein 1. Interestingly, inhibition of β1 integrin signaling prevented tPA-mediated fibroblast proliferation. tPA rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which led to activation of its downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Blockade of FAK, but not integrin-linked kinase, abolished the tPA-triggered extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 activation, proliferation-related gene induction, and fibroblast proliferation. In vivo, proliferation of interstitial myofibroblasts in tPA null mice was attenuated after obstructive injury, compared with the wild-type controls. These studies illustrate that tPA is a potent mitogen that promotes renal interstitial fibroblast proliferation through LDL receptor-related protein 1-mediated β1 integrin and FAK signaling.

79952043358	Estrogen receptor β signaling regulates the progression of Chinese non-small cell lung cancer	Prospective studies have found that the risk of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has close relationship with estrogen. The effects of estrogens are mediated via two estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms, that is, ER alpha (ERα) and ER beta (ERβ). ERα in NSCLC has been evaluated mostly by immunohistochemistry. However, our previous study showed that ERβ was also highly expressed in Chinese NSCLC. But the roles of ERβ in Chinese NSCLC have not been clarified as yet. So in the present study, two Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, SPC-A1 and LTEP-a2, were used and the role of ERβ in lung tumorigenesis was focused to be investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results showed that over-expressed ERβ can promote the development of NSCLC, while siRNAs targeting ERβ gene can inhibit growth of NSCLC cells and induce apoptosis of these cells via mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation. These results indicated that ERβ plays an important role in development of Chinese NSCLC. This suggests that ERβ deactivation or down-regulation may possess potential therapeutic utility for the treatment of lung cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79951723232	Toll-like receptor 4 can recognize SapC-DOPS to stimulate macrophages to express several cytokines	Objective and design: SapC-DOPS is a newly combined compound consisting of saposin C and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS). Our recent study showed that SapC-DOPS exhibits anti-tumor activity. However, SapC-DOPS has recognition elements of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4;therefore, we want to know whether SapC-DOPS can induce abnormal immunoreaction via identification TLRs. Methods: We investigated the capacity of SapC-DOPS to induce cytokines in vivo and in vitro and analyzed the involvement of TLR and NF-kB in these cytokines production. Results: SapC-DOPS could activate the cytokine production by peripheral macrophages, enhance the expressions of TLR4 and stimulate the NF-κB nuclear translocation. PDTC, an NF-κB inhibitor, could decrease the SapC-DOPS inducible TNF-α and IL-1β production. Conclusions: SapC-DOPS was similar to LPS in the immune response and may induce the production of cytokines in macrophages via the TLR4 signaling pathway and, at least in part, the alteration of the NF-κB pathway. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.

79951802473	Chinese human immunodeficiency virus-1 patients with different routes of transmission exhibit altered expression levels of blood dendritic cell subpopulations	Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). Reduced numbers of blood DCs have been observed in individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection. In the present study, we analyzed the expression levels of monocytes, myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) precursors, mDCs, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), in HIV-1-infected patients in China who were infected via different routes of transmission, including heterosexual and homosexual sexual contact, and blood transmission through importation of blood or blood products, to further elucidate their role in HIV. Compared with HIV-negative individuals (n=40), relative levels of CD11c

79955693261	Increased frequencies of T helper type 17 cells in tuberculous pleural effusion	Th17 cells have emerged as an important mediator in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recent studies suggest a potential impact of Th17 cells on tuberculosis (TB) infection. This study was designed to investigate the possible involvement of Th17 cells in tuberculous pleural effusion. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients with TB had a higher proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Moreover, the percentage of Th17 cells in pleural effusions of TB patients was obviously higher than that in PBMC from TB patients or healthy controls. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-17 and IL-6 were significantly increased in the patients with tuberculous pleural effusion, while expression level of TGF-β was decreased in the pleural effusion. Correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between IFN-γ concentrations and the frequencies of Th17 cells in tuberculous pleural effusion. These results indicate that Th17 cells may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of tuberculous pleural effusion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79955759895	Effect of glossy ganoderma spore oil on human hepatoma cell line HepG2	Objective: To investigate the effect of glossy ganoderma spore oil on human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and its mechanism. Methods: Cell proliferation was measured by cell count kit (CCK-8). The mobility was evaluated by migration assay. Cell apoptotic rate was examined by flow cytometry (FCM). RT-PCR analysis was used to detect mRNA expression of apoptosis related factors Bcl-2, Bax, p53 and Toll like receptors; the cytoskeleton was observed by the immunofluorescent staining. Results: Glossy ganoderma spore oil inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a dose and time dependent manner. The migrating speed of HepG2 cells was reduced. The apoptotic rate of HepG2 cells increased with the elevated concentrations of glossy ganoderma spore oil. The mRNA expressions of VEGF, Bcl-2 and Bax were down-regulated while p53 expression up-regulated. The mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors was also changed by glossy ganoderma spore oil. The cytoskeleton of HepG2 cells was changed, and the pseudopod was decreased, representing the typical apoptosis appearance. Conclusion: Glossy ganoderma spore oil can inhibit the proliferation and the mobility, induce apoptosis of human hepatoma cell line HepG2, change the expression of Toll-like receptors, which may be related to its anti-tumor effects.

79958251750	Stanniocalcin-1 promotes tumor angiogenesis through up-regulation of VEGF in gastric cancer cells	Background: Stanniocalcin-1(STC-1) is up-regulated in several cancers including gastric cancer. Evidences suggest that STC-1 is associated with carcinogenesis and angiogenic process. However, it is unclear on the exact role for STC-1 in inducing angiogenesis and tumorigeneisis. Method. BGC/STC cells (high-expression of STC-1) and BGC/shSTC cells (low- expression of STC-1) were constructed to investigate the effect of STC-1 on the xenograft tumor growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. ELISA assay was used to detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the supernatants. Neutralizing antibody was used to inhibit VEGF expression in supernatants. The expression of phosphorylated -PKCβII, phosphorylated -ERK1/2 and phosphorylated -P38 in the BGC treated with STC-1protein was detected by western blot. Results: STC-1 could promote angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and the angiogenesis was consistent with VEGF expression in vitro. Inhibition of VEGF expression in supernatants with neutralizing antibody markedly abolished angiogenesis induced by STC-1 in vitro. The process of STC-1-regulated VEGF expression was mediated via PKCII and ERK1/2. Conclusions: STC-1 promotes the expression of VEGF depended on the activation of PKCβII and ERK1/2 pathways. VEGF subsequently enhances tumor angiogenesis which in turn promotes the gastric tumor growth. © 2011 He et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79960947941	Involvement of midkine expression in the inhibitory effects of low-frequency magnetic fields on cancer cells	Effects of magnetic fields (MFs) on cancer cells may depend on cell type and exposure conditions. Gene expression levels are different among cancer cells. However, the effect of MFs on cancer cells with different gene expressions is still unclear. In this study, the cancer cell lines BGC-823, MKN-45, MKN-28, A549, SPC-A1, and LOVO were exposed to a low-frequency MF. Specific parameters of MFs were determined. Furthermore, the potential of the MF to influence cancer cell growth with midkine (MK) expression was evaluated. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were detected using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Cell ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. BGC-823 cells with over-expression of MK (BGC-MK cells) and stanniocalcin-1 were generated by plasmid construction and transfection. Results showed that exposure to a 0.4-T, 7.5Hz MF inhibited the proliferation of BGC-823, MKN-28, A549, and LOVO cells, but not MKN-45 and SPC-A1 cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of the MF on BGC-MK cells was lower (12.3%) than that of BGC-823 cells (20.3%). Analysis of the cell cycle showed that exposure to the MF led to a significant increase in the S phase in BGC-823 cells, but not in BGC-MK cells. In addition, organelle morphology was modified in BGC-823 cells exposed to the MF. These results suggest that exposure to a 0.4-T, 7.5Hz MF could inhibit tumor cell proliferation and disturb the cell cycle. The alteration of MK expression in cancer cells may be related to the inhibitory effect of the MF on these cells. Bioelectromagnetics 32:443-452, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc..

79961104904	17β-estradiol induces CD40 expression in dendritic cells via MAPK signaling pathways in a minichromosome maintenance protein 6-dependent manner	Objective The human immune system exhibits sexual dimorphism in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Female sex hormones, including 17β-estradiol, are strongly implicated in the gender bias in SLE. CD40 is a costimulatory molecule and plays a crucial role in modulating the immune response of effector cells. We have previously shown that 17β-estradiol up-regulated CD40 expression and altered minichromosome maintenance protein 6 (MCM6) gene expression in dendritic cells (DCs). The mechanism of the correlation between CD40 and MCM6 in the presence of 17β-estradiol remains unknown. This study was undertaken to elucidate this mechanism and to explain the role of MCM6 in the gender bias in SLE. Methods Bone marrow-derived DCs transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for MCM6 were treated with 17β-estradiol in the absence or presence of CpG. The expression levels of costimulatory molecules, activity of MAPKs, and levels of MCM6 protein were measured. Moreover, the functions of DCs, including proliferation, apoptosis, endocytosis, and cytokine production, were analyzed. In addition, levels of messenger RNA for MCM6 were detected in DCs purified from SLE patients. Results Regardless of the presence or absence of CpG, 17β-estradiol induced CD40 expression via the activation of p38 and JNK, but not ERK. The activation of p38 and JNK enhanced MCM6 expression, which then induced CD40 expression. Suppression of MCM6 in DCs abolished the up-regulation of 17β-estradiol-induced CD40 expression. Importantly, MCM6 expression was significantly increased in SLE patients compared with healthy controls. Conclusion Our findings indicate that 17β-estradiol induces CD40 expression in DCs via p38 and JNK MAPKs in an MCM6-dependent manner. MCM6 may be a critical mediator of sex-based differences in autoimmune disease. Copyright © 2011 by the American College of Rheumatology.

79961132818	Ureaplasma urealyticum infection related to seminal plasma immunosuppressive factors, semen pH and liquefaction duration	In this study, semen samples from fertile and unexplained infertile men were explored for relationships between seminal plasma immunosuppressive factors (SPIFs), semen pH, liquefaction duration and infection of ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu). SPIFs activity was measured by way of counteracting complement. PH was detected by exact pH test paper. Liquefaction duration was observed at 37 °C. The results showed that Uu infection ratios of semen samples with abnormal SPIFs, pH or liquefaction duration were markedly higher than those of normal semen samples. It is suggested that Uu infection decreases the level of SPIFs, changes the pH in semen and prolongs the semen liquefaction so as to cause spermatic quality decline. The enhancement of SPIFs level may change the male body against Uu infection. © 2005 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

80051538326	Glossy ganoderma spore oil promotes apoptosis of human lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A1 through downregulation of miR-21	Objective: To investigate the effects of glossy ganoderma spore oil on the proliferation, apoptosis, expression of miR-21 and its target genes of human lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A1 cell line, and to explore its possible mechanism. Method: The SPC-A1 cells were treated with glossy ganoderma spore oil for 24 and 48 hours. The inhibition growth efficacy was determined using cell count kit (CCK-8). Cell morphological changes were observed by light microscopy. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of miR-21, PTEN and PDCD4 were determined by Real-time PCR. Result: Glossy ganoderma spore oil concentration-dependently inhibited the SPC-A1 cells proliferation. When the concentration of glossy ganoderma spore oil attained to 0.2%, the cells' morphology changed obviously. Glossy ganoderma spore oil could induce the apoptosis of SPC-A1 cells at low concentration. Glossy ganoderma spore oil down-regulated the expression of miR-21 and up-regulated the expression of PTEN and PDCD4 significantly. Conclusion: glossy ganoderma spore oil could inhibit the proliferation obviously and cause the changes of cell morphology. Furthermore, glossy ganoderma spore oil induced apoptosis of SPC-A1 cell through down-regulating the expression of miR-21 and up-regulating tumor suppressors.

83255181885	Chaetoglobosin Fex from the marine-derived endophytic fungus inhibits induction of inflammatory mediators via toll-like receptor 4 signaling in macrophages	Chaetoglobosin Fex (Cha Fex), a cytochalasan-based alkaloid, was isolated from marine-derived endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum QEN-14. The knowledge of its biological function is still limited. We investigated the effects and mechanism of Cha Fex on inflammatory mediators via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR4 ligand, was therefore designed to active TLR4 signaling pathway, and Cha Fex significantly inhibited the LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in peritoneal macrophages and murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detection also found that Cha Fex down-regulated the mRNA expressions of these pro-inflammtory cytokines. Moreover, Cha Fex significantly attenuated the LPS-stimulated degradation of inhibitory kappa B-alpha and the subsequent translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) to the nucleus. Cha Fex also reduced the phosphorylations of extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2). Furthermore, we confirmed that Cha Fex didn't affect LPS binding to the RAW264.7 cells and human monocytes, while Cha Fex was able to inhibit the increase of membrane-associated CD14 (mCD14) expression both on RAW cells and human monocytes induced by LPS to a certain degree. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory property of Cha Fex may be attributed to NF-κB inhibition as well as the negative regulation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 phosphorylations. On the other hand, these inhibitory effects may also be due to the blocking of mCD14 expression. © 2011 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

84859899430	Relative and absolute configuration of vatiparol (1 mg): A novel anti-inflammatory polyphenol	Bioactive natural products offer multiple opportunities for the discovery of novel chemical entities with potential pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and agrochemical applications. Many new organic compounds with novel scaffolds are isolated in small quantities and established methods often fail to determine the structure and bioactivity of such novel natural products. To meet this challenge, we present here a new methodology combining RDC (residual dipolar coupling)-based NMR spectroscopy in microtubes, with a motif-inspired biological assessment strategy. Using only one milligram (ca. 1.5 μmol) of sample, the new protocol established the bioactivity as well as the relative and absolute configuration of vatiparol obtained from Vatica parvifolia. Vatiparol is unique in its unprecedented carbon skeleton and selective inhibitory effect on the expression of monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also known as CCL2). The plausible biosynthetic pathway of vatiparol is briefly discussed. The approach introduced here promises to be widely applicable to the determination of the structure and bioactivity of structurally unknown organic samples available in very limited amounts. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84862816076	Chaeoglobosin Fex inhibits poly(I:C)-induced activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells	Dendritic cells (DCs) are implicated in the induction of autoimmune diseases and exist in lesions associated with several autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Chaeoglobosin Fex (Cha Fex), a cytochalasan-based alkaloid, was isolated from marine-derived endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum QEN-14. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Cha Fex on poly(I:C)-induced bone marrow-derived DCs. The results showed that Cha Fex attenuated the production of IFN-β both at the mRNA and protein level in poly(I:C)-induced DCs. Cha Fex markedly inhibited the maturation and function of the DCs with a reduced capacity to uptake antigens and low level of expression of costimulatory molecules. Moreover, Cha Fex abrogated the ability of poly(I:C)-induced DCs to promotion of T cell proliferation, Furthermore, Cha Fex inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB-α and IRF-3 in poly(I:C)-induced DCs. Cha Fex also reduced the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, without affecting ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that that Cha Fex can exhibit an immunosuppressive effect on mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) via TLR3 signaling, which suggests potential application of Cha Fex in the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862828425	Glucocorticoid Receptor Mediates the Effect of Progesterone on Uterine Natural Killer Cells	Problem: Uterine natural killer cells (uNK) do not express progesterone receptor, but express glucocorticoid receptor (GR). So, we speculate that progesterone may regulate uNK cells through a GR-mediated process. Method of Study: After mouse NK cells were stimulated with CpG with or without IL-12 in the presence or absence pre-treatment of progesterone, the effects of progesterone on NK via GR were investigated by using RU486 (progesterone receptor and GR antagonist) and CDB-2914 (progesterone receptor antagonist). The expressions of CD69 and IFN-γ were determined by flow cytometry and qPCR. Phosphorylation of IκB and STAT4 was determined by Western blot. Furthermore, we purified uNK cells from human decidual tissues using anti-CD56 microbeads to verify the effect of progesterone on uNK via GR. Results: Progesterone suppressed CD69 and IFN-γ expression of mouse spleen NK cells and human uNK cells induced by CpG combined with IL-12. CDB-2914 had no effect on IFN-γ expression suppressed by progesterone, while RU486 could abolish the inhibitory effect of progesterone. In addition, progesterone could decrease the phosphorylation of both STAT4 and IκB. Conclusions: In the present study, we first prove that progesterone can regulate NK cells via GR. It is valuable for further understanding the role of uNK in progesterone regulated gestation process. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84863012833	Ultrathin amorphous alumina nanoparticles with quantum-confined oxygen-vacancy-induced blue photoluminescence as fluorescent biological labels	Ultrathin alumina nanoparticles (NPs) with an average size of less than 4 nm are produced from porous anodic alumina membranes. The alumina NPs in a suspension produce strong blue tunable photoluminescence (PL) with a high quantum efficiency of ∼15% and Stokes shift as large as 1.0 eV. An obvious blue-shift and diminished line width are observed after storing the suspension in air. The tunable blue PL which is closely related to the oxygen vacancy (OV) defect centers at different depths beneath the surface depends on the NP size. The experimental observations are corroborated by theoretical derivation demonstrating that the electron wave functions of the OV-induced defect levels are extended in space, and quantum confinement takes place when the alumina NP is smaller than the spread of the wave functions. It is thus possible to control the PL behavior by changing the NP size and OV depth distribution and the alumina NPs are experimentally demonstrated to be robust and nontoxic biological probes. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84863184433	Lymphocyte subpopulations in Chinese women with Turner syndrome	Purpose Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with deficiency of cellular and humoral immunity. However, the characteristics of lymphocyte subpopulations in Chinese women with TS have not been reported. In this study, the percentage of lymphocyte subpopulations and the mRNA expression of some transcription factors were determined in patients with TS. The effect of the hormone substitution on lymphocyte subpopulations was also analyzed. Methods Thirteen Chinese TS women and eight age and sex-matched healthy volunteers were studied. The percentage and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of lymphocyte subpopulations including CD3+CD4+, CD3+ CD8+, CD19-CD138+, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ and CD4+CD8-IL17A+ cells were determined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of some transcription factors were detected by RT-PCR. Results Compared to control, the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ cells was significantly reduced (p\0.05), while the percentage of CD19-CD138+, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ and CD4+CD8-IL17A+ cells was significantly increased in TS patients. No difference was observed in the percentage of CD3+CD8+, CD19+ B cells between TS patients and healthy volunteers, with the similar changes in the mean fluorescence intensity of these cells. The mRNA expression of some transcription factors slightly enhanced in TS patients. Estrogen therapy did not affect the percentage of lymphocyte subpopulations. Conclusion These findings suggested that Turner syndrome might be associated with changes of lymphocyte subpopulations. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84863298339	Emergence of peripheral CD3+CD56+ cytokine-induced killer cell in HIV-1-infected Chinese children	Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are immune effector cells characterized by co-expression of CD3 and CD56 molecules. We examined the quantities of CIK cells and the changes of these cell expressing NK cell receptors in HIV-1-positive children infected via mother-to-child transmission. The percentage of CIK cells was quantified and the changes in the surface cell receptor profiles in 18 HIV-1-infected children were examined. We found that CIK cell percentages were dramatically increased in HIV-1-infected children. Furthermore, the expressions of CD16, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKp80 and CD244 on CIK cells were decreased, while the expressions of KIR3DL1 and NKG2D on CIK cells were increased in HIV-1-infected children. However, the expressions of KIR2D and NTB-A on CIK cells did not change in the HIV-1-infected children. CIK cells possessed the characteristics of promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and killing functions in HIV-1-infected children. Moreover, serum concentrations of IL-4 and IFN-γ were significantly increased in HIV-1-infected children compared with the HIV-negative controls. These changes likely occurred as a protective mechanism against transmission of maternal HIV-1 virus and thereby helped to limit viral spread, eliminate infected cells and help HIV-1-infected patients to slow the progression to AIDS. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2012.

84863162400	Effect of siRNA-mediated downregulation of VEGF in Tca8113 cells on the activity of monocyte-derived dendritic cells	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a tumor angiogenesis factor that is important in immune regulation. In our previous study, we found that VEGF expression in the peripheral blood and neoplasm nest from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was positively correlated with the course of disease, while an inverse correlation between VEGF expression and dendritic cells (DCs) was identified in the peripheral blood. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether inhibition of human VEGF in the human tongue carcinoma cell line Tca8113 had effects on the activity of monocyte-derived DCs. We knocked down the expression of human VEGF in Tca8113 cells using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique. Tca8113 cells pre-transfected with siRNA targeting VEGF were co-cultured with monocyte-derived immature and mature DCs. Cell proliferation was evaluated by a WST-8 assay. Cell apoptosis, cell cycle and cell phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry. The data revealed that downregulation of the human VEGF significantly inhibited the proliferation of Tca8113 cells and increased apoptosis. Inhibition of human VEGF arrested the cell cycle of Tca8113 cells at the G0/G1 phase. Our results showed that the co-culture of DCs with Tca8113 cells markedly inhibited the expression of the mature markers of DCs including HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, CD40 and CD1a, as well as the immature marker CD83, while inhibition of human VEGF in Tca8113 cells significantly reversed these effects. Therefore, human VEGF in Tca8113 cells may not only regulate the cell proliferation and apoptosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, but may also inhibit DC maturation.

In an in vitro cytotoxicity assay toward the non-small cell lung cancer cell lines of A549 and NCI-H460, 2b showed the stronger activity than 2a, which was confirmed by the morphological test. Mechanistic studies for 2b showed that inhibition of NSCLC cell growth was mediated by G0/G1 cell cycle arrested without the significant apoptosis induction. Furthermore, 2b altered the mRNA levels of CCND1, CCNE1 and PCNA, which were known to control G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Our western blot analysis also showed that 2b-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest was mediated through the decreased expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E1 and PCNA. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84864330589	MicroRNA-181a regulates local immune balance by inhibiting proliferation and immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stem cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit extensive self-renewal potential and can modulate immunocyte activation. Our previous study reported that miR-181a expression was significantly increased in placenta from women with severe preeclampsia (PE), but the mechanisms by which miR-181a regulates MSCs are unknown. In this study, we asked if and how miR-181a regulates MSCs' proliferation and immunosuppressive properties. We found that the expression of miR-181a in the MSCs derived from the umbilical cord and decidua of PE patients increased relative to MSCs derived from normal patients. Transfection with miR-181a oligos prevented MSCs proliferation but did not affect MSCs apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-181a blocked activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway and caused downregulation of target gene (TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1) mRNA and protein expression. Reporter genes with putative miR-181a binding sites from the TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) were downregulated in the presence of miR-181a, suggesting that miR-181a binds to TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1 3′-UTRs. In contrast, transfection of MSCs with miR-181a oligo enhanced expression of IL-6 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by activating p38 and JNK signaling pathways, respectively. MSCs transfected with miR-181a also enhanced the proliferation of T cells in a short-term culture. Additionally, treatment with control MSCs, but not miR-181a transfected MSCs, improved dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis, suggesting that miR-181a attenuates the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs in vivo. Together, our data demonstrate that miR-181a is an important endogenous regulator in the proliferation and immunosuppressive properties of MSCs. © AlphaMed Press.

84865301681	Cell-free microRNA expression profiles in malignant effusion associated with patient survival in non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) expression is altered in cancer cells, and miRNAs could serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for cancer patients. This study was designed to analyze circulating miRNAs expression in the malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and their association with patient survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Pleural effusion from 184 patients with NSCLC and MPE were collected. MiRNA microarray and bioinformatics interpretation were used to evaluate miRNA expression profiles in 10 NSCLC patients with different survival prognosis. Associations were validated in 184 patients (randomly classified into training and validation set with equal number in each group) using quantitative RT-PCR. Risk scores were formulated based on the expression signature of miRNAs. Clinical data, such as patient survival, were collected for correlation analysis. Results: Thirty-three miRNAs were found to be altered more than two-fold by microarray in malignant effusions between longer-survival and shorter-survival groups, and levels of five miRNAs (miRNA-93, miRNA-100, miRNA-134, miRNA-151 and miRNA-345) were significantly associated with overall survival. High expression of miR-100 and low expression of miRNA-93, miRNA-134, miRNA-151 and miRNA-345 were associated with poor survival in both the training and validation cohort. Patients with high risk scores had overall poor survival compared to the patients with low risk scores. Risk score was an independent predictor of patient survival. Conclusions: Expression patterns of miRNAs are systematically altered in MPE of patient with NSCLC. The five miRNA signature from the effusion may serve as a predictor for the overall survival of patients with lung cancers. © 2012 Wang et al.

84864438914	ERβ-mediated estradiol enhances epithelial mesenchymal transition of lung adenocarcinoma through increasing transcription of midkine	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a specific role in the migration of tumor cells. Both estrogen and midkine (MK) have been thought to be important factors in promoting the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and can enhance EMT. Some evidence indicated the correlation between estradiol (E2) and MK, but the precise mechanism on their interreaction is unknown. Here, we try to clarify whether and how E2 regulates MK expression to promote EMT. We found that E2 increased MK mRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells LTEP-a2 and A549 in a time-dependent manner. E2-induced MK expression was inhibited by the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 and tamoxifen but not by phosphoinositide- 3 kinase and MAPK inhibitors, suggesting a genomic mechanism of E2 on the regulation of MK transcription. Moreover, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays exhibited that E2 induced ERβ recruitment to the estrogen response element in the MK promoter. Small interfering RNA to ERα and ERβrevealed that ERβmainly mediated E2-induced MK transcription. Interestingly, E2 enhanced MK expression in accordance with increase of EMT, whereas knockdown of MK could block EMT under E2 stimulation. Importantly, through analyzing lung adenocarcinoma tissues, there was indeed a correlation among levels of E2, MK, and EMT-related protein expression. Taken together, we reported a previously unrecognized mechanism on E2 in the regulation of MK expression and proved that MKplays a pivotal role in progression of E2-regulated EMT. © 2012 by The Endocrine Society.

84866095966	Gene expression profile reveals abnormalities of multiple signaling pathways in mesenchymal stem cell derived from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus	We aimed to compare bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and normal controls by means of cDNA microarray, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting. Our results showed there were a total of 1, 905 genes which were differentially expressed by BMMSCs derived from SLE patients, of which, 652 genes were upregulated and 1, 253 were downregulated. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the majority of these genes were related to cell cycle and protein binding. Pathway analysis exhibited that differentially regulated signal pathways involved actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, tight junction, and TGF- β pathway. The high protein level of BMP-5 and low expression of Id-1 indicated that there might be dysregulation in BMP/TGF- β signaling pathway. The expression of Id-1 in SLE BMMSCs was reversely correlated with serum TNF- α levels. The protein level of cyclin E decreased in the cell cycling regulation pathway. Moreover, the MAPK signaling pathway was activated in BMMSCs from SLE patients via phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK. The actin distribution pattern of BMMSCs from SLE patients was also found disordered. Our results suggested that there were distinguished differences of BMMSCs between SLE patients and normal controls. © 2012 Yu Tang et al.

84866182404	Progesterone Enhances Immunoregulatory Activity of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Via PGE2 and IL-6	Problem: Progesterone (P4) plays a central role in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. It also has profound effects on the regulation of immune responses. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are thought to have the ability to modulate immunocyte activation, are present in human endometrium and deciduas and highly express progesterone receptor (PR). Especially, during pregnancy, both P4 and MSCs are present and regulatively changed at the fetal-maternal interface, but the effect of P4 on the MSCs remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of P4 on the immunomodulatory ability of MSCs and the underlying mechanisms. Method of study: Mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from human umbilical cords. The effects of P4 on the cell morphology, phenotype, proliferation, apoptosis, and expression levels of cytokine and protein were examined. Results: Progesterone did not affect the phenotype, morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis of MSCs, but promoted the production of PGE2 and IL-6 in MSCs. Furthermore, the up-regulation of PGE2 and IL-6 was related to the activation of p38 and NF-κB. Conclusions: Progesterone enhances immunomodulatory function of MSCs through up-regulation of PGE2 and IL-6. The data suggest that P4-regulated MSCs may play a crucial role in modulating the local immune balance of fetal-maternal interface. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84867575701	Midkine upregulates MICA/B expression in human gastric cancer cells and decreases natural killer cell cytotoxicity	Midkine (MK) is a heparin-binding growth factor overexpressed in various human cancers. In the current study, a positive correlation was observed between MK expression and MICA/B serum levels of gastric cancer patients. In addition, MK transfection signiWcantly increased MICA/B expression in gastric cancer cells. The soluble MICA/B expression was also elevated. Furthermore, MK transfection inhibited CD107a and Granzyme B expression, thereby suppressing the natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in vitro. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its promotion of CHOP expression were also observed after MK treatment and transfection. CHOP was indirectly bound to the MICA/B promoter region by interacting with AP-1, leading to MICA/B transcription. Overall, the current study shows that MK expression in tumor cells indirectly suppresses NK cytotoxicity by inducing MICA/B expression and suppressing NKG2D expression. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84868270695	17β-Estradiol enhances response of mice spleen B cells elicited by TLR9 agonist	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nucleic acid-associated antigens. B cells play cardinal roles in SLE. Many evidences have proved estrogen contribute to the gender bias in SLE and 17β-estradiol (E2) could accelerate the disease by regulating B cells. On the other hand, B cells express TLR9 which recognized dsDNA and played a critical role in SLE. However, the crosstalk between estrogen and TLR9 in B cells remains unknown. So we investigated the E2 effect in the presence of the TLR9 ligand CpG on mice spleen B cells. We found that the up-regulation of cell viability, life-span, co-stimulation molecules (CD40, CD86) expression, IgM secretion, TLR9 and MCM6 expression were more significant than CpG ODN or E2 stimulated alone. It may provide a new way to investigate the mechanism of how E2 modulate the B cells function in lupus. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84868566915	Pre-treatment with IL-1β enhances the efficacy of MSC transplantation in DSS-induced colitis	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used experimentally for treating inflammatory disorders, partly due to their immunosuppressive properties. Although interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is one of the most important inflammatory mediators, growing evidence indicates that IL-1β signaling elicits the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs. However, it remains unclear how IL-1β signaling accomplishes this activity. Here, we focus on the therapeutic efficacy of IL-1β-primed MSCs in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model, in addition to the underlining mechanisms. We first found that IL-1β-primed MSCs, without any observable phenotype change in vitro, significantly attenuated the development of DSS-induced murine colitis. Moreover, IL-1β-primed MSCs modulated the balance of immune cells in the spleen and the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) through elevating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-6 and IL-8 expression and influencing the polarization of peritoneal macrophages. Importantly, IL-1β-primed MSCs possessed an enhanced ability to migrate to the inflammatory site of the gut via upregulation of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expression. In summary, IL-1β-primed MSCs have improved efficacy in treating DSS-induced colitis, which at least partly depends on their increased immunosuppressive capacities and enhanced migration ability. © 2012 CSI and USTC.

84870520686	MiR-16 inhibits the proliferation and angiogenesis-regulating potential of mesenchymal stem cells in severe pre-eclampsia	Pre-eclampsia is thought to be a systemic disease of maternal endothelial cell dysfunctions. miRNAs regulate various basic biological functions in cells, including stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells exist in almost all tissues and are the key cellular source for tissue repair and regeneration. Our aims are to investigate whether miRNAs regulate MSCs in fetal-maternal interfaces to influence the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The differential expression of miRNAs in decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells of all patients with severe pre-eclampsia (n = 20) and normal groups (n = 20) was first screened by microarray analysis and validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The integrated bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-16 showed the highest number of connections in the miRNA GO network and the miRNA gene network. Moreover, over-expressed miR-16 inhibited the proliferation and migration of decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells and induced cell-cycle arrest by targeting cyclin E1. Interestingly, over-expression of miR-16 by decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells reduced the ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to form blood vessels and reduced the migration of trophoblast cells. Furthermore, decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cell-expressed endothelial growth factor VEGF-A was involved in migration of trophoblast cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as tube and network formation. Importantly, the levels of cyclin E1 and VEGF-A were negatively correlated with the level of miR-16 expression in decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells from the patients with severe pre-eclampsia. Together, these data suggest that the alteration of miR-16 expression in decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells may be involved in the development of pre-eclampsia. © 2012 FEBS.

84870682228	MicroRNA-29b contributes to pre-eclampsia through its effects on apoptosis, invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells	PE (pre-eclampsia), a pregnancy-specific disorder, is characterized by increased trophoblast cell death and deficient trophoblast invasion and reduced trophoblast-mediated remodelling of spiral arteries. The present study was performed to determine the function of miR-29b (microRNA-29b) in trophoblast cells and its underlying role in the pathogenesisof PE. The prediction of miR-29b target genes was performed using computer-based programs, including Targetscan, Pictar andmiRBase. The function of these target genes was analysed further by gene ontology (GO). The effects of miR-29b on apoptosis, and invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo, BeWo and JAR) were examined by flow cytometryand Matrigel assay respectively. We found that miR-29b induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells. Further studies confirmed that miR-29b regulated the expression of MCL1 (myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1), MMP2 (encoding matrix metallproteinase 2), VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and ITGB1 (integrin β1) genes by directly binding to their 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions). Moreover, we identified that there was an inverse correlation between miR-29b and its target genes in subjects with PE. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for miR-29b in invasion, apoptosis and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells, and miR-29b may become a new potential therapeutictarget for PE. © The Authors Journal compilation © 2013 Biochemical Society.

84873365843	Activated NF-κB in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients inhibits osteogenic differentiation through downregulating smad signaling	Osteoporosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is thought to be the result of accelerated osteoclastogenesis induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the osteoblastogenesis in SLE patients are not fully understood. We investigated the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-induced osteoblastic capacity of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) from SLE patients and the TNF signaling system in determining BMP-2-induced regulatory pathways. It showed that the capacity of osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs from SLE patients was reduced compared with that from healthy controls. The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling was activated while the BMP/Smad pathway was repressed in BMMSCs from SLE patients. TNF activated NF-κB pathway and inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 and BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation in BMMSCs from normal controls, while addition of pyrollidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-κB inhibitor, to SLE-BMMSCs could partially reverse these effects. Thus, our findings have shown that the activated NF-κB pathway in SLE-BMMSCs inhibits the BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation through BMP/Smad signaling pathway, suggesting that the impaired osteoblastic differentiation may participate in the pathology of osteoporosis in SLE patients. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

84873144724	Chaetoglobosin F, a small molecule compound, possesses immunomodulatory properties on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells via TLR9 signaling pathway	Chaetoglobosin F (Cha F), a cytochalasan-based alkaloid, was obtained from the EtOAc extract of a solid culture of Chaetomium globosum IFB-E019. Dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent antigen presenting cells, are considered as the major target in the modulation of excessive immune responses. Recognition of CpG-DNA by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) on DCs is an important step in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. However, the effect of Cha F on the maturation and immunostimulatory function of CpG-stimulated DCs remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of Cha F on bone marrow (BM)-derived DCs. We found that Cha F inhibits the CpG-induced DCs maturation and function by suppressing the expression of surface molecules (CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II), reducing the production of cytokines and chemokines (IL-12 and CXCL-10), inhibiting the CpG-induced DCs-elicited allogeneic T-cell proliferation, and impairing the migration ability to chemokines. The Cha F-treated DCs were highly efficient at Ag capture, via mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis. Additionally, Cha F was also demonstrated to inhibit CpG-induced activation of MAPKs (p38 and JNK, but not ERK) and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and STAT1. Furthermore, we confirmed that Cha F was able to suppress TLR9 expression of CpG-induced DCs. Collectively, these findings provide novel insight into the immunopharmacological functions of Cha F, especially with regard to their impact on CpG-induced DCs. These immunosuppressive properties of Cha F may prove useful in controlling DCs-associated autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

84875319095	Bis-N-norgliovictin, a small-molecule compound from marine fungus, inhibits LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages and improves survival in sepsis	Sepsis is a highly lethal disorder characterized by systemic inflammation, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in macrophages plays a crucial role in modulating innate immune response and outcome of sepsis. During the screening of natural products against inflammation, we identified bis-N-norgliovictin, a small-molecule compound isolated from marine-derived fungus, significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS, ligand of TLR4)-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in RAW264.7 cells. In this study, we evaluated the effect of bis-N-norgliovictin on TLR4-mediated inflammation in mouse macrophages and LPS-induced sepsis model. In RAW264.7 and mouse peritoneal macrophages, bis-N-norgliovictin dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-α, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-β (IFN-β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), but without suppressing cell viability. The anti-inflammatory effect was attributed to the down-regulation of TLR4-triggered myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent and TIR-containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent signaling pathways, including p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) cascades. Importantly, bis-N-norgliovictin also protected mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Intravenous injection of bis-N-norgliovictin 1 h before LPS challenge dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced increases in serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-10, attenuated liver and lung injury and diminished M1 macrophage polarization in liver. Our results demonstrate that bis-N-norgliovictin exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that bis-N-norgliovictin can be a useful therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84876252105	Mechanisms of CpG-induced CD40 expression on murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells	Aberrant CD40 expression by dendritic cells (DCs), induced by microbial stimuli, such as CpG, contributes to the pathogenesis of many human/murine diseases, particularly autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Given the importance of CD40 in these diseases, and the contribution of DCs to the diseases process, it is very important to investigate the mechanisms of CD40 expression induced by CpG on DCs. In this study, we made the observation that CpG-B is a potent inducer on CD40 expression on murine bone marrow-derived DCs. Based on this finding, we undertook an analysis of the molecular basis of CpG-induced CD40 expression on DCs. By using selective inhibitors, it was demonstrated that MAPKs (JNK and p38 MAPK but not ERK) and NF-κB were involved in CpG-induced CD40 expression on DCs. In addition, RNA interference analysis revealed that IRF8 was a key transcription factor in the basal expression of CD40 upon CpG stimulation. Moreover, up-regulating miRNA-146a in DCs effectively decreased CD40 expression by targeting TRAF6 and IRAK1. Thus, our results have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying CpG-induced CD40 expression and DC maturation. © Informa UK, Ltd.

84876409835	Diagnostic and predictive role of cell-free midkine in malignant pleural effusions	Purpose: The detection of circulating nucleic acids has long been explored for the diagnosis and prognosis of a variety of clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to detect the cell-free mRNA expression of midkine (MK) in patients with effusions and its potential diagnostic and predictive value. Methods: Effusions were collected prospectively from 168 patients. The cell-free RNA was extracted from effusions, and the mRNA expression of MK was detected using real-time PCR. The expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and biochemical markers in effusions were also assayed. Primary cancer cells were isolated from the malignant effusions (n = 46). Compared with culture cell lines, the response of these cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents was determined by CCK-8 assay. Results: The expression of cell-free MK mRNA was significantly higher in the malignant group than in the benign group (0.13 vs 0.01, P < 0.001). The sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of MK were 77.5 and 81.5 %, while a combination of CEA and MK reached 86.9 % sensitivity and 88.7 % accuracy. In addition, cell-free MK mRNA expression was significantly correlated with inhibitory rate of cisplatin (R = -0.72, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Measurement of cell-free MK mRNA levels in effusion supernatant yields a high diagnostic accuracy and a potential predictive value. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84885015533	Long non-coding RNA MEG3 inhibits NSCLC cells proliferation and induces apoptosis by affecting p53 expression	Background: Long non-coding RNAs play an important role in tumorigenesis, hence, identification of cancer-associated lncRNAs and investigation of their biological functions and molecular mechanisms are important for understanding the development and progression of cancer. Recently, the downregulation of lncRNA MEG3 has been observed in various human cancers. However, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the expression pattern of MEG3 in NSCLC and to evaluate its biological role and clinical significance in tumor progression. Methods: Expression of MEG3 was analyzed in 44 NSCLC tissues and 7 NSCLC cell lines by qRT-PCR. Over-expression approaches were used to investigate the biological functions of MEG3 in NSCLC cells. Bisulfite sequencing was used to investigate DNA methylation on MEG3 expression. The effect of MEG3 on proliferation was evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays, and cell apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst staining and Flow-cytometric analysis. NSCLC cells transfected with pCDNA-MEG3 were injection into nude mice to study the effect of MEG3 on tumorigenesis in vivo . Protein levels of MEG3 targets were determined by western blot analysis. Differences between groups were tested for significance using Student's t-test (two-tailed). Results: MEG3 expression was decreased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor tissues compared with normal tissues, and associated with advanced pathologic stage, and tumor size. Moreover, patients with lower levels of MEG3 expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Overexpression of MEG3 decreased NSCLC cells proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and impeded tumorigenesis in vivo. MDM2 and p53 protein levels were affected by MEG3 over-expression in vitro. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MEG3 is significantly down-regulated in NSCLC tissues that could be affected by DNA methylation, and regulates NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis, partially via the activition of p53. Thus, MEG3 may represent a new marker of poor prognosis and is a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC intervention. © 2013 Lu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0242412331	In vivo modulation of the circulating lymphocyte subsets and monocytes by androgen	Androgens influence some immunological processes, including alternation of the number and function of the circulating lymphocytes and monocytes. In the present study, the effects of three different doses of testosterone on the numbers and percentages of the peripheral blood cells were investigated; the lymphocyte subsets were determined and the proliferation of lymphocyte was detected. Groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 0.5, 2.5, 12.5 mg/kg or only vehicle, respectively. Compared with controls, the results of complete blood counts showed that the absolute and relative numbers of monocytes decreased. The lymphocyte subpopulations determined by flow cytometry indicated an increase in CD8+ T cells, whereas the CD3+, CD4+ and CD4+CD8+ T cells remained unchanged. Thus, the immunoregulatory index (CD4+/CD8+ ratio) decreased. The proliferative activities determined by MTT assay were down-regulated. In conclusion, the immunosuppressive effects of testosterone may be attributed to a decline in number of monocytes, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and proliferative activities together with an increase of CD8+ T cells in Sprague-Dawley rats. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

84890402540	Allogenic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation ameliorates nephritis in lupus mice via inhibition of B-cell activation	Recent evidence indicates that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) possess immunosuppressive properties both in vitro and in vivo. We have previously demonstrated that transplantation of human MSCs can significantly improve the autoimmune conditions in MRL/lpr mice. The current study aimed to determine the mechanisms by which murine BM-MSC transplantation (MSCT) ameliorates nephritis in MRL/lpr mice. In this study, we found that MSCT can significantly prolong the survival of MRL/lpr mice. Eight weeks after transplantation, MSCT-treated mice showed significantly smaller spleens than control animals, with fewer marginal zones (MZs), T1, T2, activated B-cells, and plasma cells. Moreover, serum levels of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and IL-10 in MSCT-treated mice decreased significantly compared to those in the control group, while levels of serum TGF-β were increased. Notably, decreased BAFF expression in both spleen and kidney was accompanied by decreased production of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and proteinuria in MSCT-treated mice. Since BAFF is mainly expressed by T-cells and dendritic cells, we incubated BM-MSCs and DCs together and found that the production of BAFF by DCs was suppressed by MSCs. Thus, our findings suggest that MSCT may suppress the excessive activation of B-cells via inhibition of BAFF production in MRL/lpr mice. © 2013 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

Study Design Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, miR-155 expression levels were assessed in OSCC cell lines and a cancerous HB cell line. The correlation between miR-155 expression level and clinical parameters was analyzed in 46 patients with OSCC. In addition, the effects of miR-155 on OSCC cell proliferation were evaluated by modulating its expression using an miR-155 mimic and antisense miR-155. Results Significant upregulation of miR-155 was found in OSCC cell lines and in tissues of patients with OSCC. The receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated fair-to-good predictability. Overexpression of miR-155 correlated with the histologic grade (P =.033), and the upregulation of miR-155 enhanced OSCC cell proliferation.

84894521405	The toll-like receptor 3 Ligand, Poly(I:C), improves immunosuppressive function and therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on sepsis via inhibiting MiR-143	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive candidates for clinical therapeutic applications. Recent studies indicate MSCs express active Toll-like receptors (TLRs), but their effect on MSCs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that, after treating human umbilical cord MSCs with various TLR ligands, only TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C), could significantly increase the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, poly(I:C) could enhance MSCs' anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Next, we focused on the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the process of poly(I:C) activating MSCs. Our experiments indicated that miR-143 expression was significantly decreased in MSCs with poly(I:C) treatment, and the expression level of miR-143 could regulate the effect of poly(I:C) on MSCs' immunosuppressive function. Subsequent results showed that the reporter genes with putative miR-143 binding sites from the transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and COX-2 30 untranslated regions were downregulated in the presence of miR-143. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of TAK1 and COX-2 in MSCs was also downregulated with miR-143 overexpression, suggesting that TAK1 and COX-2 are target genes of miR-143 in MSCs. Consistent with miR-143 overexpression, TAK1 interference also attenuated MSCs' immunosuppressive function enhanced by poly(I:C). Additionally, it was shown that TLR3-activated MSCs could improve survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, while miR-143 overexpression reduced the effectiveness of this therapy. These results proved that poly(I:C) improved the immunosuppressive abilities of MSCs, revealed the regulatory role of miRNAs in the process, and may provide an opportunity for potential novel therapies for sepsis. © AlphaMed Press 2013.

84895888693	Mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate Th1-induced pre-eclampsia-like symptoms in mice via the suppression of TNF-α expression	Pre-eclampsia (PE) is thought to be a pregnancy-induced autoimmune disease. Despite several strategies carried out for targeting specific factors relevant to its pathogenesis, PE remains potentially fatal to some patients. Here, we reported a way to isolate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from decidua. The MSCs not only exhibited differentiation and self-renewal capacities, they also possessed immunomodulatory functions and secreted some soluble mediators including IL-6, TGF-β, IDO, VEGF and COX-2. Most importantly, the MSCs were specifically provided with the ability to suppress T cells proliferation by IDO in response to inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Moreover, we developed a Th1 cell-induced PE mouse model which displayed a high level of pathogenesis factor TNF-α. Strikingly, MSCs-based therapy significantly ameliorated both clinical and histopathological severity of PE symptoms including decreasing the blood pressure and proteinuria, suppressing glomerulonephritis, protecting the feto-placental development. The therapy also reversed abnormal TNF-α expression in uterine and splenic lymphocytes. These data suggest that MSCs may ameliorate Th1-induced PE-like symptoms in mice via the suppression of TNF-α and MSCs-based therapy may provide a potential novel method for PE. © 2014 Liu et al.

However, the effect of MF on mechanism of immunological function in tumor-bearing mice is still unclear. Methods: In this study, tumor-bearing mice were prepared by subcutaneously inoculating Balb/c mice with hepatocarcinoma cell line H22. The mice were then exposed to a low frequency MF (0.4 T, 7.5 Hz) for 30 days. Survival rate, tumor growth and the innate and adaptive immune parameters were measured. Results: MF treatment could prolong survival time (n = 28, p<0.05) and inhibit tumor growth (n = 9, p<0.01) in tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, this MF suppressed tumor-induced production of cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G-CSF) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) (n = 9-10, p<0.05 or 0.01). Furthermore, MF exposure was associated with activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, enhanced profiles of CD4

84896309028	FC-98 regulates TLR9-mediated of CXCL-10 expression in dendritic cells via MAPK and STAT1 signaling pathway	Dendritic cells (DCs), as the most potent professional antigen presenting cells, play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune systems. Genomic bacterial DNA mimicked by unmethylated CpG motifs is discovered to possess immunostimulatory effects. CpG-DNA recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) on DCs arouses many immune diseases (such as cancer, viral infection, and autoimmune disorders). In this study we investigated the effects of FC-98 on CpG-induced bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). The results showed that FC-98 significantly inhibited the CpG-induced BMDCs maturation and function by suppressing the expression of surface markers (CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHCII). Moreover, FC-98 downregulated the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10) both at the mRNA and protein level after CpG induction. Meanwhile, FC-98 markedly affected the migration of BMDCs to T cells without affecting their endocytosis capacity. Furthermore, FC-98 was confirmed to decrease CXCL-10 expression by inhibiting CpG-induced activation of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) and STAT1 signaling. Overall, these results suggested that FC-98 was a potential molecule in the treatment of CXCL-10-mediated immune diseases. © 2014 Yonghong Yang et al.

84898896593	Gender differences of B cell signature in healthy subjects underlie disparities in incidence and course of SLE related to estrogen	The aim of the present study was to investigate mechanism of the gender differences of B cells. The results showed that 358 differential gene expressions (DEGs) were displayed between healthy females and males. Compared with male, 226 and 132 genes were found to be up- and downregulated in the female. 116 genes displayed possible correlation with estrogen. Moreover, the upregulated DEGs (Cav1, CD200R1, TNFRSF17, and CXCR3) and downregulated DEGs (EIF1AY and DDX3Y) in healthy female may be involved in gender predominance of some immune diseases. Furthermore, signaling pathway analysis for estrogen-relevant DEGs showed that only 26 genes were downregulated in SLE female versus SLE male, of which expressions of 8 genes had significant difference between SLE females and SLE males but are having nonsignificant difference between healthy females and healthy males. Except for the 5 Y-chromosome-related genes or varients, only 3 DEGs (LTF, CAMP, and DEFA4) were selected and qRT-PCR confirmed that the expressions of LTF and CAMP decreased significantly in B cells from female SLE patients. These data indicated that the gender differences were existent in global gene expression of B cells and the difference may be related to estrogen. © 2014 Hongye Fan et al.

84905496661	A novel benzenediamine derivate rescued mice from experimental sepsis by attenuating proinflammatory mediators via IRAK4	We designed and synthesized a novel benzenediamine derivate, FC-99, that was tested for its ability to protect mice from experimental sepsis. Moreover, we sought to determine whether FC-99 could control a bacterial infection and to clarify the mechanism by which FC-99 inhibited LPS-activated macrophages. The effects of FC-99 on inflammation were evaluated in two experimental sepsismodels and in cultured macrophages. Microarrays and docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the target of FC-99. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular detectionwere performed to confirmthe direct interaction of FC-99 with its target. FC-99 protectedmice from experimental sepsis. The mice that received FC-99 exhibited a diminished inflammatory response, had a lower local bacterial burden, and experienced a significantly improved survival rate. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of FC-99-treated macrophages identified IRAK4 as a drug-regulated gene involved in LPS/TLR4 signaling. A computer search and calculations indicated that IRAK4 directly interacted with FC-99. Surface plasmon resonance, IRAK4-regulated signaling pathway analysis, and gene expression profiling of proinflammatory mediators confirmed the direct interaction between FC-99 and IRAK4. FC-99 is a potential therapeutic molecule for sepsis that alleviated experimental sepsis by directly inhibiting IRAK4 activation, which represents a novel target for sepsis therapy.

84906931886	Differential expression of microRNAs in decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells from patients with pre-eclampsia	Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at maternal-fetal interface are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE). microRNAs (miRNAs) also have an important influence on differentiation, maturation, and functions of MSCs. Our aim in this study was to determine the differential expression of miRNAs in decidua-derived MSCs (dMSCs) from severe PE and normal pregnancies. Results: miRNA expression profiles in dMSCs from five patients with severe PE and five healthy pregnant women were screened using microarray. Then, bioinformatic analysis of the microarray results was performed. Out of 179 differentially expressed miRNAs, 49 miRNAs had significant (p < 0.05) differential expression of ≥ 2.0-fold changes, including 21 up-regulated and 28 down-regulated. miRNA-Gene-network and miRNA-Gene ontology (GO) -network analyses were performed. Overall, 21 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated miRNAs showed high degrees in these analyses. Moreover, the significantly enriched signaling pathways and GOs were identified. The analyses revealed that pathways associated with cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune functions were highly regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs, including Wnt signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway, T-cell receptor signaling pathway, and B cell receptor signaling pathway. Four miRNA predicted target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, suppression of cytokine signaling 3, and serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A 55 kDa regulatory subunit B α isoform (PPP2R2A) were all decreased in dMSCs from patients with PE. Furthermore, the physiological roles of miR-16 and miR-136 in the down-regulation of VEGFA and PPP2R2A, respectively, were confirmed through reporter assays. Conclusions: These findings suggest that miRNAs in dMSCs may be important regulatory molecules in the development of PE.

84908870006	Extremely low frequency magnetic fields inhibit adipogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells	It was reported that obese (Ob/Ob) mice lose their weight and fat when treated with 0.5 T direct current electromagnetic fields. We also observed that 7.5 Hz, 0.4 T rotation of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) has an inhibitory effect on obesity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent cells capable of differentiating to different MSC lineages, including adipose. We hypothesized that inhibitory effects of ELF-MF on obesity may be related to the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 7.5 Hz, 0.4 T ELF-MF on differentiation of human umbilical cord MSCs. We found that ELF-MF inhibited adipogenic differentiation (exposed 2 h/day for 15 days) of MSCs but had no effect on osteogenic differentiation (exposed 2 h/day for 21 days). Moreover, ELF-MF inhibited adipocyte-specific expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 2 (PPARγ2). ELF-MF promoted c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK)-dependent intracellular signaling in MSCs. Furthermore, activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway provoked the inhibition of PPARγ2 expression resulting in suppression of adipogenic differentiation. In addition, the effects of ELF-MF on growth and apoptosis of MSCs were not observed. Our data indicated that ELF-MF of 7.5 Hz, 0.4 T inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs via JNK-dependent Wnt signaling pathway, but had no effect on the growth and function of MSCs, suggesting the inhibitory effect of ELF-MF on obesity may be attributed to the inhibition of differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes. This study may provide a potential approach for the treatment of obesity. Bioelectromagnetics 35:519-530, 2014.

84908407689	A novel small-molecule compound diaporine A inhibits non-small cell lung cancer growth by regulating miR-99a/mTOR signaling	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation is critically involved in lung cancer. Regulating miRNAs by natural agents may be a new strategy for cancer treatment. We previously found that a novel small-molecule compound diaporine A (D261), a natural product of endophytic fungus 3lp -10, had potential anti-cancer activites. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of D261 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) growth and its possible mechanisms involving miRNA regulation were investigated. By cell viability assay, cell proliferation analysis, and clonal growth assay, we proved that D261 effectively inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells (NCI-H460 and A549) in vitro. Administration of D261 (5 mg/kg) to NCI-H460 xenografts bearing mice also inhibited tumor growth and decreased the expression of cell proliferation regulator, midkine. Moreover, D261 induced cell cycle arrest with a reduced expression of various G

84918545199	MiR141-CXCL1-CXCR2 signaling-induced treg recruitment regulates metastases and survival of non-small cell lung cancer	Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) have a short median survival time and increased regulatory T cells (Treg). However, it is unclear whether some specific factors in MPE are involved in Treg recruitment in the progression of NSCLC. Here, we found that Treg population was increased in MPE and inversely correlated with patient survival (P < 0.001). Increased level of CXCL1 in MPE was associated with recruitment of Tregs ( P < 0.01). Moreover, miR141 regulated expression of CXCL1 in lung cancer cells, whereas the luciferase test confirmed that CXCL1 is a target of miR141. Chemotaxis assay showed that the miR141-CXCL1-CXCR2 pathway regulates migration of Tregs into MPE. Furthermore, miR141 significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in an immune-competent mouse model. This suppressive function was mediated by the CXCL1-CXCR2 pathway and recruitment of Tregs. Our study uncovered a causative link between microRNA and development of MPE. Mechanistically, decreased expressions of miR141, associated with the survival of patients with NSCLC with MPE, resulted in the increased production of CXCL1 and recruitment of Tregs to promote immune escape of tumor.

84919343557	A novel 1,2-benzenediamine derivative FC-99 suppresses TLR3 expression and ameliorates disease symptoms in a mouse model of sepsis	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Sepsis is a clinical condition characterized by overwhelming systemic inflammation with high mortality rate and high prevalence, but effective treatment is still lacking. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is an endogenous sensor, thought to regulate the amplification of immune response during sepsis. Modulators of TLR3 have an advantage in the treatment of sepsis. Here, we aimed to explore the mechanism of a monosubstituted 1,2-benzenediamine derivative FC-99 {N1-[(4-methoxy)methyl]-4- methyl-1,2-benzenediamine}on modulating TLR3 expression and its therapeutic potential on mouse model of sepsis.

10444235648	17β-estradiol regulates the numbers, endocytosis, stimulative capacity and IL-10 secretion of mouse spleen dendritic cells	The 17β-estradiol (17β-E2) is a steroid sex hormone that has a profound influence on the immune cells in inducing the apoptosis of both T and B lymphocytes. In this study, mouse spleen dendritic cells (SDCs) were treated with 17β-E2 and the numbers, endocytosis, stimulative capacity and cytokine production of SDCs were analysed. The results showed that 17β-E2 reduced the proliferation and stimulative capacity of SDCs and increased the endocytosis of SDCs in a dose-dependent pattern. 17β-E2 up-regulated IL-10 mRNA level in SDCs in a dose-dependent manner except for the 24 h time point. These data suggest that 17β-E2 may regulate the physiological and pathological immune response by reducing the number and stimulation of SDCs, increasing their endocytosis and IL-10 mRNA expression at the same time. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

11144269634	Pentachlorophenol reduces B lymphocyte function through proinflammatory cytokines in Carassius auratus	Cytokines and IgM levels are important parameters in the acquired immunity of fish. In the present study, the effect of pentachlorophenol (PCP) on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) and IL-1β (interleukin 1) mRNA levels of crucian carp, were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. To put the deduction of PCP's immunotoxicity on B cell function, B cells secretion of IgM under exposure of PCP-administrated fish macrophage was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the ability of B cells to secrete IgM was determined by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT). The results showed that the mRNA expressions of these two cytokines were suppressed by the administration of PCP. The supernatants from PCP-administrated fish macrophage showed less stimulation on B cell, lower maturation of B cells and secretion of IgM. These results suggested that PCP might have impact on micromilieu immune factors as proinflammatory cytokines. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

13444257501	Bifidobactenum longum as an oral delivery system of endostatin for gene therapy on solid liver cancer	To overcome difficulties that hampered widespread application of a specific delivery system in cancer gene therapy and to inhibit the growth of solid liver cancer, we utilized a strain of Bifidobactenum longum as a delivery system to transport an endostatin gene that can inhibit growth of tumor. The B. longum strain with the endostatin gene (B. longum-En) was taken orally by tumor-bearing nude mice through drencher preparation. The results showed that B. longum-En could strongly inhibit the growth of solid liver tumor in nude mice and prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing nude mice. Furthermore, tumor growth was inhibited more efficiently when the B. longum-En treatment included selenium. Enriching the B. longum-En treatment with selenium improves the activity of NK and T cells and stimulates the activity of IL-2 and TNF-α in BALB/c mice. These results suggest that B. longum may be a highly specific and efficient vector for transporting anticancer genes in cancer gene therapy.

84922394011	Serum CCL2 and CCL3 as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma	Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α/CCL3) are small chemotactic proteins that have been found in several kinds of tumor tissue samples and function as key regulators of cancer progression. However, the expression of CCL2 and CCL3 in serum samples of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic meaning of serum CCL2 and CCL3 in OSCC. The concentrationofCCL2 and CCL3 was assessed by ELISA in serum of OSCC patients (n=98), leukoplakia patients (n=14), and healthy donors (n=27). The results showed that the concentration of CCL2 in the OSCC group was significantly lower compared to that in the healthy controls (67.81 vs. 108.1 pg/ml, P<0.0001). The CCL3 concentration was higher in leukoplakia patients than in OSCC patients and healthy donors (201.9 vs. 153.9 or 118.3 pg/ml, P<0.05). No significant difference in CCL3 concentration was observed between OSCC patients and healthy donors. However, the OSCC group clearly presented two subclusters, i.e., CCL3<sup>LOW</sup>and CCL3<sup>HIGH</sup> OSCC subclusters, in which the serum level of CCL3 was positively related to the tumor size. Interestingly, the ratio of CCL2/CCL3 in OSCC patients was correlated to TNM (tumor, node, metastasis), smoking habits, and differentiation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve suggests that serum CCL2 is a good diagnostic marker to discriminate OSCC patients from healthy people (cutoff value, 101.1 pg/ml) and the ratio of CCL2/CCL3 also is a good diagnostic marker to discriminate leukoplakia patients and CCL3<sup>HIGH</sup> OSCC patients from healthy people (cutoff values, 1.080 and 0.424, respectively). These results indicate that CCL2 and CCL3 are associated with progression of OSCC and may be potential biomarkers.
