9344271110	Hypermethylation of the p16 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	We have recently reported that inactivation of the p16 gene by mutation and deletion is common in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study demonstrates that hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island can serve as an alternative mechanism for inactivation of the p16 gene in this tumor. Using Southern blotting analysis and multiplex PCR, aberrant methylation of the 5' CpG island of the p16 gene was found in a NPC xenograft (xeno-666) and 6 (22%) of 27 primary tumors, but not in normal tissues of the nasopharynx. In the NPC xenograft (xeno-666) and its newly derived cell line (cell-666), both showing hypermethylation of the p16 gene, no p16 gene expression was found. After treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, reexpression of the p16 gene was detected in the cell line cell-666. These findings suggest that aberrant methylation of the 5' CpG island may participate in the transcriptional inactivation of the p16 gene in NPC. The present results further support that the p16 gene is the critical target on chromosome 9p21 for inactivation during the development of this disease.

17844396455	Survival outcome of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with first local failure: A study by the Hong Kong nasopharyngeal carcinoma study group	Background. The purpose of this article is to report the overall survival (OS) outcome of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with local failure who received salvage treatment and to identify prognostic factors for OS. Methods. Between January 1996 and December 2000, 2915 patients received primary radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy for nonmetastatic NPC. At a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 319 patients had developed local failure as the first failure, with or without synchronous regional/distant failure. OS was calculated from the start of primary RT. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for OS in patients with isolated local failure. Results. The T classification distribution of the local failure (rT classification) was as follows: 68 (21%) rT1 to T2a, 92 (29%) rT2b, 82 (26%) rT3, and 77 (24%) rT4. The rT classification was the same as the initial T classification in 82% of patients. Two hundred seventy-five patients (86%) had isolated local failure, and 232 (84%) of them did not have any distant metastasis or regional failure develop during follow-up. Salvage treatment was given to 200 patients (73%) with isolated local failure. One hundred fifty-nine patients (80%) received reirradiation (108 external beam RT [EBRT], 44 brachytherapy, and seven EBRT plus brachytherapy), 22 patients (11%) underwent nasopharyngectomy with or without postoperative RT, and 19 patients (9%) were treated with chemotherapy alone. Four patients died of RT complications, and one died of chemotherapy toxicity in the absence of active NPC. The 3-year actuarial OS for patients with isolated local failure was 74%. On multivariate analysis, advanced initial T classification (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; p = .0006) and the use of salvage treatment (HR, 0.54; p = .0038) were independent prognostic factors. For the subgroups of patients who had the same recurrent and initial T classification, salvage treatment was associated with improved OS only in the subgroup with T1 to T2 local failure (n = 127; p = 0.0446), but not in the subgroups with T3 (n = 48) or T4 (n = 54) disease. Conclusions. Most patients with first local failure have localized disease. Salvage treatment is feasible in most of the patients with clinically isolated local failure. Patients who had early initial T classification have a more favorable prognosis. Subgroup analysis suggests that salvage treatment only prolongs survival in patients with T1 to T2 recurrent disease. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

20544448156	MR mimics of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly sensitive to radiotherapy, however, the local tumour recurrence rate still is around 30% in those patients who present with advanced T stage disease [Wolden SL, Zelefsky MJ, Hunt MA, Rosenzweig KE, Chong LM, Kraus DH, Pfister DG, et al. Failure of a 3D conformal boost to improve radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Int. J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2001;49:1229-34]. Local tumour recurrence is particularly difficult to treat. Further radiotherapy causes significant acute and late complications, while surgery is only suitable for early stage recurrence and the role of chemotherapy is mainly palliative. The identification of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma can be a challenge for both the clinician and the radiologist. The main diagnostic difficulty for MR imaging is the differentiation of recurrent tumour from post treatment scarring and fibrosis. However, we have encountered several other pathological processes that also may mimic local tumor recurrence. We present three such pathologies, radiation induced infection/inflammation, radiation induced granulation tissue, and radiation induced sarcoma (RIS). In all cases the patients underwent MR imaging for the evaluation of suspected tumor recurrence. Each case is presented, the pathology discussed, and the MR features that were useful in distinguishing these entities from malignancy are highlighted.

20044378115	Treatment results for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the modern era: The Hong Kong experience	Purpose: To analyze the treatment results achievable for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the modern era to identify the key failures for future improvement and to provide an updated baseline for future trials. Methods and Results: The results of 2687 consecutive patients treated at all public oncology centers in Hong Kong during 1996-2000 were retrospectively analyzed. The stage distribution (by American Joint Committee on Cancer and International Union Against Cancer staging system, 1997) was 7% Stage I, 41% Stage II, 25% Stage III, and 28% Stage IVA-B. All patients were irradiated with 6-MV photons and the median total dose was 66 Gy. Only 23% of patients had additional treatment with chemotherapy. Results: The 5-year local, nodal, and distant failure-free rates were 85%, 94%, and 81%, respectively; patients with local failure had significantly higher risk of nodal and distant failures. The 5-year progression-free, overall, and cancer-specific survival rates were 63%, 75%, and 80%, respectively. The presenting stage was the most important prognostic factor for all endpoints: with overall survival decreasing from 90% for Stage I to 58% for Stage IVA-B. The results achieved by the 2070 patients treated by radiotherapy alone were almost identical to that of the whole series, the distant failure-free rate among patients with locoregional control was 89% for Stage I-II and 75% for Stage III-IVB. The 860 patients (32%) staged with magnetic resonance imaging achieved significantly better results than those staged by computed tomography, the overall survival being 93% vs. 83% for Stages I-II, and 72% vs. 63% for Stages III-IVB (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Treatment results for nasopharyngeal carcinoma have substantially improved in the modern era; future trials should be based on updated baseline results. Further reduction of distant failure is important for future breakthrough, particularly for patients with advanced disease. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

21244488611	Multicenter prospective randomized trial comparing standard esophagectomy with chemoradiotherapy for treatment of squamous esophageal cancer: Early results from the Chinese university research group for esophageal cancer (CURE)	We conducted a prospective randomized trial to compare the ef.cacy and survival outcome by chemoradiation with that by esophagectomy as a curative treatment. From July 2000 to December 2004, 80 patients with potentially resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the mid or lower thoracic esophagus were randomized to esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy. A two- or three-stage esophagectomy with two-field dissection was performed. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy received continuous 5-.uorouracil infusion (200 mg/m2/day) from day 1 to 42 and cisplatin (60 mg/m2) on days 1 and 22. The tumor and regional lymphatics were concomitantly irradiated to a total of 50-60 Gy. Tumor response was assessed by endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and computed tomography scan. Salvage esophagectomy was performed for incomplete response or recurrence. Forty-four patients received standard esophagectomy, whereas 36 were treated with chemoradiotherapy. Median follow-up was 16.9 months. The operative mortality was 6.8%. The incidence of postoperative complications was 38.6%. No difference in the early cumulative survival was found between the two groups (RR = 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-2.17; log-rank test P = 0.45). There was no difference in the disease-free survival. Patients treated with surgery had a slightly higher proportion of recurrence in the mediastinum, whereas those treated with chemoradiation sustained a higher proportion of recurrence in the cervical or abdominal regions. Standard esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy offered similar early clinical outcome and survival for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The challenge lies in the detection of residue disease after chemoradiotherapy. © 2005 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

22644441141	The sonographic appearance and significance of cervical metastatic nodes following radiotherapy for nasopharyngaeal carcinoma	Serial ultrasound (US) was performed on 36 patients with palpable malignant nodes in the neck who had radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). All patients had a preradiotherapy baseline US examination, and follow-up studies at least 8 weeks after radiotherapy (RT). After RT there was diminution in size and disappearance of some of the nodes. However, in the residual nodes, US criteria for malignant nodes were still present in many of the post RT nodes, i.e. 140/143 (97.9%) residual nodes had an absent hilus and all the nodes were poorly reflective, 122 (85.3%) nodes still had sharp borders, 53 (37.1%) had a short to long axis (S/L) ratio greater than 0.5 and 11 (7.7%) nodes were greater than 8 mm in size. These parameters therefore are not of value in determining the persistence or recurrence of disease in a previously abnormal node. Appreciation of this fact should prevent unnecessary fine needle aspiration of these nodes up to 3 months following radiotherapy. © 1996 The Royal College of Radiologists.

0029882797	Early tumour response and treatment toxicity after hyperfractionated radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The aim of the present study was to undertake a planned interim analysis of a prospective randomized trial comparing the tumour response and the acute and subacute complications of hyperfractionated radiotherapy and conventional radiotherapy in non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). 100 patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic NPC were randomized to receive either conventional radiotherapy (Arm I) or hyperfractionated radiotherapy (Arm II). Stratification was done according to the T-Stage (modified Ho's T-Stage classification). The biological effective dose (10 Gy) to the primary and the upper cervical lymphatics were 75.0 and 73.1 for Arm I and 84.4 and 77.2 for Arm II, respectively. Hyperfractionated radiotherapy was associated with significant mucositis which is of higher grade than conventional radiotherapy (p = 0.0001), but the duration of mucositis was similar between the two Arms and all study patients completed radiotherapy on schedule without interruption of radiotherapy. Early survival and tumour recurrence rates were comparable between the Arms. The preliminary results indicate that the hyperfractionated radiotherapy has excellent patient compliance in Chinese patients, with acceptable acute and subacute toxicities and the local and regional complete tumour response rates being comparable with conventional radiotherapy. The significance of the time required after start of radiotherapy to achieve a complete tumour response is discussed.

0029889631	A retrospective study of the role of intracavitary brachytherapy and prognotic factors determining local tumour control after primary radical radiotherapy in 903 non-disseminated nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	The aims of this retrospective study were to determine the role of intracavitary brachytherapy given shortly after external beam radiotherapy in the primary radical treatment of non-metastatic nasopharyngeal (NPC) cancer patients, and the prognostic factors governing local tumour control. From 1984 to 1989, 903 patients with non-disseminated NPC who had had no previous treatment were managed at the Prince of Wales Hospital, where investigation and treatment methods had been standardized according to a departmental protocol. The external radiotherapy dose of 60.0-62.5 Gy in 6 weeks was given to all patients. Parapharyngeal booster radiotherapy with a single photon beam to 20 Gy in 2 weeks was given to those with parapharyngeal tumour extension. Computed tomography of the nasopharynx and skull base, and pretreatment nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy were performed in all patients. Nasopharyngoscopy was repeated at 4 weeks after the last day of external irradiation. Local persistence in 99 patients was treated additionally by intracavitary brachytherapy to 24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days. Fifty-one patients with early stage primary disease (Ho Stage T

0029948389	Loss of heterozygosity on the long arm of chromosome 11 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the long arm of chromosome 11 had been reported in many types of solid tumors. In this study, we investigated the LOH patterns of chromosome 11 on 52 primary nasopharyngeal carcinomas using 10 microsatellite polymorphic markers. The results revealed that 28 of the 52 cases (53.8%) demonstrated LOH on at least one of the nine 11q microsatellite loci studied. The highest frequencies of LOH were found at the two loci D11S2000 (36.1%) and D11S934 (34.5%), both located at 11q22-24. Two distinct regions of deletion were found at 11q, with the first one defined by INT-2 and D11S900 at 11q13.3-22, and the second region located between D11S2000 and D11S934 at 11q22-24. The two deletion regions overlap with the common areas of deletion reported in other tumor types. This suggests the presence of multiple putative tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 11q that may play a role in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinomas.

0029971122	Prognosticators determining survival subsequent to distant metastasis from nasopharyngeal carcinoma	BACKGROUND. Distant metastases are common in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and their presence is the most important factor in limiting survival. We aimed to study the prognosticators determining survival subsequent to distant metastasis from NPC. METHODS. A study by both mono and multivariate analyses was carried out in 945 patients presenting between 1084 and 1989. Forty-two presented with metastases and 247 developed metastasis after primary radiotherapy. RESULTS. Patients who presented with distant metastasis (M1-classification) had a significantly shorter survival than those who developed metastases after primary radiotherapy. The presence of hepatic metastases, short metastasis free interval, and older age at presentation significantly predicted short survival after the diagnosis of distant metastasis. Patients with metastases preceded by, and/or accompanied with, locoregional recurrence had comparable survival to those without, despite their association with a significantly longer metastasis free interval. A history of locoregional recurrence was however not compatible with long term, disease free survival, and, in its presence, advanced T- classification on presentation predicted poor survival subsequent to metastasis. Long term disease free survival (64- 117 months) was attained in 4 young patients (age < 40 years) with isolated intrathoracic metastases in the absence of locoregional recurrence after achieving a complete response to aggressive treatment, with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery, usually multimodal. CONCLUSIONS. Some of the clinical prognosticators have been identified and an attempt was made to subclassify distant metastases according to possible differences in prognosis. A subset of metastatic NPC was identified which is compatible with long term, disease free survival. Investigations during follow-up should be directed toward tile early detection of such potentially salvageable cases.

0029993152	Radiotherapy for extreme hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy associated with malignancy	A patient with florid hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) associated with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma is presented. Despite the presence of metastatic disease in the thorax and in bone, the patient's main symptom was severe pain from the HPOA, which was temporarily relieved by chemotherapy. Her disease subsequently progressed during chemotherapy and the pain became resistant to conventional treatment, including high dose morphine, non-steriodal anti-inflammatory agents and steriods. It was only with local radiation to the involved joints that the pain could be controlled. Our patient demonstrates that local radiotherapy is an option for the palliation of extreme HPOA.

0030024150	Prevalence and prognostic significance of tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	BACKGROUND. Tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia (TATE) has been associated with an improved prognosis in a variety of neoplasms. METHODS. Diagnostic biopsy specimens from 96 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were reviewed for the presence of TATE by an observer blinded to the patients' clinical histories. Comparisons between patients with and without TATE with respect to the probabilities of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival were performed using the log rank test on Kaplan Meier product-limit estimates and the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS. The prevalence of TATE in these patients was 32%, and was not significantly associated with local recurrence, distant metastasis, or survival. CONCLUSIONS. These results are discordant with those of studies in other tumor models, although comparison is hampered by varying definitions of TATE. The differing results may be due to variations in the degree of activation of the eosinophils present in TATE in different tumors.

0030200882	Strong association between hyperferritinaemia and metastatic disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	We have investigated the role of serum ferritin, in relation to disease stages, in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Patients with localised disease (Ho's stage I-IV) had levels which were not significantly different from age, sex matched normal subjects and there was no relationship between mean serum ferritin levels and stage. However, in patients with metastatic disease levels were grossly elevated with mean levels increased more than 6-fold compared to normal subjects and patients with localised disease. Furthermore, among the small group of patients with localised disease but hyperferritinaemia, the subsequent development of metastatic disease within 1 year was significantly much higher (32.4%) than in those with levels falling within the reference range (10.3%). Hyperferritinaemia is strongly associated with, and may predict, metastatic disease in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

0030250889	Significant prognosticators after primary radiotherapy in 903 nondisseminated nasopharyngeal carcinoma evaluated by computer tomography	Purpose: To evaluate the significant prognosticators in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and Materials: From 1984 to 1989, 903 treatment- naive nondisseminated (M0) NPC were given primary radical radiotherapy to 60- 62.5 Gy in 6 weeks. All patients had computed tomographic (CT) and endoscopic evaluation of the primary tumor. Potentially significant parameters (the patient's age and sex, the anatomical structures infiltrated by the primary lesion, the cervical nodal characteristics, the tumor histological subtypes, and various treatment variables were analyzed by both monovariate and multivariate methods for each of the five clinical endpoints: actuarial survival, disease-free survival, free from distant metastasis, free from local failure, and free from regional failure. Results: The significant prognosticators predicting for an increased risk of distant metastases and poorer survival included male sex, skull base and cranial nerve(s) involvement, advanced Ho's N level, and presence of fixed or partially fixed nodes or nodes contralateral to the side of the bulk of the nasopharyngeal primary. Advanced patient age led to significantly worse survival and poorer local tumor control. Local and regional failures were both increased by tumor infiltrating the skull base and/or the cranial nerves. In addition, regional failure was increased significantly by advancing Ho's N level. Parapharyngeal tumor involvement was the strongest independent prognosticator that determined distant metastasis and survival rates in the abscence of the overriding prognosticators of skull base infiltration, cranial nerve(s) palsy, and cervical nodal metastasis. Conclusions: The significant prognosticators are delineated after the advent of CT and these should form the foundation of the modern stage classification for NPC.

The radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) features are highlighted. Although the occurrence of metastatic disease in hepatocellular carcinoma is exceedingly rare, it may be increasingly encountered as survival of patients is improved with advancing methods of therapy, both surgical and palliative. It often accompanies local recurrence, and invariably signals a grave prognosis with extremely short life expectancy. Unusually, two of the five patients in this series presented initially with skeletal metastases which led to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

0030974940	Retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: This study was done to investigate the size of normal retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RLN) and the incidence of retropharyngeal lymph node involvement in patients with nasopharyngyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Forty-four NPC patients who had not yet received treatment and 20 control subjects underwent MRI scanning. The number and the maximum diameter of the short axis of the cervical lymph nodes were measured. The number of nasopharyngeal walls involved and the maximum diameter of the tumor were recorded. Results: In 5 of 20 control subjects lateral RLN were identified; none of these nodes was greater than 2.5 mm. In the NPC patients, taking 4 mm as the upper limit of normal RLN, 89% of the patients had enlarged RLN. The number of nasopharyngeal walls involved and the maximum diameter of the primary tumor showed no statistical relationship with the involvement of RLN. There was a statistical association between RLN and level II node involvement, but not with other groups of neck nodes. Conclusion: Of all patients with NPC, 89% showed enlarged RLN. Its involvement was related to level II nodes but not to the number of nasopharyngeal sites involved nor with the maximum diameter of the tumor.

0031776840	Specific latent membrane protein 1 gene sequences in type 1 and type 2 Epstein-Barr virus from nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong	We reported previously that a characteristic Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein I (EBV-LMP1) gene was associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Hong Kong. It showed a 30 bp deletion at the carboxyl terminus with specific amino acid substitution Asp at codon 335 with reference to Gly in B95-8 LMP1. This deletion variant Asp335 was present in over 90% of NPC biopsy specimens. The present study attempted to determine the whole encoding sequence of the LMP1 gene in different EBV isolates from NPC, and its relation with EBV types. We found that 92% (34/37) of primary NPC tumours harboured EBV-I and possessed the LMP1 deletion variant, of which 86% were Asp335 and 6% were Gly335. EBV-2 was present in 8% (3/37) of tumours and all contained the retention variant of the LMP1 gene. Sequencing of the whole encoding region of the LMP1 gene revealed that the deletion variant Asp335 and deletion variant Gly335 carried similar sequences. They showed 43 common nucleotide substitutions in 41 codons with reference to B95-8. The retention variant showed 52 base changes in 46 codons compared with B95-8. The amino acid alterations in both the deletion and retention variants were mostly clustered at the transmembrane domain of the protein. Furthermore, half of the substitutions were common to both variants, suggesting a common evolutionary selection pressure. Nonetheless, the 2 LMP1 variants showed differences in nucleotide alterations and were associated with different EBV types, suggesting the presence of 2 distinct EBV strains in Hong Kong NPC.

Auditory brainstem responses and pure tone audiometry were performed before radiotherapy, and at 3 and 12 months after completion of radiotherapy. There were no significant changes in the wave I-III and III-V interpeak intervals, or in sensorineural hearing thresholds (bone conduction at 4 kHz and average of bone conduction at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz), after radiotherapy. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evoked potential evidence of subclinical brainstem damage arising from irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

0031827761	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Dynamic MR imaging with gadolinium	Objective: To evaluate the use of enhanced dynamic MR images in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Dynamic enhanced turbo spin-echo transverse images were obtained in 35 patients with newly diagnosed NPC. Comparison was made between the pre-contrast image, last enhanced scan and dynamic series in assessment of the extent of primary tumor and lymph node involvement. Results: Enhanced MR images improved delineation of tumor in the following regions, nasopharyngeal wall (6/35), levator palatini (44/70), tensor palatini (12/70), prevertebral muscles (3/70), medial pterygoid muscle (7/70), pharyngobasilar fascia (30/35), parapharyngeal fat space (23/70), nasal cavity (33/70), oropharynx (6/35), sphenoid sinus (6/35), maxillary sinus (6/70), ethmoid air cells (14/35), cavernous sinus (5/35), cranial fossa (4/35), clivus (13/35) and pterygoid genu (2/70). Eight of the 9 normal and 79/82 abnormal nodal groups, on conventional imaging criteria, enhanced with the same pattern and intensity as the primary tumor. The dynamic series did not improve delineation of tumor extent in comparison with that obtained on last enhanced image. Conclusion: Enhanced MR images are valuable in evaluating the extent of primary tumor. Dynamic imaging was of no additional benefit in the evaluation tumor extent.

2542519941	Staging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Suggestions for improving the current UICC/AJCC Staging System	Aims: To evaluate the current UICC/AJCC Staging System for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and to search for ways of improving the system. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 2687 consecutive patients treated in five public centres in Hong Kong during the period 1996-2000. All patients were staged by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both. The prognostic significance of the current stage assignment on various aspects of tumour control was evaluated. Results: T-category, N-category and stage-group were all significant prognostic factors for major end points (P<0.01). However, the distinction of prognosis between Stage I and II was insignificant (5-year cancer-specific survival being 92% vs 95%; P=0.13). Multivariate analyses (corrected for age and sex) revealed lack of significance between T2a and T1 in hazards of local and distant failures, N3a and N2 in distant failure and subgroups of T1-2N0 in cancer-specific deaths. Corresponding down-staging of T2a to T1, N3a to N2, and subgroup T2N0 to stage I, resulted in more even and orderly increase in the hazard ratio of cancer-specific deaths (from 1 for stage I to 1.98 for II, 3.5 for III, 6.08 for IVA and 8.62 for IVB), better hazard consistency among subgroups of the same stage and more balanced stage distribution. Conclusions: The current UICC/AJCC staging System could be further improved by the modifications suggested; validation of the current proposal by external data is urgently awaited. © 2004 The Royal College of Radiologists.

29244448683	Chemotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: An individual patient data meta-analysis of eight randomized trials and 1753 patients	Objectives: To study the effect of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy (RT) on overall survival and event-free survival for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods and Materials: This meta-analysis used updated individual patient data from randomized trials comparing chemotherapy plus RT with RT alone in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The log-rank test, stratified by trial, was used for comparisons, and the hazard ratios of death and failure were calculated. Results: Eight trials with 1753 patients were included. One trial with a 2 × 2 design was counted twice in the analysis. The analysis included 11 comparisons using the data from 1975 patients. The median follow-up was 6 years. The pooled hazard ratio of death was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.94; p = 0.006), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 6% at 5 years from the addition of chemotherapy (from 56% to 62%). The pooled hazard ratio of tumor failure or death was 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.86; p < 0.0001), corresponding to an absolute event-free survival benefit of 10% at 5 years from the addition of chemotherapy (from 42% to 52%). A significant interaction was observed between the timing of chemotherapy and overall survival (p = 0.005), explaining the heterogeneity observed in the treatment effect (p = 0.03), with the highest benefit resulting from concomitant chemotherapy. Conclusion: Chemotherapy led to a small, but significant, benefit for overall survival and event-free survival. This benefit was essentially observed when chemotherapy was administered concomitantly with RT. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

29244464673	Association of post-irradiation temporal lobe necrosis and extra-cranial carotid stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Aim: To ascertain whether temporal lobe necrosis and extracranial carotid stenosis as long-term complications of radiation are associated. Patients and Methods: Ninety two patients underwent colour doppler ultrasound examinations for the assessment of carotid artery and cross sectional imaging of the brain. The presence of extracranial carotid stenosis was correlated with the presence of temporal lobe necrosis. Results: Sixty three patients had carotid artery stenosis (87 common carotid arteries and 65 internal carotid arteries). Twenty patients had temporal lobe necrosis diagnosed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The 2 complications were associated (p = 0.072). When extracranial carotid stenosis is used to predict the presence of temporal lobe necrosis, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 27.0%, 89.7%, 55.0%. 36.1%, and 46.7%, respectively. Conclusion: The presence of extracranial carotid stenosis is not a reliable test to predict the presence of temporal lobe necrosis, but the absence of this complication makes the presence of temporal lobe necrosis unlikely.

3042737594	Lung metastasis alone in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A relatively favorable prognostic group: A study by the Hong Kong Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Study Group	BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to examine the pattern and the predictive factors of distant metastases (DM) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after primary radiotherapy treatment. METHODS. Data from all five regional cancer centers in Hong Kong were collected retrospectively and pooled for the current study, which was coordinated by the Hong Kong Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Study Group. The sample was comprised of all 2915 patients with NPC without DM at the time of presentation who were treated with radiotherapy in 1 of the 5 cancer centers during the period between January 1996 and December 2000. RESULTS. DM was found to be the leading cause of NPC failure, with a 5-year actuarial rate of 14.9% in this patient cohort. Despite the poor overall survival (OS) of these patients, those with lung metastasis alone represented a distinctive group associated with a significantly better OS. International Union Against Cancer (UICC) N classification, UICC T classification, advanced age, and male gender were found to be significant and independent determinants for DM. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term survival is possible in patients with distant metastatic NPC confined to the lung. An aggressive approach to treatment for this group of patients should be considered. © 2004 American Cancer Society.

33646427170	Reduced plasma RNA integrity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	Purpose: Recent research has shown the feasibility of detecting cell-free RNA markers in human subjects. As elevated RNase activity has previously been described in the circulation of cancer patients, we hypothesized that cancer patients may have reduced plasma RNA integrity. In this study, we used nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) as a model system to test this hypothesis. Experimental Design: Plasma RNA integrity was determined using the ratio of the concentrations of transcript sequences corresponding to the 3′ to those from the 5′ end of a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Transcript concentrations were measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays targeting the 5′ and 3′ regions. We analyzed the plasma RNA integrity in 49 untreated NPC patients and 53 healthy controls. We also assessed the plasma samples from 19 NPC patients before and after radiotherapy to further show the clinical potential of this marker. Results: The 3′ to 5′ GAPDH ratio was significantly lower in the plasma of untreated NPC patients when compared with healthy controls (0.0252 versus 0.0485, P = 0.024). Statistical analysis showed that plasma GAPDH ratio was correlated with tumor stage but not with sex and age. Moreover, 14 of 19 NPC patients (74%) showed significant increase in the plasma GAPDH ratio following radiotherapy (P = 0.003). All of these patients were in clinical remission after treatment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that NPC is associated with disturbances in the integrity of cell-free circulating RNA, raising the possibility that measurement of plasma RNA integrity may serve as a useful marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of malignant diseases. © 2006 African Association for Cancer Research.

33646554968	Aetiological factors and imaging program for severe radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Over a period of 3 years, we have collected the carotid ultrasound findings of 189 post-radiotherapy (RT) nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. The patients had duplex ultrasound examination for assessment of extracranial carotid stenosis. Factors including age, sex, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking history, time lapsed after RT, symptoms of cerebrovascular disease were recorded. Association of individual factor with development of severe stenosis was assessed. Eighty-two (43%) patients developed moderate to severe stenosis of the common carotid and/or internal carotid artery. Age and time lapsed after RT were the only factors found to be associated with development of severe stenosis. When age >57 years and >12 years post-RT were used as rules to identify patients with severe stenosis, the sensitivity was 46.7%, specificity 98.2%, PPV 77.8% and NPV 95.6%. Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is a common event. If available resources do not allow routine surveillance, age and time lapsed after RT help to identify high-risk patients. © 2003 International Cancer Imaging Society.

33747874526	Dose-response relationship of nasopharyngeal carcinoma above conventional tumoricidal level: A study by the Hong Kong nasopharyngeal carcinoma study group (HKNPCSG)	Background and purpose: To define the dose-response relationship of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) above the conventional tumoricidal dose level of 66 Gy when the basic radiotherapy (RT) course was given by the 2D Ho's technique. Patients and methods: Data from all five regional cancer centers in Hong Kong were pooled for this retrospective study. All patients (n=2426) were treated with curative-intent RT with or without chemotherapy between 1996 and 2000 with the basic RT course using the Ho's technique. The primary endpoint was local control. The prognostic significance of dose-escalation ('boost') after 66 Gy, T-stage, N-stage, use of chemotherapy, sex and age (≤40 years vs >40 years) was studied. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: On multivariate analysis, T-stage (P< 0.01; hazard ratio [HR], 1.58) and optimal boost (P=0.01; HR, 0.34) were the only significant factors affecting local failure for the whole study population, and for the population of patients treated by radiotherapy alone, but not for patients who also received chemotherapy. The following were independent determinants of local failure for patient groups with different T-stages treated by radiotherapy alone: use of a boost in T1/T2a disease (P=0.01; HR, 0.33); use of a boost (P<0.01; HR, 0.60) and age (P=0.01; HR, 1.02) in T3/T4 tumors. Among patients with T2b tumors treated by radiotherapy alone and given a boost, the use of a 20 Gy-boost gave a lower local failure rate than a 10 Gy-boost. There was no apparent excess mortality attributed to RT complications. Conclusions: Within the context of a multi-center retrospective study, dose-escalation above 66 Gy significantly improved local control for T1/T2a and T3/4 tumors when the primary RT course was based on the 2D Ho's technique without additional chemotherapy. 'Boosting' in NPC warrants further investigation. Caution should be taken when boosting is considered because of possible increase in radiation toxicity. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33845562267	Clinical studies of immunomodulatory activities of Yunzhi-Danshen in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Objectives: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent tumor in Hong Kong, The immune system of such patients could be adversely affected during the course of conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Yunzhi-Danshen capsules in NPC patients treated with radiotherapy. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week study. Setting/location: The Prince of Wales Hospital, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Subjects: Twenty-seven (27) patients with histologically proven NPC, at least 18 years of age. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with histologically proven NPC were recruited to take Yunzhi (3.6 g daily) and Dangshem (1.4 g daily) in the form of 12 combination capsules (TCM group) or placebo (12 capsules) daily for 16 weeks, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to assess the percentages and absolute counts of human lymphocyte subsets in whole blood. Plasma concentration of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Ex vivo production of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 in the whole blood assay culture supernatant was measured by ELISA. Results: The decreases in percentage and absolute count of T lymphocytes in the TCM group were less than those in the placebo group after they took the capsules for 16 weeks (both p < 0.05). Furthermore, the decreases in absolute count of T suppressor cells plus cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and T helper cells in the TCM group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group after they took the capsules for 16 weeks (both p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results suggest that Yunzhi-Danshen can exert an immunomodulating effect in alleviating lymphopenia during radiotherapy in NPC patients. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

33750957265	Radiological, pathological and DNA remission in recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: Circulating plasma Epstein Barr Virus DNA (EBV-DNA) is a sensitive and specific marker of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The mainstay of treatment of metastatic NPC is systemic chemotherapy and resection for solitary metastasis. Despite high response rate to chemotherapy, complete remission is uncommonly seen. Case Presentation: We report a case of recurrent metastatic NPC in a 43-year-old man, who achieved complete remission three times with chemotherapy and surgery. Serial plasma EBV-DNA levels were measured during the course of disease. The patient had three episodes of recurrences of NPC manifested as distant metastasis. Both time, rise in the plasma EBV-DNA level preceded detection of recurrences by imaging. Following systemic chemotherapy, he achieved complete remission each time, of which was confirmed by 18-flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and hepatectomy pathology. The plasma EBV-DNA level dropped to zero copy/ml at the time of each remission. Conclusion: This case highlights the high chemosensitivity of NPC by illustrating a rare occurrence of complete response of metastatic NPC to chemotherapy. This case also underscores the usefulness of EBV-DNA as a useful tool in monitoring NPC by its ability to detect early recurrence and excellent correlation with treatment response. © 2006 Chan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33846046008	Early swallowing problems in a cohort of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Symptomatology and videofluoroscopic findings	OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence and the degree of swallowing dysfunction in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who underwent radiation therapy treatment. INSTITUTION: The study was conducted in the Prince of Wales Hospital, a tertiary teaching hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 1999 to July 2001, a cohort of 20 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed NPC was prospectively studied. Questions about symptoms, including swallowing functions, were asked, and head and neck examination including oromotor examination was performed in the subjects before radiation therapy. All patients were subjected to videofluoroscopy (VFSS) to assess their swallowing function. Abnormalities were scored if they were present on two of three swallow attempts. The patients were reassessed at 6 months and 12 months after radiotherapy by symptom assessment and VFSS. RESULTS: There were 14 male and 6 female patients. The mean age was 43.9 years. Nine patients had early (stage I and II) disease, whereas 11 patients had advanced (stage III and IV) disease. Nine patients were treated by radiation therapy only and 11 patients by concurrent chemoirradiation. Ninety-five percent of the subjects had subjective dysphagia at 6 and 12 months after radiation therapy. Ninety percent had xerostomia, and 80% had to avoid certain foods at 12 months postradiation therapy. All subjects had to alternate solid food with fluid intake to facilitate swallowing. An average reduction of jaw movement by 1 cm was noted. A large proportion of patients had stasis of food in the pharynx (100% in valleculae and 60% in pyriform fossae) and impaired pharyngeal peristalsis (60%). One quarter of patients had laryngeal penetration. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective swallowing difficulties were common in patients in the early follow-up period after radiation therapy for NPC according to questionnaire assessment. An objective swallowing study revealed that swallowing dysfunction was persistent 12 months after radiation therapy. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

33846549496	Reliability of measurement of skin ultrasonic properties in vivo: A potential technique for assessing irradiated skin	Background/aims: Quantitative and objective technique to assess radiation-induced tissue fibrosis is important for clinicians to estimate the efficiency of radiotherapeutic schemes. It has been widely reported that ultrasonic properties are sensitive to changes of acoustic scatterers in biological tissues. Therefore, measurement of ultrasonic properties may serve as a potential assessment technique for irradiated skins. The aim of the present study is to investigate the reliability of such measurement so as to evaluate its potentials for future clinical applications. Methods: Ultrasonic parameters including attenuation slope (β), integrated attenuation (IA) and integrated backscatter (IBS) were measured for the frequency range of 10-25MHz from echographic signals of the forearm and neck dermis of 20 normal subjects in vivo. The intra- and inter-rater reliability of measurement was assessed in 10 normal subjects using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman test. Results: The intra- and inter-rater measurement was demonstrated to be reliable as indicated by high ICC values generally larger than 0.80. In addition, the ultrasonic parameters could successfully differentiate the skins in the neck and forearm regions. Conclusion: The measurement provided reliable information on the ultrasonic properties of the skins and could be potentially applied to comparative clinical trials to assess the late effects of radiotherapy on skins. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.

33947194211	Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma-a prognostic evaluation and correlation with hypoxia inducible factor 1α and vascular endothelial growth factor	Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2), hypoxia inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be induced by the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) cell lines. This study examined the prognostic relevance of COX-2 and its relationship with HIF-1α and VEGF expression in NPC biopsies. Primary tumor biopsies were obtained from 78 participants of a randomized trial who received radiotherapy (RT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced NPC. These were analyzed for COX-2 expression and then correlated with age, sex, disease stage, treatment arm, survival and disease recurrence, VEGF and HIF-1α expression in a regression model. 83% of tumors expressed COX-2, 47% co-expressed COX-2 and VEGF, 38% co-expressed COX-2 and HIF-1α. On univariate analysis, COX-2 expression did not correlate with survival and recurrence, but moderate to high COX-2 expression was associated with advanced nodal stage (p = 0.03). Although univariate analysis showed that COX-2-HIF-1α co-expression was associated with worse progression-free survival (p = 0.046), time to local (p = 0.004) and regional recurrence (p = 0.007), multivariate analysis failed to confirm any correlation between COX-2-HIF-1α or COX-2-VEGF co-expression and survival or disease recurrence. Contrary to previous report, this study failed to demonstrate any prognostic significance of COX-2 expression alone or co-expression with HIF-1α or VEGF in advanced NPC. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33846882653	Delayed complications of radiotherapy treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: imaging findings	Radiotherapy is used to treat a wide variety of head and neck tumours that arise in and around the skull base. The delayed effects of radiation damages a range of structures, including the nervous system, bone, major vessels, mucus membranes, pituitary and salivary glands, as well as increasing the risk of radiation-induced neoplasms. In this review the complications resulting from radiation treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a cancer treated with a high dose of radiation to a fairly large region, are illustrated. Many patients with NPC have a long-term survival, so are at risk of developing delayed radiation effects, and hence may demonstrate a wide range of complications on imaging. Other tumours around the skull base treated with radiotherapy include meningiomas, chordomas, chondrosarcomas, pituitary adenomas, paranasal sinus and nasal cavity tumours. In these cases similar complications may be encountered on imaging, although the severity, incidence and location will vary. © 2006 The Royal College of Radiologists.

33847742531	Plasma Epstein-Barr viral deoxyribonucleic acid quantitation complements tumor-node-metastasis staging prognostication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: To evaluate the effect of combining circulating Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA load data with TNM staging data in pretherapy prognostication of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and Methods: Three hundred seventy-six patients with all stages of NPC were studied. Pretreatment plasma/ serum EBV DNA concentrations were quantified by a polymerase chain reaction assay. Determinants of overall survival were assessed by multivariate analysis. Survival probabilities of patient groups, segregated by clinical stage (I, II, III, or IV) alone and also according to EBV DNA load (low or high), were compared. Results: Pretherapy circulating EBV DNA load is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in NPC. Patients with early-stage disease were segregated by EBV DNA levels into a poor-risk subgroup with survival similar to that of stage III disease and a good-risk subgroup with survival similar to stage I disease. Conclusion: Pretherapy circulating EBV DNA load is an independent prognostic factor to International Union Against Cancer (UICC) staging in NPC. Combined interpretation of EBV DNA data with UICC staging data leads to alteration of risk definition of patient subsets, with improved risk discrimination in early-stage disease. Validation studies are awaited. © 2006 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

34250203600	New measure of health-related quality of life for patients with oropharyngeal mucositis: Development and preliminary psychometric evaluation	BACKGROUND. Oropharyngeal mucositis (OM) causes profound impairment of patients' health-related quality of life (HQoL). The aim of the article is to describe the development and preliminary validation of an HQoL instrument, OMQoL, specifically for patients with OM. METHODS. First, a qualitative phase was conducted to generate items (n = 23). Face validity was assessed by focus group interviews (n = 13). Expert content review (n = 7) was used to ensure content validity. The second step was a quantitative validation phase comprised a multicenter study (n = 210) to help identify subscales of the instrument addressing different dimensions of OM and to measure reliability. RESULTS. The qualitative interview generated 171 items. Using focus group discussion and expert content review, items were reduced to 41 items. Factor and scaling analyses of these 41 items resulted in 4 subscales, contributed by 31 items, depicting problems with symptoms, diet, social function, and swallowing. The floor effect was modest. The factorial structure was satisfactory with loading >0.40 on each subscale for all items. All corrected item-total corrections were higher than 0.40 (r = 0.457-0.874). The internal consistency reliability of each subscale was high, with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from 0.906 to 0.934. The test-retest reliability of the individual items using weighted kappa was good (kappa values 0.610-0.895). The intraclass correlation results for the subscale totals were all in excess of 0.70 (0.864-0.934). CONCLUSIONS. An initial psychometric analysis of the OMQoL was encouraging. The OMQoL could provide a valuable tool for the assessment of HQoL of patients with OM. © 2007 American Cancer Society.

34547100972	High Frequency Ultrasound Assessment of Skin Fibrosis: Clinical Results	Fibrosis is a common late effect of radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients. Current clinical assessment of radiation-induced fibrosis is generally limited to clinician-based rating scales, which are usually not sufficient for quantitative and objective evaluations. Ultrasonic propagation properties of tissues are widely reported to be sensitive to the alterations of tissue compositions and structures. Based on our previous feasibility study, we used four parameters including skin thickness and three ultrasonic parameters of dermal tissues (attenuation slope [β], integrated attenuation [IA] and integrated backscatter [IBS]) in the frequency range of 10 to 25 MHz for the assessment of skin fibrosis. Experiments were conducted on the forearm and neck skin in patients with postirradiation fibrosis in the neck region. The palpation score and stiffness of the neck soft tissue were also measured as an indication of fibrotic severity. Comparisons of the results between 38 patients and 20 control subjects showed a significantly smaller β (p = 0.005) and a significantly larger skin thickness (p < 0.004) and IA (p = 0.04) in the neck skins of the patients. However, age-matched comparisons showed there were neither significant differences among patient subgroups with different fibrotic levels assessed using manual palpation or significant correlations between the four parameters and the overall stiffness of the neck soft tissues (p > 0.05). In conclusion, ultrasound tissue characterization may provide additional information for the assessment of postirradiation skin fibrosis in the neck region. Further studies are necessary to investigate the feasibility of applying the current measurement for differentiating the severity of skin fibrosis.

34547889915	Nasopharyngeal Cancers: Which Method Should be Used to Measure these Irregularly Shaped Tumors on Cross-Sectional Imaging?	Purpose: To determine whether the standard techniques of measuring tumor size and change in size after treatment could be applied to the measurement of nasopharyngeal cancers, which are often irregular in shape. Methods and Materials: The standard measurements of bidimensional (BDM) (World Health Organization criteria) and unidimensional (UDM) (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria), together with the maximum depth of the tumor perpendicular to the pharyngeal wall (DM), were acquired from axial magnetic resonance images of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma in 44 patients at diagnosis and in 29 of these patients after treatment. Tumor volume measurements (VM), acquired from the summation of areas from the axial magnetic resonance images, were used as the reference standard. Results: There was a significant association between VM and BDM with respect to tumor size at diagnosis (p = 0.002), absolute change in tumor size after treatment (p < 0.001), and percentage change in tumor size after treatment (p = 0.044), but not between VM and UDM. There was also a significant association between VM and DM with respect to percentage change in tumor size after treatment (p = <0.0001) but not absolute change (p = 0.222). Conclusion: When using simple measurements to assess irregularly shaped nasopharyngeal cancers, the BDM should be used to measure size at diagnosis and the BDM and percentage change in size with treatment. Unidimensional measurement does not reflect size or change in size, and therefore the RECIST criteria may not be applicable to all tumor shapes. The use of DM requires further evaluation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34548456832	Feasibility of using interpolated contours of targets and organs at risk in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for advanced-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma	To assess the dosimetric effect of using interpolated contours in planning intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for advanced T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The present study focused on T3-T4 tumours where the proximity of targets to neurological organs poses a stringent test on the feasibility of such an approach. Contours of targets and organs were delineated on CT images of 2.5-mm interval and a reference IMRT plan was generated. An investigative (INV) IMRT plan was then generated with the same planning protocol, but based on interpolated contours that replaced deleted contours on alternate slices. The reference and INV plans were compared. Regarding target coverage, all targets in the INV plans met the acceptance criteria except for the PTV in one case. Regarding organs, the mean dose to 1% volume of the brainstem and spinal cord in the INV plans were kept below their dose limits. No significant differences in the mean doses to others organs were found. Satisfactory target coverage and protection of critical organs to a degree similar to full-scale contouring could be achieved with use of interpolated contours. The saving in manpower time for contouring is expected to significantly improve the throughput of the IMRT planning process. © 2007 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.

35548996363	Dosimetric Comparison Between 2-Dimensional Radiation Therapy and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Treatment of Advanced T-Stage Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: To Treat Less or More in the Planning Organ-At-Risk Volume of the Brainstem and Spinal Cord	The aim of this study is to evaluate the deficiencies in target coverage and organ protection of 2-dimensional radiation therapy (2DRT) in the treatment of advanced T-stage (T3-4) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and assess the extent of improvement that could be achieved with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), with special reference to of the dose to the planning organ-at-risk volume (PRV) of the brainstem and spinal cord. A dosimetric study was performed on 10 patients with advanced T-stage (T3-4 and N0-2) NPC. Computer tomography (CT) images of 2.5-mm slice thickness of the head and neck were acquired with the patient immobilized in semi-extended-head position. A 2D plan based on Ho's technique, and an IMRT plan based on a 7-coplanar portals arrangement, were established for each patient. 2DRT was planned with the field borders and shielding drawn on the simulator radiograph with reference to bony landmarks, digitized, and entered into a planning computer for reconstruction of the 3D dose distribution. The 2DRT and IMRT treatment plans were evaluated and compared with respect to the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the targets and the organs-at-risk (OARs), tumor control probability (TCP), and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs). With IMRT, the dose coverage of the target was superior to that of 2DRT. The mean minimum dose of the GTV and PTV were increased from 33.7 Gy (2DRT) to 62.6 Gy (IMRT), and 11.9 Gy (2DRT) to 47.8 Gy (IMRT), respectively. The D

36849010786	Prospective randomized study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy on salivary gland function in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	Purpose: This randomized trial compared the rates of delayed xerostomia between two-dimensional radiation therapy (2DRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and Methods: Between November 2001 and December 2003, 60 patients with T1-2bN0-1M0 NPC were randomly assigned to receive either IMRT or 2DRT. Primary end point was incidence of observer-rated severe xerostomia at 1 year after treatment based on Radiotherapy Oncology Group /European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Parallel assessment with patient-reported outcome, stimulated parotid flow rate (SPFR), and stimulated whole saliva flow rate (SWSFR) were also made. Results: At 1 year after treatment, patients in IMRT arm had lower incidence of observer-rated severe xerostomia than patients in the 2DRT arm (39.3% v 82.1%; P = .001), parallel with a higher fractional SPFR (0.90 v 0.05; P < .0001), and higher fractional SWSFR (0.41 v 0.20; P = .001). As for patient's subjective feeling, although a trend of improvement in patient-reported outcome was observed after IMRT, recovery was incomplete and there was no significant difference in patient-reported outcome between the two arms. Conclusion: IMRT is superior to 2DRT in preserving parotid function and results in less severe delayed xerostomia in the treatment of early-stage NPC. Incomplete improvement in patient's subjective xerostomia with parotid-sparing IMRT reflects the need to enhance protection of other salivary glands. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

0033083216	Increased incidence of tongue cancer after primary radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma - The possibility of radiation carcinogenesis	The aim of this study was to define the risk of tongue and other aerodigestive tract cancers developing after primary radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A cohort of 903 patients with non- disseminated NPC given radical radiotherapy between 1984 and 1989 was studied for the incidence of tongue cancer and other malignancies during follow-up. A contemporary cohort of 87 patients with tongue cancer, without a history of NPC, was studied for demographic data, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption habits. These were then compared with all the NPC patients and with the NPC patients who later developed tongue cancers. There was a significantly increased number of tongue cancers following radiotherapy for NPC. The risk of developing tongue cancer after radiotherapy for NPC was 0.13% per patient per year. There was no increase in the number of other malignancies. The association between NPC and tongue cancer was that of a non-random temporal sequence with tongue cancers following NPC but not in the reverse order. The demographic data and smoking and alcohol consumption history of the 7 NPC patients who subsequently developed tongue cancer were significantly different from the de novo tongue cancer patient population. The absence of common aetiological factors between NPC and tongue cancer and the non-random sequence of tongue cancers occurring after NPC suggests that these seven tongue cancers could be radiation induced. The estimated radiation dose received by the part of the tongue developing cancer was substantial and significantly higher than the dose to the cancer-free tongue. An increase of tongue cancers after radiotherapy for NPC is reported and arguments are made in support of the hypothesis that these were radiation- induced malignancies. We suggest a decrease in the volume of tongue included within the planning target volume of NPC in the absence of oropharyngeal and/or parapharyngeal infiltration. Awareness of the association should make early diagnosis of this likely radiation-induced cancer possible.

0032699828	Late radiation injury to the temporal lobes: Morphologic evaluation at MR imaging	PURPOSE: To study the morphologic characteristics of late radiation injury to the temporal lobes of the brain on magnetic resonance (MR) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study involving 34 patients (age range, 37-72 years) with known radiation injury to the temporal lobes from radiation therapy administered 2-10 years previously for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MR imaging was performed with T2-weighted gradient- and spin-echo, gradient-recalled echo, T1-weighted spin-echo, fluid-attenuated inversion- recovery, and T1-weighted postcontrast spin-echo sequences. RESULTS: Radiation injury was present in 57 of the 68 temporal lobes. The white matter lesions in radiation-induced injury were predominantly hyperintense on T2- weighted images, but in 37 (65%) of the 57 lobes, loci with heterogeneous signal intensity consistent with necrosis were detected. In the 57 involved lobes, gray matter lesions were detected in 50 (88%); blood-brain barrier disruption based on parenchymal contrast enhancement, in 51 (89%); and hemosiderin deposits, in 30 (53%). There was a significant correlation between white matter necrosis, gray matter lesions, and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which were located mainly in the inferior temporal lobes that received the highest radiation dose. CONCLUSION: The lesion components of radiation-induced injury to the temporal lobes at MR imaging were more varied than have been previously described. In addition to the classic white matter lesions, gray matter lesions, blood-brain barrier disruption, and hemosiderin deposition also were frequently seen.

0032726209	Altered expression of the suppressors PML and p53 in glioblastoma cells with the antisense-EGF-receptor	Gene amplification and enhanced expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represent the major molecular genetic alteration in glioblastomas and it may play an essential role in cell growth and in the carcinogenic process. On the other hand, the nuclear suppressor proteins PML and p53 are also known to play critical roles in cancer development and in suppressing cell growth. Here we report that, in glioblastoma cells with defective EGFR function, the expressions of both promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) and p53 were altered. Cells that were transfected with the antisense-cDNA of EGFR were found to have more cells in G1 and fewer cells in S phase. In addition, the transfected cells were found to be non-responsive to EGF-induced cell growth. Interestingly, the expression of the suppressors p53 and PML were found to be significantly increased by immunohistochemical assay in the antisense-EGFR cells. Moreover, the PML expression in many of the cells was converted from the nuclear dot pattern into fine-granulated staining pattern. In contrast, the expressions of other cell cycle regulated genes and proto-oncogene, including the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4), retinoblastoma, p16(INK4a) and p21(H-ras), were not altered. These data indicate that there are specific inductions of PML and p53 proteins which may account for the increase in G1 and growth arrest in antisense-EGFR treated cells. It also indicates that the EGF, p53 and PML transduction pathways were linked and they may constitute an integral part of an altered growth regulatory programme. The interactions and cross-talks of these critical molecules may be very important in regulating cell growth, differentiation and cellular response to treatment in glioblastomas.

Serial ultrasonography was performed in 18 patients with palpable nodal metastases in the neck who underwent radiotherapy for NPC. All patients had a pre-radiotherapy baseline and another study at least one year after radiotherapy. The largest node in each patient was evaluated for any change in the ultrasonographic features following radiotherapy. One year after radiotherapy nodes returned to normal size for their respective areas, the shape of the node and the echogenic hilus also reverted to normal. However, the nodes are more echogenic than nodes in normal subjects. This distinguishes these nodes from nodes not affected by radiotherapy. The histological basis for this observation is presumed to be the result of fibrosis. At first glance the post-radiotherapy nodes may resemble normal nodes, however subtle changes within the node and adjacent soft tissues can be recognized on ultrasonography. During long-term follow-up, the appearance of nodes at sites previously uninvolved or any change in the appearance of nodes should alert the sonologist to the possibility of recurrence.

0032763781	Assessing chemotherapy response of squamous cell oesophageal carcinoma with spiral CT	45 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus were examined prior to, and following, pre-operative chemotherapy by spiral CT. Oesophageal CT was performed following gaseous distention of the oesophagus. TNM stage and perceived resectability on CT before and after chemotherapy were compared and related to surgical resectability and pathological staging. T-stage changed in 26% and N-stage changed in 9% of tumours after chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapy CT predicted pathological T-stage with an accuracy of 88% and N-stage with an accuracy of 84%. Six of 14 tumours considered irresectable on CT pre-chemotherapy were considered resectable on post-chemotherapy CT. Five of these six tumours were resectable at surgery. Post-chemotherapy CT predicted surgical resectability with an accuracy of 88%, the main pitfall being underestimation and overestimation of tracheobronchial invasion. CT prediction of chemotherapy response as judged by change in tumour volume was compared with a quantitative pathological assessment of chemotherapy response. 93% of oesophageal tumours changed volume after chemotherapy with 51% having a volume reduction of ≥ 50%. However, no correlation was found between tumour volume reduction on serial CT examinations and either a quantitative pathological assessment of tumour response or patient survival.

0032767466	MRI of local disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Tumour extent vs tumour stage	The purpose was to use MRI to study in detail local tumour extension in patients presenting with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and to compare the extent of local disease with the current T-stage classification. MR images of 150 patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma were obtained on a 1.5 T unit. 10 extranasopharyngeal sites were analysed for tumour involvement. The number of concurrently involved sites was determined. The extent of tumour invasion was compared with staging as defined by the fifth edition of the AJCC classification. The T-stage distribution was T1 21%, T2 16%, T3 41%:, and T3 22%. The frequencies of tumour invasion into an individual site, and the mean number of other concurrently involved sites were as follows: skull base 63%, 3.9 sites; parapharyngeal 56%, 3.9 sites; nasal cavity 53%, 4.0 sites. oropharyngeal 17%,, 5.2 sites; sphenoid sinus 27%,. 5.6 sites: cranium 21%, 5.7 sites, infratemporal fossa 2%, 6.3 sites; ethmoid sinus 14%, 6.5 sites; orbit 5%, 7.0 sites; maxillary sinus 5%, 7.1 sites, and hypopharynx 0%, 0 sites. Extranasopharyngeal extension commonly occurred superiorly into the skull base rather than inferiorly to the oropharynx (p < 0.0001). Anatomical sites defined within the same T-stage category had different frequencies of involvement and different frequencies of concurrently involved sites. Oropharyngeal involvement (T2 stage) was associated with a number of concurrently involved sites comparable to structures in the T3 category. Maxillary and ethmoid sinus involvement (T3 stage) were associated with a number of involved sites comparable to the T4 stage. Invasion of the maxillary antrum and orbit are markers of the most bulky form of NPC.

0033513092	Metastatic adenopathy from nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Successful response to radiation therapy assessed by color duplex sonography	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the role of gray-scale sonography for neck nodes is well documented, it plays a limited role in the evaluation of nodal response to treatment. This preliminary limited study sought to determine color duplex sonographic changes in successfully treated metastatic nodes from nasopharyngeal carcinoma. METHODS: Fourteen patients with nodal metastases from nasopharyngeal carcinoma were studied. A pretreatment sonogram was obtained for all patients. Patients were divided into two groups of seven: in one group, repeat sonograms were obtained 8 weeks after completion of treatment; in the second group, sonograms were obtained 16 weeks after treatment. The features studied included distribution of intranodal vascularity, resistive and pulsatility indexes, and peak systolic velocity. In 11 patients, follow-up sonograms were obtained 1 year after treatment. RESULTS: The majority (90%) of malignant nodes from nasopharyngeal carcinoma have an increased central and peripheral vascularity, a high resistive index (0.8), and a high pulsatility index (1.8). After radiation therapy to the nodes, a reduction in intranodal vascularity and a statistically significant reduction in the resistive index (0.58 to 0.59) and pulsatility index (0.91 to 0.93) are found. Although a similar reduction in the peak systolic velocity is observed, it is not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that after radiation therapy for malignant nodes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a reduction in intranodal vascularity is found, and the resistive and pulsatility indexes may return to benign parameters as early as 8 weeks after completion of treatment.

0032816406	Detection of recurrent chromosomal gains and losses in primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma by comparative genomic hybridisation	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer in Southern China but rare in Western countries. To search for genetic alterations in NPC, we examined a series of 20 primary tumours with comparative genomic hybridisation. The identified common chromosomal alterations included gain of chromosomes 1q, 8, 12, 19 and 20 as well as loss of chromosomes 1p, 3p, 9p, 9q, 11q, 13q, 14q and 16q. In concordance with our previous loss of heterozygosity studies in primary NPC, a high incidence of loss was detected on chromosomes 3p (75%), 11q (70%) and 14q (65%). Losses of 9q (60%), 13q (50%) and 16q (40%) were also identified. Novel chromosomal gains were observed on chromosome 12, with a high frequency (70%). Current analysis has revealed a comprehensive profile of the chromosomal regions showing losses and gains in primary NPC. Our findings may provide an entry point for conducting further investigations to locate the putative tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes that may be involved in the tumourigenesis of NPC.

0032845418	Hypoglossal nerve palsy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background. The aim of the study was to use magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine the cause of hypoglossal nerve palsy and the sites of injury in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before radiation therapy and during postradiation therapy follow-up. Methods. The clinical records and MR studies of 21 patients with hypoglossal nerve palsy were retrospectively studied. These 21 patients belonged to a cohort of 387 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (153 with newly diagnosed disease and 234 on postradiation follow-up) who underwent MR imaging in a 2.5-year period. Results. Four patients had hypoglossal nerve palsy at initial diagnosis and all of them had extensive skull base invasion from tumor extending postero- inferiorly to the level of the foramen magnum. The nerve was invaded in the carotid sheath (3), hypoglossal nerve canal (3), and premedullary cistern (1). In 17 patients developing hypoglossal nerve palsy after radiotherapy, only two (12%) had evidence of tumor recurrence. Radiation-induced neuropathy was the probable cause in 14 patients and 1 case was judged indeterminate. MR evidence of fibrosis was demonstrable along the course the nerve in four patients (29%), involving the carotid sheath (4), hypoglossal nerve canal (2), and premedullary cistern (1). No patient had MR evidence of radiation change in the brain stem. Seven patients had a history of a boost dose of radiation to the parapharyngeal region on one or both sides, and nerve palsy occurred on the boosted side in six of them. Conclusion. Hypoglossal nerve palsy on presentation was caused by locally advanced nasopharyngeal tumor whereas a palsy arising after radiation therapy was more frequently caused by postradiation damage rather than cancer.

0033559576	Quantitative analysis of cell-free Epstein-Barr virus DNA in plasma of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Using real-time quantitative PCR, cell-free EBV DNA was detectable in the plasma of 96% (55 of 57) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients (median concentration, 21058 copies/ml) and 7% (3 of 43) of controls (median concentration, 0 copies/ml). Advanced-stage NPC patients had higher plasma EBV DNA levels than those with early-stage disease. At 1 month after completion of radiotherapy, plasma EBV DNA was undetectable in 7 of 15 subjects (47%) but remained high in the remaining 8 subjects (53%). Clinical examination revealed that all of the former seven subjects had complete tumor regression, whereas six of the eight latter subjects exhibited evidence of disease persistence or had developed distant metastases. These results suggest that quantitative analysis of plasma EBV DNA may be a useful clinical and research tool in the screening and monitoring of NPC patients.

0033229898	Quantitative and temporal correlation between circulating cell-free Epstein-Barr virus DNA and tumor recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Recently, cell-free EBV DNA has been detected in the plasma and serum of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We studied the relationship between plasma/serum EBV DNA and tumor recurrence. Using real-time quantitative PCR, the median plasma EBV DNA concentration in 10 patients with tumor recurrence was determined to be 32,350 copies/ml, whereas that in 15 patients in continuous remission for a mean period of 2 years was 0 copy/ml. Longitudinal follow-up of 17 NPC patients revealed 6 individuals with tumor recurrence and 11 patients who remained in remission. Significant elevations in serum EBV DNA, sometimes up to 6 months before detectable clinical deterioration, were observed in the patients who subsequently developed tumor recurrence. Continuously low or undetectable levels of serum EBV DNA were observed in the patients who remained in remission. These results suggest that plasma/serum cell-free EBV DNA may be a valuable tool for the monitoring of NPC patients for the early detection of tumor recurrence.

0032891678	Submental metastases from nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The primary treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radiotherapy. Despite optimal treatment the incidence of recurrent persistent or recurrent regional disease is significant. It is believed that recurrent regional disease is usually associated with local disease. Recurrent nodal disease commonly involves the subdigastric and upper jugular region and submental involvement is less common. This study includes 25 patients who had palpable submental nodes 2 years or more after radiotherapy. Five of the seven patients with proven malignant submental nodal recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma had no other evidence of disease. Ultrasound accurately identified enlarged nodes and correctly predicted involvement. The ultra-sound appearances of these nodes and their impact on management and prognosis is discussed.

0032903071	Magnetic resonance imaging of the eustachian tube in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Correlation of patterns of spread with middle ear effusion	Objective: The purpose of this study was to use multiplanar high- resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detail the patterns of tumor spread in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and to correlate the findings with the presence of an effusion in the middle ear and mastoid. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 51 patients with newly diagnosed NPC, providing 102 individual sides for analysis. Results: Fifty- nine lateral walls of the nasopharynx were involved by NPC. Tumor involved the lateral recess (55), eustachian tube orifice (41), levator palatini (LP) (32), torus tubarius (TT) (21), pharyngobasilar fascia (38), tensor palatini (TP) (17), parapharyngeal fat space (PFS) (19), main body of the cartilaginous eustachian tube (CET) (13), bony eustachian tube (0), middle ear (0), and inner ear (0). Effusions were present in 32 (54%) of the 59 involved sides. Effusions were found to be associated with the following patterns of spread: tumor causing major displacement of the CET without invasion (3 of 4), tumor invading TT or LP with minor displacement of the TT (4 of 7) or major displacement of the CET (7 of 7) and advanced invasion involving the TP, PFS, or CET with major displacement of CET (18 of 19). Effusions were not seen in tumors without invasion that were restricted to the lateral recess or eustachian tube orifice either with no displacement (0 of 11) or with minor displacement (0 of 11) of the TT. Effusions were present in 28 of 30 cases with major displacement of the main body of the CET, 4 of 18 with minor displacement of the TT, and 0 of 11 with no displacement. Displacement of the eustachian tube was a significant factor in the production of an effusion (p < 0.00001) and remained significant even after exclusion of all cases of advanced invasion (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The cause of an effusion in NPC is multifactorial. Magnetic resonance imaging has shown invasion of the tensor palatini muscle in patients with an effusion, suggesting a functional cause. However, displacement of the eustachian tube is a significant factor in patients with middle ear and mastoid effusions.

0032934047	Magnetic resonance imaging and audiologic assessment of middle ear effusions in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before radiation therapy	Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of clinical methods, viz. otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry, and tympanometry in diagnosing middle ear effusions (MEEs) using magnetic resonance imaging as a reference standard. Study Design: A retrospective study of 46 patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma was performed comparing clinical evaluation and audiometry results with magnetic resonance imaging findings obtained before radiation therapy. Results: Twenty-two (25%) of the temporal bones imaged had both MEE and mastoid effusions, 24 (27%) had only middle ear fluid, and 29 (33%) had mastoid fluid alone. The sensitivity for tympanometry, audiometry, and otoscopy in detecting fluid in the middle ear was 96%, 92%, and 80%, respectively. Although tympanometry was most sensitive in diagnosing MEE, there was no statistically significant difference when comparing the overall accuracy of pure-tone audiometry air-bone gap and tympanometry (p = 0.7, chi-square test). Flat curve tympanograms (type B) only achieved a sensitivity of 45% but were of high specificity (92%). Forty- nine percent with negative pressure tympanograms (mean air pressures > -100 daPa) had no MEE. Conclusions: Using magnetic resonance imaging as a reference standard, tympanometry is the most sensitive audiologic test in detecting the presence of MEE. The overall accuracy of tympanometry, pure- tone audiometry air-bone gap, and otologic examination was, however, not significantly different.

0034046778	Staging computed tomography of the thorax for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background. To assess the role of staging CT of the thorax in advanced nodal stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma and to examine the hypothesis that contiguous spread of nodal metastases from the supraclavicular region to the upper mediastinal region occurs in this cancer. Methods. Forty-four patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma with neck node metastases to the supraclavicular region (ie, AJCC N3b stage) underwent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) thorax for staging. CT findings and clinical outcome were analyzed. Results. No patient was found to have intrathoracic metastasis, although 1 had hepatic metastases on CECT of the thorax, resulting in upstaging in 1 of 44 (2%) of patients. With a median follow-up time of 21 months, 3 patients had lung metastases and 2 had axillary nodal metastases develop without evidence of upper mediastinal nodal metastases. Conclusion. Staging CECT of the thorax has a very low yield in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, even in advanced nodal disease. The hypothesis that contiguous spread of nodal metastases from the supraclavicular region to the upper mediastinum is not substantiated, and no evidence suggests that radiation therapy for N3b-stage disease needs to encompass the upper mediastinum.

0034087019	Dysphagia in treated nasopharyngeal cancer	Objectives. To investigate the prevalence of long-term dysphagia in patients treated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by radiotherapy. Study Design. Questionnaire-based assessment, clinical examination, and videofluoroscopic assessment of 50 patients, ages 26 to 75 years (average, 49 years), treated for NPC 12 to 119 months (average, 56 months) previously with no evidence of disease recurrence. Methods. Administered questionnaire assessment of patients eating and swallowing. Clinical examination by a single experienced clinician. Videofluoroscopy was used to record swallowing of solid, paste, and liquid bolus. Pharyngeal transit time (PTT) was recorded, and the video recordings were assessed by two experienced observers for abnormalities. Results. Fifty patients completed the questionnaire and were examined. Seventy-six percent reported dysphagia, 97% had xerostomia, and 78% had no gag reflex. Forty-nine patients underwent videofluoroscopy. Abnormal pharyngeal contraction was observed on videofluoroscopy in 93% of the subjects. Silent aspiration was observed in 22% of the patients. PTT was prolonged from a normal of 1 second to 1.9 seconds for solid, 1.7 seconds for paste, and 1.3 seconds for liquid consistencies. Conclusions. Subjective and objective swallowing abnormalities are common after radiotherapy for NPC. The implications of this finding and possible causes are discussed.(C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

0033754521	Serum fatty acid, lipid profile and dietary intake of Hong Kong Chinese omnivores and vegetarians	Objective: To examine the serum fatty acid and lipid profiles and dietary intake of Hong Kong Chinese omnivores and vegetarians with respect to cardiovascular health. Design: Random population survey stratified by age and sex. Subjects: One-hundred and ninety-four omnivore subjects (81 men, 113 women) age 25-70 y, and 60 ovo-lacto-vegetarian adults (15 men, 45 women) age 30-55 y. Measurements: Nutrient quantitation was by a food frequency method. Serum fatty acids were analysed by gas chromatography, and serum lipid by standard laboratory methods. Results: Compared with omnivores, vegetarians had higher serum concentrations of polyunsaturated (PUFA) and monosaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and lower saturated fatty acids (SFA), long chain omega-3 and trans fatty acids (TFA). They also had lower serum cholesterol and higher apoA-I concentrations, but the LDL/HDL ratio was not different. The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids intake was higher in vegetarians. Compared with results from populations with higher incidences of coronary heart disease, while lower myristic and palmitic acid concentrations and higher eicosapentaneoic (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) may partly account for the difference in incidence, linoleic acid concentration was higher. Although the Chinese vegetarian diet may be beneficial for heart health in that antioxidant and fibre intakes are higher and saturated fat lower, the low EPA and DHA due to omission from dietary source and suppressed formation by high linoleic acid level, and the presence of TFA in the diet, may exert an opposite effect. Conclusion: There are some favourable features in the serum fatty acid profile in the Hong Kong Chinese population with respect to cardiovascular health, but the consumption of TFA is of concern. The Chinese vegetarian diet also contains some adverse features.

0033755181	Middle ear effusions after radiotherapy: Correlation with pre-radiotherapy nasopharyngeal tumor patterns	Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess whether pretreatment tumor patterns of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) can predict the status of the middle ear after radiation treatment. Materials and Methods: Pretreatment and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 32 patients (64 ears) who had radiation therapy for NPC. For the purpose of analysis, the ears were placed into their pre-radiation therapy tumor pattern groups and the presence of middle ear effusion (MEE) with regard to eustachian tube (ET) invasion or displacement was identified. Results: MEEs were present in 31 (48.4%) ears after radiation therapy. All of the MEEs that resolved were in the preradiation therapy groups where tumor invasion of the eustachian tube was present irrespective of the amount of ET displacement. There was, however, no significant difference for resolved MEEs between ears with ET invasion or displacement (p = 0.32 and p = 0.7l, respectively, Fisher's exact test). The MEEs occurred with significantly greater frequency in ears with minor ET displacement than in those with major ET displacement (p = 0.013, Fisher's exact test) as well as in previously normal ears compared with other groups (p = 0.008, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusion: A pre-radiation therapy NPC tumor pattern was not found that clearly predicted the outcome of MEE after radiation treatment. The findings, however, suggest that approximately one third of MEEs in patients with invasion of ET or paratubal structures, irrespective of the amount of ET displacement, resolve after therapy. The MEEs that were present in ears with ET displacement and no invasion did not resolve despite reversal of the displacement after treatment, which suggests that ET position plays a less important role than invasion in the resolution of MEE. It is, however, difficult to be certain, because ears with invasion were invariably associated with ET displacement, and the contribution of radiation therapy to the development of MEE further complicates the issue.

0034192364	Kinetics of plasma Epstein-barr virus DNA during radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	We studied the kinetics of circulating EBV DNA in the plasma of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Serial weekly sampling of 10 NPC patients revealed a rapid decline in plasma EBV DNA concentration after treatment. In two subjects, an initial rise in the circulating EBV DNA level was observed immediately after treatment initiation. Plasma EBV DNA levels were monitored daily during the first treatment week in a second cohort of five patients, and the results indicated that an initial rise in plasma EBV DNA concentration could be observed in all subjects during the first treatment week. This observation is consistent with the liberation of EBV DNA after therapy-induced cancer cell death. After this initial rise, plasma EBV DNA concentration was found to decay with a median half-life of 3.8 days (interquartile range, 2.4-4.4 days). Kinetic analysis of circulating tumor- derived DNA during treatment may be a powerful tool for evaluating the in vivo response of NPC and other tumors to antineoplastic treatment and may improve our understanding of the biology of plasma nucleic acids.

0034235814	CTL control of EBV in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC): EBV-specific CTL responses in the blood and tumors of NPC patients and the antigen-processing function of the tumor cells	Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is latently infected with EBV and expresses a restricted number of viral proteins. Studies in healthy virus carriers have demonstrated that at least some of these proteins can act as targets for HLA class I-restricted CTLs. Therefore we have explored the possibility of a CTL-based therapy for NPC by characterizing EBV-specific CTL responses in 10 newly diagnosed NPC cases and 21 healthy virus carriers from Southeast Asia. Using the autologous EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line, virus-specific CTL were reactivated in vitro from PBMC, cloned, and screened for cytotoxicity against target cells expressing individual EBV proteins from recombinant vaccinia vectors. EBV-specific CTLs were identified in 6 of 10 patients and 14 of 21 controls and mainly targeted the EBV nuclear Ag 3 (EBNA3) family of viral latent proteins. However, in 3 of 10 patients and 11 of 21 controls, CTLs specific for the NPC-associated protein LMP2 were also detected, albeit at low frequency. EBV-specific CTLs were detected in tumor biopsy material obtained from 3 of 6 of the patients, indicating that functional CTL are present at the tumor site, but none was specific for tumor-associated viral proteins. To assess the Ag-presenting function in NPC we studied two NPC-derived cell lines (C15 and c666.1) and demonstrated that both were capable of processing and presenting endogenously synthesized protein to HLA class I-restricted CTL clones. Overall, our data provide a sound theoretical basis for therapeutic strategies that aim to boost or elicit LMP2-specific CTL responses in NPC patients.

0033966886	Lack of expression for the suppressor PML in human small cell lung carcinoma	The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene, which encodes a transformation and growth suppressor, was first identified at the chromosomal translocation break point t(15;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (PML). To determine if the PML gene might be involved in other neoplasias such as lung cancer, PML expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization. Considerable PML protein expression in the PML-oncogenic domain (POD) structure was found in adenocarcinomas (ADC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the lung, but was almost completely absent in all the small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) examined. In situ hybridization showed that both mRNA and DNA of PML were present in SCLC and in normal lung, suggesting that the decreased protein expression was due to either a defect in translation or protein instability, rather than the consequence of decreased transcription or gene deletion. Double staining showed that PML expression was inversely correlated with the proliferation marker Ki-67 and positively correlated with levels of apoptotic cells in these tumors. To determine if the precursor cells of SCLC, the neuroendocrine-producing cells, express PML, double labeling was performed with PML and chromogranin A, a bio-marker for neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells from normal tissues were found to be PML positive, indicating that the lack of PML protein in SCLC is associated with the tumorigenic phenotype and is not the result of cell- lineage specificity. Thus, the decreased PML expression may play an important role in SCLC development. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0033981020	Frequent c-myc and Int-2 overrepresentations in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a commonly occurring tumor in southern China. Although several causative factors have now been recognized, the genetic basis underlying its tumorigenesis is still unclear. To identify potential chromosomal aberrations for further investigations, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was applied to the study of genomic imbalances in 10 NPC biopsy specimens. Before CGH analysis, the tumor cell content within the biopsy specimens was enriched by tissue microdissection, and universal genome amplification was performed on the recovered DNA. Recurrent chromosomal gains were detected on 1q (6 of 10 cases), 2q (5 of 10 cases), 3q (7 of 10 cases), 6p (8 of 10 cases), 6q (5 of 10 cases), 7q11.2 (4 of 10 cases), 8q (6 of 10 cases), 11q13, 12, and 15q (8 of 10 cases each), 17q (6 of 10 cases), and 20q (5 of 10 cases). Common losses were identified on 3p (5 of 10 cases), 9p (5 of 10 cases), 11q14-qter (8 of 10 cases), and 14q (5 of 10 cases). Among these aberrations, 7, 8, and 11 gains were further investigated on a series of NPC tissue samples, by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), for the incidence of α-satellites: 7, 8, and 11 c-myc and Int-2. Low-level increases of α-satellite 7 (9 of 34 cases; 26.5%), α-satellite 8 (15 of 34 cases; 44%), and α-satellite 11 (8 of 32 cases; 25%) were detected, whereas high-level copy gains of c-myc (21 of 34 cases; 62%) and Int-2 (26 of 34 cases; 76.5%) were more frequently found. Our series is the first to identify genomic overrepresentations of c-myc and Int- 2 in NPC. The high incidence of Int-2 amplifications strongly suggests a role of this proto-oncogene in the pathogenesis of NPC. (C) 2000 W.B. Saunders Company.

0033994159	Neck node metastases from nasopharyngeal carcinoma: MR imaging of patterns of disease	Background. The purpose was to use MR imaging to document the patterns of nodal involvement in the upper neck in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods. The MR images of 150 patients with newly diagnosed NPC were reviewed retrospectively. Nodes were considered abnormal on MR criteria of size, necrosis, and extracapsular spread. Results. Retropharyngeal nodes (RN) were more frequently involved than nonretropharyngeal nodes (NRNs) (94% vs 76% in 115 patients with nodal metastases). NRN involvement without RN was seen in only 7 of 115 patients (6%). Involvement of RN at the level of the oropharynx (82%) was as common as at the nasopharynx (83%) level. Internal jugular nodes were the most frequently involved NRN nodes (72%). Spinal accessory nodal involvement was also common (57%) but seldom in isolation (8%). Submandibular (3%) and parotid (2%) nodal metastases were uncommon and were always associated with advanced nodal metastases in the ipsilateral RN, internal jugular, and spinal accessory regions. Conclusion. Retropharyngeal nodes are the first echelons of nodal metastases. Direct lymphatic spread to the neck without involvement of the RN nodes is uncommon. RN metastases at the level of the oropharynx are more common than previously suspected, and this should influence radiotherapy planning. NRN outside the internal jugular and spinal accessory chains are rare and only occur when the usual routes of lymphatic spread have already been blocked by tumor. (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

39049168536	Clinical encounter experiences of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a commonly occurring cancer among Hong Kong Chinese, especially in the relatively young population group. Since the disease carries a favorable prognosis, sequelae following treatment have become an important concern for patients suffering from NPC, particularly because of the strong interplay of psychological, social, and biological issues during their rehabilitation. In this qualitative study, in-depth, semistructured audiotaped interviews were undertaken with 32 patients receiving rehabilitation at the physiotherapy department of a regional teaching hospital in Hong Kong. The objective of the study was to examine the rehabilitation experiences of NPC survivors to identify factors that contributed to a satisfying clinical encounter experience. During the study, data collection and analysis using a grounded theory approach were concurrently conducted. The 3 main themes that shaped the rehabilitation experiences of NPC survivors were the patient-clinician relationship, participation in therapeutic alliance, and quality rehabilitation service provision. These, together with the identified needs of the participants, contributed to the participants' perceived health-related quality of life. A constructive clinical experience was perceived when their needs were met. The findings highlight the importance of patient-centeredness in the treatment delivery and a multifaceted role of clinicians in meeting the needs of this group of cancer survivors. © 2008 Sage Publications.

33644859877	Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging in late radiation-induced injury of the brain	The objective of the study was to evaluate radiation-induced cerebral injury on dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSCE) perfusion MR imaging and study its relationship with morphological severity and disease progression. Thirty-one patients with known radiation injury to the temporal lobes where studied. Gradient and spin-echo T2-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and DSCE perfusion MR imaging were obtained in the coronal plane through the anterior temporal lobe. Regions of interest where selected in the anterior temporal lobes and the superior frontal lobe as control for analysis of perfusion parameters. The mean transit time (MTT) was prolonged in both the High Dose Zone (HDZ) receiving from two-thirds to the total dose of 66-71. 2 Gy, and the Intermediary Dose Zone (IDZ) receiving up to 87% of the total dose. The HDZ but not the IDZ showed a low relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow index (rCBFi). The rCBV and rCBFi were significantly lower in both HDZ and LBZ in temporal lobes with severe lesions compared to the temporal lobes with mild lesions but there was no significant difference in bolus transit parameters. The rCBV and rCBFi were significantly lower in both HDZ and IDZ of the swollen temporal lobes compared to those without swelling. It was concluded that DSCE perfusion MR imaging demonstrated a derangement in perfusion in radiation-induced cerebral injury in rCBV, rCBFi and MTT, which were related to the severity of the radiation-induced injury and the dose of irradiation delivered. © 2005 Springer-Verlag.

33644874070	A comparison of wound treatments in nasopharyngeal cancer patients receiving radiation therapy	The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of gentian violet and nonadherent absorbent dressing in the healing of postirradiation wounds in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. This was a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 146 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had developed postirradiation wounds was assessed. Comparisons were made regarding parameters related to wound healing, including healing time, presence of infection, and wound pain, and also regarding the impact of wound on the patient, including mood changes, restriction of neck movement, social isolation, sleep problem, and disturbance in body image. The results showed that patients in the 2 groups did not have any significant difference on wound-healing time, disturbance in mood, sleep, social interaction, appearance, and neck mobility. However, there was a trend of higher wound pain score, not reaching statistical significance, in the gentian violet group. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34248587188	Adjuvant Chemoradiation for Gastric Cancer: Experience in the Chinese Population	Aims: The role of adjuvant chemoradiation for gastric cancer after curative R0 gastrectomy was first established by the US Intergroup 0116 study. Although confirmatory studies are in progress, few data are available regarding its application to the Chinese population. We describe our radiotherapy technique and report the treatment results in Hong Kong. Materials and methods: This was a single centre retrospective study on 63 Chinese patients who underwent adjuvant chemoradiation for gastric adenocarcinoma between June 2000 and December 2004. The treatment protocol was based on that of the Intergroup study. Computed tomography planned anteroposterior opposing field arrangement and treatment under breath hold at deep inspiration position were adopted. Results: In total, 63 patients, mean age 50 years, with gastric cancer stage IB to limited metastatic IV disease were analysed. The median follow-up time was 27.2 months. The relapse-free survival and overall survival at 3 years were 50 and 54%, respectively. The recurrence pattern was dominated by distant failure and only one patient developed isolated locoregional recurrence. Of the 10 patients who had positive microscopic surgical margins after surgery, seven had recurred and died. On multivariate analysis, margin status was the only significant prognosticator for survival. Thirty per cent of patients experienced grade 3 or above acute toxicity (24% haematological, 14% gastrointestinal) and one patient died of neutropenic sepsis. There was one case of grade 3 late toxicity. Conclusions: The outcome after adjuvant chemoradiation for gastric cancer seemed to be favourable, with manageable toxicities, in the Chinese population. Locoregional failure was uncommon. Patients with microscopic surgical margin involvement had a very high failure rate despite adjuvant chemoradiation. © 2007 The Royal College of Radiologists.

0034281856	Assessment of neck tissue fibrosis using an ultrasound palpation system: A feasibility study	Fibrotic change in the soft tissue of the neck is a common side-effect after radiotherapy treatment for cancers of the head and neck region. The development of a quantitative approach for the assessment of neck tissue stiffness using an ultrasound palpation system (UPS) is reported. A testing protocol was established with the participation of eight normal subjects and four patients who had neck fibrosis after previous radiotherapy to the neck. Six reference sites were assessed on each side of the neck in each subject. Site-dependence, inter-observer variability, and intra-observer variability were further evaluated by measurement of sites 1 cm anterior, posterior, superior and inferior to two of the reference sites on each side of the neck, and by repeating measurements using a second observer on the same occasion and using the same observer one week afterwards. The mean tissue Young's modulus for normal subjects was 12.8±3.9 kPa, and that of the radiotherapy-treated patients ranged from 46.4 to 108.3 kPa. The modulus shows limited variation among anatomical sub-sites within the neck. For a confidence level of 95%, there was a variation of ±14.2% for site-dependence, ±15.2% for inter-observer, and ±7.2% for intra-observer tests for the group of normal subjects. The variation in the patients was ±13.6% for site-dependence, and ±13.1% for the inter-observer test.

0034564112	Final report of a randomized trial on altered-fractionated radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma prematurely terminated by significant increase in neurologic complications	Purpose: The aim of the present study was to compare the survival, local control and complications of conventional/accelerated-hyperfractionated radiotherapy and conventional radiotherapy in nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Methods and Materials: From February 1993 to October 1995, 159 patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic (M0) NPC with N0 or 4 cm or less N1 disease (Ho's N-stage classification, 1978) were randomized to receive either conventional radiotherapy (Arm I, n = 82) or conventional/accelerated-hyperfractionated radiotherapy (Arm II, n = 77). Stratification was according to the T stage. The biologic effective dose (10 Grays) to the primary and the upper cervical lymphatics were 75.0 and 73.1 for Arm I and 84.4 and 77.2 for Arm II, respectively.Results: With comparable distribution among the T stages between the two arms, the free from local failure rate at 5 years after radiotherapy was not significantly different between the two arms (85.3%; 95% confidence interval, 77.2-93.4% for Arm I; and 88.9%; 95% confidence interval, 81.7-96.2% for Arm II). The two arms were also comparable in overall survival, relapse-free survival, and rates of distant metastasis and regional relapse. Conventional/accelerated-hyperfractionated radiotherapy was associated with significantly increased radiation-induced damage to the central nervous system (including temporal lobe, cranial nerves, optic nerve/chiasma, and brainstem/spinal cord) in Arm II. Although insignificant, radiation-induced cranial nerve(s) palsy (typically involving VIII-XII), trismus, neck soft tissue fibrosis, and hypopituiturism and hypothyroidism occurred more often in Arm II. In addition, the complications occurred at significantly shorter intervals after radiotherapy in Arm II.Conclusion: Accelerated hyperfractionation when used in conjunction with a two-dimensional radiotherapy planning technique, in this case the Ho's technique, resulted in increased radiation damage to the central nervous system without significant improvement in efficacy.

0034880414	Clinically underdetected asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis as a late complication of radiotherapy in Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	Background. Carotid artery stenosis is a late complication of radiotherapy to the neck region. This complication has, however, a significant impact with increased risk of stroke causing mortality and morbidity. Clinicians' awareness of this complication and early detection is therefore important. Methods. Eighty patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who had received radiotherapy were recruited for color Doppler ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, fifty-eight patients with newly diagnosed NPC who had never received any radiotherapy were recruited as controls. All patients with significant carotid stenosis were referred to the neurology clinic for further assessment. Results. Twenty-four patients were found to have more than 50% diameter reduction in the extracranial carotid artery. Clinical assessment by a neurologist showed 9 of 24 patients had a history of transient ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, or stroke. Seven of these patients had clinically detectable neck bruit. Conclusions. Clinicians attending to patients after radiotherapy for head and neck cancers should be aware of this long-term complication of radiotherapy. A detailed clinical history and incorporation of auscultation of carotid arteries in routine follow-up of postradiotherapy patients are recommended. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0034908571	In vivo diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma using contact rhinoscopy	Objectives: To evaluate the potential use of contact endoscopy for the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Study Design: Prospective study to examine the nasopharynx of 30 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 18 subjects with normal nasopharynx in a clinic setting using contact rhinoscopes (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany, 7215 AA, 0° and 7215 BA, 30°; 23 cm long; 4 mm in diameter). Methods: The superficial cells of the normal nasopharynx and the nasopharyngeal tumors were stained with 1% methylene blue and examined with contact rhinoscopes at high magnifications (x60 and x150). The areas under examination were then biopsied. The contact endoscopic images were compared with the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin-stained histologic sections of the biopsied tissues. Results: Sixty-six procedures were performed in 48 patients. The images of normal pseudostratified ciliated epithelium and squamous epithelium were readily recognized by contact endoscopy in all subjects with normal nasopharynx (10 men and 8 women; mean age, 51.9 y). Twenty-six of 30 patients with NPC (86.6%; 18 men and 8 women; mean age, 50.6 y) were successfully examined by contact endoscopy under local anesthesia. In these 26 patients, two patterns of malignant cells were identified with contact endoscopy. The patterns of contact endoscopic images corresponded well with the histologic findings. Conclusion: Contact endoscopy is an accurate and reliable office-based procedure, which allows for in-vivo diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

0034332923	Improved local control for early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma - A tale of two hospitals	Purpose: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and materials: All early T-stage (T1 and T2 nasal cavity tumour) NPC treated with a curative intent up to 1996 were analyzed (n=743), 163 from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and 25 from Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT; group A). They were compared with 555 patients treated with ERT alone (group B). The radiotherapy techniques were identical between the two hospitals. The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected biological equivalent dose (BED)-10, ≥75 Gy) to the primary tumour, and this did not differ in technique or dosage between the two groups. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources. Results: The local failure was significantly less (crude rates, 6.9 vs. 13.0%; 5-year actuarial rates, 5.8 vs. 11.7%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates, 13.8 vs. 18.9%; 5-year actuarial rates, 12.2 vs. 15.2%) in group A compared with group B. ICT was the only significant independent prognostic factor predictive of fewer local failures. When ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumour repopulation became significant in predicting the ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the rate of the chronic radiation complications. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship existed, plotting the local failure as a function of the total physical dose or the total BED. Conclusions: Supplementing ERT, which delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10, ≥75 Gy), with ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

0034671947	Molecular prognostication of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by quantitative analysis of circulating epstein-barr virus DNA	We investigated the prognostic implication of pretreatment plasma/ serum EBV DNA concentration, as measured by real-time quantitative PCR, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In 91 prospectively recruited NPC patients, those with recurrence or metastasis within the first year after treatment had a higher median plasma EBV DNA concentration than those without events (41,756 copies/ml versus 5,807 copies/ml; P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney rank-sum test). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma EBV DNA was an independent prognostic indicator for early clinical events [relative risk = 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.6-9.2 for each 10-fold increase in plasma EBV DNA concentration; P = 0.003)]. In a second cohort of 139 NPC patients followed-up for a median period of 2,027 days (interquartile range, 597-2,335 days), serum EBV DNA was found to be a significant variable associated with NPC-related death in multivariate Cox's regression analysis [relative risk = 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.1 for each 10-fold increase in serum EBV DNA concentration; P = 0.007)]. The quantitation of circulating EBV DNA may thus allow improved prognostication of NPC.

42149109105	A phase II study of patients with metastatic or locoregionally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma and evaluation of plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA as a biomarker of efficacy	Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gefitinib inhibits NPC growth in vitro. Method: Patients who progressed after prior platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent NPC were given gefitinib orally at 500 mg/day at a 28-day cycle. Plasma Epstein-Barr virus (pEBV) DNA levels were obtained at specific intervals. Results: Sixteen patients enrolled and 15 were evaluable for response. The median age was 49 years (range 34-64 years), and most patients were males with metastatic NPC. No objective response was seen and three patients had stable disease (SD) for 2.8 to 8.5 months. Radiological progression of disease coincided with rising levels of pEBV DNA in most patients, while the level of a patient with the longest duration of SD fell to an undetectable level at study completion. The mean time to progression and overall survival was 2.7 (standard error, SE +/- 0.5 months) and 12 months (SE +/- 1.7 months), respectively. No unexpected drug-related toxicities were seen. The study was prematurely terminated because there was insufficient activity to warrant progression to the second stage of accrual. Conclusion: This study found limited activity of gefitinib in recurrent NPC. Further evaluation of pEBV DNA as a biomarker of response in clinical trials of target-based agents is warranted. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

46749092937	MR imaging of nonmalignant polyps and masses of the nasopharynx and sphenoid sinus after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The development of a new polyp or mass in the radiation field of a previously treated carcinoma is usually an ominous sign of a recurrent cancer, but rarely may it be caused instead by a nonmalignant process. The purpose of this study was to document the MR appearance of unusual nonmalignant polyps or masses (NMPMs) in the nasopharynx and sphenoid sinus arising after radiation treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR imaging reports of patients undergoing imaging after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with unusual polyps and masses in the nasopharynx. The MR images of those patients with no evidence of malignancy on biopsy or follow-up were reviewed. RESULTS: The MR imaging reports of 1282 patients were reviewed, and 11 patients (1%) with NMPMs in the nasopharynx or sphenoid sinus were identified. Two patterns were identified: contrast enhancing nasopharyngeal polyps ranging in size from 1 to 5 cm (n = 5) and sphenoid sinus masses consisting of a nonenhancing mass filling a nonexpanded sinus (n = 4) and a heterogeneous enhancing mass expanding the sinus (n = 2). Osteoradionecrosis produced a large defect in the roof of the nasopharynx causing direct communication with the sphenoid sinus (n = 6). Histology revealed granulation tissue in all of the patients with variable amounts of fibrin and inflammatory cells. A direct infective etiology was not proved in any patient. CONCLUSION: NMPMs in the nasopharynx and sphenoid sinus are rare complications after radiation therapy to the skull base, but the radiologist needs to be aware of their appearance so that they can be considered in the differential diagnosis of suspected tumor recurrence.

48249096810	Persistent aberrations in circulating DNA integrity after radiotherapy are associated with poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	Purpose: Aberrations of circulating nucleic acid integrity have been observed in cancer patients. However, the clinical significance of such changes has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we investigated the plasma DNA integrity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients and its association with patients' survival after radiotherapy. Experimental Design: Plasma DNA integrity was analyzed for 105 NPC patients before and after curative-intent radiotherapy and for 40 healthy controls. The plasma DNA concentration of each sample was measured by two real-time PCRs targeting the leptin gene. The amplicon sizes of the two assays were 105 and 201 bp. The integrity index was calculated as the ratio of the two concentrations (201 bp/105 bp). More intact circulating DNA would give a higher integrity index. Results: The plasma DNA integrity index of the NPC patients was significantly higher than that of the healthy controls (median, 0.356 versus 0.238; P < 0.001). After radiotherapy, a reduction in plasma DNA integrity index was observed in 70% NPC patients. Patients with persistent aberrations of plasma DNA integrity had significantly poorer survival probability than those with reduced DNA integrity after treatment (P < 0.001, Kaplan-Meier). Conclusions: NPC is associated with disturbances in the integrity of circulating cell-free DNA. The persistence of DNA integrity aberrations after radiotherapy is associated with reduced probability of disease-free survival. Therefore, the measurement of plasma DNA integrity may serve as a useful marker for the detection and monitoring of malignant diseases. © 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.

51049091006	Quantitative analysis of the transrenal excretion of circulating EBV DNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	Purpose: The existence of transrenal clearance of circulating cell-free DNA is controversial. In this study, we used NPC as a model to investigate if circulating EBV DNA can be excreted into urine and to quantify the contribution of renal excretion to the clearance of plasma EBV DNA. Experimental Design: Quantitative analysis of urine EBV DNA was done for 74 NPC patients using real-time PCR with two different amplicon sizes. The urine concentration of EBV DNA was expressed as copies per millimole of creatinine (copies/mmol Cr) to minimize the effects of interindividual variations in hydration status. Results: EBV DNA was detectable in the urine of 56% NPC patients using a 59-bp real-time PCR assay. The median urine EBV DNA concentrations measured by the 59- and 76-bp assays were 7,040 and 290 copies/mmol Cr, respectively. Patients with detectable urine EBV DNA had significantly higher plasma concentrations, with a positive correlation between the plasma and urine concentrations of EBV DNA. The fraction of plasma EBV DNA excreted into the urine was 0.0026% of that for creatinine. Conclusions: We have shown that circulating EBV DNA can be excreted transrenally into urine in NPC patient and the fraction of excretion is negatively associated with the size of the DNA molecules. Because there is a positive correlation between plasma and urine EBV DNA concentration, urine EBV DNA analysis may potentially be applicable as an ultra-noninvasive test for the monitoring and prognostication of NPC patients. © 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.

53849090287	The prognostic significance of tumor vascular invasion and its association with plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA, tumor volume and metabolic activity in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Parapharyngeal tumor invasion is a known predictor of distant recurrence in stage II-III nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study evaluated the prognostic significance of parapharyngeal and cavernous sinus vascular invasion in stage III-IV NPC, and its association with plasma Epstein-Barr virus (pEBV) DNA, disease stage, tumor volume and metabolic activity. Eligible patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron-emission tomography (PET) and blood sampling for pEBV DNA before undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Relationship between treatment outcome and tumor vascular invasion was analyzed using Cox regression. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between vascular invasion and other cofactors. Fifty seven patients with predominantly T3-T4 or N2-N3 stage disease were enrolled. Parapharyngeal invasion was present in 56% and cavernous sinus invasion in 19% of tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor vascular invasion did not predict treatment outcome, while tumor FDG-uptake was the only significant factor that predicted survival and recurrence. Tumor vascular invasion was associated with T-stage, but not pEBV DNA or tumor volume. Parapharyngeal and cavernous sinus invasion were not significant predictors of distant recurrence following chemoradiotherapy in our cohort with locoregionally advanced NPC. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

62449333560	A patient-reported outcome instrument to assess the impact of oropharyngeal mucositis on health-related quality of life: A longitudinal psychometric evaluation	Goals of work: An oropharyngeal mucositis (OM)-specific health-related quality of life measure (OMQoL) has been developed to assess the impact of OM from the perspective of patients. The current paper describes the convergent, concurrent, and known-group validities and responsiveness in relation to clinical and health outcomes. Materials and methods: A multicenter approach was used, and 137 patients treated with different cancer therapies completed the OMQoL and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30 (Ch)] twice over a 4-week period or weekly over a 7-week period, along with concurrent measures of OM and its related symptoms. Main results: The OM-related symptom scores correlated highly with the OMQoL, confirming its convergent validity (r∈=∈-0.724 - 0.971, p∈<∈0.01). Moderate correlations between the subscales of the OMQoL and EORTC QLQ-C30 (Ch) were indicative of good concurrent validity (r∈=∈0.450-0.724, p∈<∈0.01). The OMQoL was able to distinguish between patients with different severities of OM (p∈<∈0.01) and types of cancer therapy (p∈<∈0.01), providing evidence of good known-group validity. The changes in effects sizes corresponding to changes in OM curves indicate that the OMQoL is responsive to changes in OM status. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the OMQoL has very good psychometric properties and can be used as a health-related quality of life assessment for cancer patients with OM. Much work is still needed in strengthening the psychometric qualities and interpretability of the OMQoL by demonstrating its ability to detect outcome changes over time. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

64049106707	A Broadly Adaptive Array of Dose-Constraint Templates for Planning of Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Advanced T-Stage Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma	Purpose: To develop and validate adaptive dose-constraint templates in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning for advanced T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method and Materials: Dose-volume histograms of clinically approved plans for 20 patients with advanced T-stage NPC were analyzed, and the pattern of distribution in relation to the degree of overlap between targets and organs at risk (OARs) was explored. An adaptive dose constraint template (ADCT) was developed based on the degree of overlap. Another set of 10 patients with advanced T-stage NPC was selected for validation. Results of the manual arm optimization protocol and the ADCT optimization protocol were compared with respect to dose optimization time, conformity indices, multiple-dose end points, tumor control probability, and normal tissue complication probability. Results: For the ADCT protocol, average time required to achieve an acceptable plan was 9 minutes, with one optimization compared with 94 minutes with more than two optimizations of the manual arm protocol. Target coverage was similar between the manual arm and ADCT plans. A more desirable dose distribution in the region of overlap between planning target volume and OARs was achieved in the ADCT plan. Dose end points of OARs were similar between the manual arm and ADCT plans. Conclusions: With the developed ADCT, IMRT treatment planning becomes more efficient and less dependent on the planner's experience on dose optimization. The developed ADCT is applicable to a wide range of advanced T-stage NPC treatment and has the potential to be applied in a broader context to IMRT planning for other cancer sites. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

64249170470	MRI of radiation-induced tumors of the head and neck in post-radiation nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The aim of this study was to document the sites and MRI features of radiation-induced tumors (RITs) in the head and neck following treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The MRI examinations and clinical records of 20 patients with 21 RITs were reviewed retrospectively. RITs developed 3-30 years after radiotherapy and included eleven squamous cell carcinomas, six sarcomas, two neuroendocrine carcinomas, one mucoepidermoid carcinoma and one meningioma. RITs arose in the maxillary region (9), oro/hypopharynx and oral cavity (5), external auditory canal (4), nasopharynx and sphenoid sinus (2) and brain (1). Radiation-induced carcinoma and sarcoma had MRI features that were useful to distinguish them from recurrent NPC. To improve early detection of RITs, the check areas on an MRI of a patient with previous NPC treated by radiation should always include the maxillary region, tongue, and external auditory canal/temporal bone. © European Society of Radiology 2009.

68249132072	The BAHA hearing system for hearing-impaired postirradiated nasopharyngeal cancer patients: A new indication	BACKGROUND: Radiation for patients who have nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) often renders them hearing challenged and facing difficulties from treatment sequelae such as chronic suppurative otitis media and osteoradionecrosis. Conventional hearing aids aggravate otorrhea, and ear moulds traumatize osteoradionecrosis ulcers in the ear canal. The bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) hearing system might represent an excellent hearing solution. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the BAHA benefit and osseointegration results for hearing-impaired postirradiated NPC patients. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal study. SETTING: Tertiary university center. PATIENTS: Eleven hearing-impaired postirradiated NPC patients were studied from October 2002 to October 2006. METHODS: Two-stage BAHA surgeries were performed. Assessments include pure-tone and speech audiometry, implant integrity, periabutment audit, and patient satisfaction analysis during a 24-month period. Radiation dosimetric analysis and bone sampling at the fixture implant sites were studied. RESULTS: No implant fixtures were lost (follow-up, 13-58 mo). Average patient satisfaction scores were 84.4%, with 80% using their BAHA everyday and 90% using their devices for more than 8 hours. Dosimetric analysis of the implant site revealed that all fixtures were outside the irradiated field. There was a reduction in otorrhea rates after BAHA use over the course of the study. CONCLUSION: Successful osseointegration was demonstrated in postirradiated NPC patients. Improved subjective hearing clarity, reduced ear discharge rates, and extended BAHA usage times accounted for high patient satisfaction with the BAHA hearing system. This is the first study to demonstrate long-term osseointegration and hearing benefit in postirradiated NPC patients. We recommend the BAHA hearing system for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media-related hearing problems in NPC patients. © 2009 Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

70350145005	MRI findings in patients with severe trismus following radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The aim of the study was to document MRI findings in masticator structures in patients with trismus developing after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). MRI neck examinations were reviewed in 35 patients with marked trismus, defined as an interincisal gap of 25 mm or less, post-radiotherapy for NPC. Patients with trismus before treatment, infiltration of masticator structures at the time of trismus, or previous surgery involving the masticator structures were excluded. Sixteen patients had no significant abnormality in their masticator structures (46%). Nineteen patients (54%) had abnormalities comprising radiotherapy-induced masticator muscle fibrosis (n = 19), denervation atrophy of the masticator muscles secondary to mandibular nerve damage (n = 1), mandibular ramus signal abnormalities (n = 5), mandibular condyle sclerosis with or without capsular thickening (n = 5), perimasticator fibrosis extending into the masticator space (n = 3) and inflammation secondary to severe sinusitis extending into the masticator space (n = 2). Nine patients (26%) had more than one type of abnormality. Twenty-two patients (63%) had concomitant skull base osteoradionecrosis which extended into the pterygoid bases in 16 patients (45%). The presence of several MRI abnormalities in the masticator structures of patients with trismus after radiotherapy suggests that trismus is multifactorial. This study advances the understanding of mechanisms behind this debilitating side effect of radiotherapy. © European Society of Radiology 2009.

71049134768	Multicenter phase II study of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma - Correlation with excision repair cross-complementing-1 polymorphisms	Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a platinum-sensitive cancer and excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) polymorphisms have been shown to predict survival in several cancers following platinum therapy. Patients and methods: This multicenter study evaluated the activity of oxaliplatin and prolonged infusion of gemcitabine ('GEMOX' regimen) in recurrent NPC. Baseline blood samples were genotyped for the presence of ERCC1-118 gene polymorphisms. Results: Forty-two patients were recruited, of whom most (61%) had metastatic disease. Of the 40 patients evaluated for response, the respective overall response and disease control rates were 56.1% and 90.2%. At a median follow-up of 14.8 months, the respective median overall survival and time to progression were 19.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.8-22 months] and 9 months (95% CI = 7.3-10 months). Grade 3-4 toxic effects were uncommon. The distribution of ERCC1-118 genotypes from 29 patients was C/C (n = 17, 40.5%), C/T (n = 10, 23.8%) and T/T (n = 2, 4.8%). No differences in survival or response rates were found between genotypes. Conclusions: GEMOX is active in the treatment of recurrent NPC. Detection of single-nucleotide gene polymorphisms from genomic DNA in peripheral blood is feasible in NPC and further studies are warranted. © The Author 2009.

0035001823	Detection of an intense resonance at 2.4 ppm in 	Proton MRS and MRI were used to monitor the progression of severe cerebral radiation injuries in 10 patients over a period of 18 months. An unknown resonance (Px) in the 2.37-2.40 ppm region was consistently detected in the affected temporal lobes of four patients. The detection of Px was only confined to spectra with lactate (Lac) and in patients with the highest severity grading of radiation injury. The incidence of Px in Lac-positive spectra was 42.8% (15/35) and in lesions with highest injury grading was 46.8% (15/32). Lesions with Px had significantly higher Lac/creatine (Cr) ratios and more extensive mass effect changes when compared to lesions without Px. The probable identity of Px was examined in the context of anaerobic glycolysis producing pyruvate (2.37 ppm) and the model of metabolic changes in brain abscess formation implicating succinate (2.40 ppm) © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0034518499	Paranasopharyngeal space involvement in nasopharyngeal cancer: Dectection by CT and MRI	Paranasopharyngeal tumour extension (PTE) from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is staged in its own subgroup in the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. Most large clinical trials use computed tomography (CT) to stage PTE, but diagnosis relies on indirect signs of tumour invasion such as asymmetry of the parapharyngeal fat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the advantage of directly revealing PTE because of its ability to depict the complex anatomical structures that form the boundary of the nasopharynx. The aim of this study was to compare CT and MRI in the identification of PTE and to determine whether the imaging modality used influenced staging of the disease. The MRI and CT scans of 78 patients (156 parapharyngeal regions) with NPC were assessed for PTE. On MRI, PTE was considered to be positive when there was tumour invasion through the complex anatomical structures of the nasopharyngeal wall. When using CT, it was considered positive when there was: (1) distortion of the parapharyngeal fat plane; or (2) extension beyond a line drawn from the medial pterygoid plate to the lateral aspect of the carotid artery. CT scanning and MRI were compared. PTE was judged to be present in 28 of 78 (36%) patients by MRI and in 41 of 78 (53%) scanning by CT when using criterion 1 or 2. An analysis of the discordant findings revealed that MRI was positive in three sides of the nasopharynx in early tumour extension through the pharyngobasilar fascia but not identified with CT by using criterion 1 or 2. MRI was negative in 20 and 21 sides of the nasopharynx that were judged to be positive on CT by using criterion 1 and 2 respectively. In these patients MRI revealed that the positive CT scan was caused by a large tumour compressing but not invading the parapharyngeal fat space, a metastatic lateral retropharyngeal node, or a combination of the two. The imaging modality used for staging NPC has an impact on the staging of PTE. CT scanning suggested the presence of PTE more frequently than MRI because of its inability to distinguish the primary tumour from lateral retropharyngeal nodes, and direct tumour invasion of the parapharyngeal region from tumour compression. The imaging modality and criteria used for staging PTE should be taken into consideration when assessing the results of clinical studies.

0034519913	Neck ultrasound in staging squamous oesophageal carcinoma - A high yield technique	Aim: This study evaluates the use of neck ultrasound in staging squamous oesophageal carcinoma. Materials and Methods: A prospective analysis of the clinical, neck ultrasound (US) and thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings in 121 patients with squamous oesophageal carcinoma at presentation was performed. The relationship between malignant neck nodes, mediastinal and abdominal adenopathy, location and size of the primary tumour was analysed. Results: Ten of 121 patients (8%) had clinically palpable neck nodes which were deemed malignant in six (5%) following US and fine-needle aspiration for cytology. Of those 111 patients with no palpable neck nodes, 31 (28%) had malignant nodes shown on US. The more cephalad the location of the primary tumour, the higher the frequency of malignant neck nodes which were found in 80%, 52%, 29% and 9% of cervical, upper thoracic, mid-thoracic and lower thoracic oesophageal tumours, respectively. Eleven (29%) of the 38 patients with malignant neck nodes shown on US had no CT evidence of additional adenopathy in the mediastinum or upper abdomen. Neck US altered TNM staging in 22/121 (18%) patients at presentation. Conclusion: Neck US frequently detects clinically impalpable metastatic nodes leading to altered TNM staging in patients with squamous oesophageal carcinoma. We advocate its routine use when staging squamous oesophageal carcinoma.

76249114625	Laryngopharyngeal sensory deficits and impaired pharyngeal motor function predict aspiration in patients irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Objectives/Hypothesis: To assess the contribution of laryngopharyngeal sensory deficits and impaired pharyngeal motor function to aspiration in patients irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Study Design: A retrospective study at a tertiary referral university teaching hospital. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients who underwent radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma referred to a dysphagia clinic underwent sensory testing of their laryngopharynx and endoscopic evaluation of their swallowing. The sensory threshold of the laryngopharynx was determined, the pharyngeal contraction assessed, and the status of the larynx and hypopharynx documented before and after swallowing. The presence of laryngeal penetration and aspiration was noted. Results: The average time from radiation therapy to assessment was 10.2 years, and the mean duration of swallowing symptoms was 27 months. Laryngopharyngeal sensation was deficient in 89% of patients and the pharyngeal contraction impaired in 93% patients. Laryngeal penetration and aspiration occurred in 87% and 74% of patients, respectively. Aspiration was associated with food residue in the pyriform fossae after swallowing (P < .001) and impaired pharyngeal contraction (P < .001), but not with laryngopharyngeal sensory deficiency. There was no association between a laryngopharyngeal sensory deficit and impaired pharyngeal contraction. Conclusions. Impaired pharyngeal contraction and food bolus clearance from the hypopharynx during swallowing are more important than laryngopharyngeal sensory deficiency in predicting aspiration in patients who underwent radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. © 2009 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

77949652972	Osteoradionecrosis of the upper cervical spine: MR imaging following radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: To document the MRI appearances of radiation-induced abnormalities in the cervical spine following treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Patients with radiation-induced abnormalities in the upper cervical spine were identified from a retrospective analysis of reports from patients undergoing MRI follow-up. Imaging and clinical records of these patients were reviewed. Symmetrical distribution of abnormalities at C1 (anterior arch ± adjacent aspect of the lateral masses) and C2 (dens ± body especially with a characteristic horizontal rim of marrow preservation above the inferior endplate) were considered typical for osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Results: Abnormalities of C1/2 were identified in 9/884 (1%) patients. The MRI distribution of abnormalities was typical for ORN in four and atypical in five patients. Abnormal soft tissue was present in the atlantoaxial joint in eight patients, forming a florid mass in six. This soft tissue was in direct continuity with the posterior nasopharyngeal wall ulceration via the retropharyngeal region. The final clinical diagnosis was ORN in eight, five of whom had clinical factors which suggested infection could have played a contributory role, and osteomyelitis in one patient. All patients had undergone additional radiotherapy treatment comprising of brachytherapy (7), stereotactic radiotherapy (1) or radiotherapy boost (2) and three had undergone nasopharyngectomy. Conclusion: ORN of the upper cervical spine following radiotherapy for NPC is more common than previously suspected and is seen in patients with additional treatment, especially brachytherapy. MRI features are often atypical and a contributory role of infection in the development of some cases of ORN is postulated. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

77950130796	Chemotherapy as an adjunct to radiotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: A previous meta-analysis investigated the role of chemotherapy in head and neck locally advanced carcinoma. This work had not been performed on nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Objectives: The aim of the project was to study the effect of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Search strategy: We searchedMEDLINE (1966 toOctober 2003), EMBASE (1980 to October 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003) and trial registers. Handsearches of meeting abstracts, references in review articles and of the Chinese medical literature were carried out. Experts and pharmaceutical companies were asked to identify trials. Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing chemotherapy plus radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included. Data collection and analysis: The meta-analysis was based on updated individual patient data. The log rank test, stratified by trial, was used for comparisons and the hazard ratios (HR) of death and failure (loco-regional/distant failure or death) were calculated. Main results: Eight trials with 1753 patients were included.One trial with a 2 x 2 design was counted twice in the analysis. The analysis was performed including 11 comparisons based on 1975 patients. Themedian follow up was six years. The pooled hazard ratio of death was 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.95; P = 0.006) corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 6% at five years from chemotherapy (from 56% to 62%). The pooled hazard ratio of tumour failure or death was 0.76 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.86; P < 0.00001) corresponding to an absolute event-free survival benefit of 10% at five years from chemotherapy (from 42% to 52%). A significant interaction was observed between chemotherapy timings and overall survival (P = 0.005), explaining the heterogeneity observed in the treatment effect (P = 0.03) with the highest benefit from concomitant chemotherapy. Authors' conclusions: Chemotherapy led to a small but significant benefit for overall survival and event-free survival. This benefit was essentially observed when chemotherapy was administered concomitantly with radiotherapy. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by JohnWiley & Sons, Ltd.

77957334060	14-3-3σ expression as a prognostic marker in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma	In this study, we investigated the expression of 14-3-3σ tumor suppressor gene in a panel of NPC cell lines, xenografts and primary tumors. Our objective was to determine the correlation between 14-3-3σ expression and clinical outcome in NPC. We detected reduced 14-3-3σ expression in 5/6 NPC tumor lines by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. By immunohistochemical staining, significant downregulation of 14-3-3σ was also found in 26/72 (36.1%) primary tumors of NPC patients, who were treated with curative radiotherapy. Promoter methylation was confirmed in a subset of primary tumors by methylation-specific PCR analysis. Importantly, we demonstrated that 14-3-3σ expression is significantly associated with both overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), but not with the clinical staging of NPC patients. The low 14-3-3σ expression was associated with improved overall (p=0.029) and cancer-specific survival (p=0.042) on univariate analysis. 14-3-3σ expression and staging were also independent variables to all the prognostic factors under multi-variate analysis. In conclusion, low expression of 14-3-3σ appears to be a valuable marker for better survival in patient with NPC. These results provide the evidence that 14-3-3σ expression is a significant prognostic factor for NPC patients.

77956969297	Risk of second primary malignancies following nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is rare in most of the world but common among southeast Asians. Since NPC is usually diagnosed at relatively young ages and most patients now survive, the issue of second primary tumors (SPTs) has become important. Previous studies of SPTs among NPC survivors have given conflicting results. Data on patients with NPC diagnosed between 1996 and 2002 were abstracted from the medical records of two Hong Kong oncology centers. SPT incidence in these patients was compared to that of Hong Kong's general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Eight-four patients were observed to have at least 1 SPT and 92 total additional cancers (SIR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.55-2.37). The excess risk was greater for women and patients under 40 at diagnosis. Significant excesses were found for tongue, lung, nasal and middle ear, and brain cancers. The pattern of sites at which the greatest excess risk occurred is consistent with the hypothesis that much of the excess is due to treatment effects. The greater excess risk among patients diagnosed before 40 points to possible genetic influences. More research is needed to determine the reasons for greater excess risk among women. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

78650033891	Dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated stereotactic radiotherapy with other stereotactic techniques for locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: Locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients can be salvaged by reirradiation with a substantial degree of radiation-related complications. Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is widely used in this regard because of its rapid dose falloff and high geometric precision. The aim of this study was to examine whether the newly developed intensity-modulated stereotactic radiotherapy (IMSRT) has any dosimetric advantages over three other stereotactic techniques, including circular arc (CARC), static conformal beam (SmMLC), and dynamic conformal arc (mARC), in treating locally recurrent NPC. Methods and Materials: Computed tomography images of 32 patients with locally recurrent NPC, previously treated with SRT, were retrieved from the stereotactic planning system for contouring and computing treatment plans. Treatment planning of each patient was performed for the four treatment techniques: CARC, SmMLC, mARC, and IMSRT. The conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) of the planning target volume (PTV) and doses to the organs at risk (OARs) and normal tissue were compared. Results: All four techniques delivered adequate doses to the PTV. IMSRT, SmMLC, and mARC delivered reasonably conformal and homogenous dose to the PTV (CI <1.47, HI <0.53), but not for CARC (p < 0.05). IMSRT presented with the smallest CI (1.37) and HI (0.40). Among the four techniques, IMSRT spared the greatest number of OARs, namely brainstem, temporal lobes, optic chiasm, and optic nerve, and had the smallest normal tissue volume in the low-dose region. Conclusion: Based on the dosimetric comparison, IMSRT was optimal for locally recurrent NPC by delivering a conformal and homogenous dose to the PTV while sparing OARs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

78651367213	A randomized trial on addition of concurrent-adjuvant chemotherapy and/or accelerated fractionation for locally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background and purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic benefits by adding chemotherapy (+C) and/or accelerated-fractionation (AF) for patients with T3-4N0-1M0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Materials and methods: From 1999 to 2004, 189 eligible patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups (CF/CF + C/AF/AF + C). The number of fractions/week was 5 for the CF groups and 6 for the AF groups. Patients in the +C groups were given concurrent cisplatin plus adjuvant cisplatin and fluorouracil. Results: The AF + C group achieved significantly higher failure-free rate (88% at 5-year) than the CF group (63%; p = 0.013), the AF group (56%; p = 0.001) and the CF + C group (65%; p = 0.027). As compared with CF alone, the increase in late toxicity was statistically insignificant (36% vs. 20%; p = 0.25). Deaths due to cancer progression decreased (7% vs. 33%; p = 0.011) but deaths due to incidental causes increased (9% vs. 2%; p = 0.62). Improvement in overall survival reached borderline significance (85% vs. 66%; p = 0.058). Conclusions: Concurrent-adjuvant chemotherapy combined with AF significantly reduced failure and cancer-specific deaths. Although the increase in major late toxicity and incidental deaths were statistically insignificant, a subtle increase in non-cancer deaths narrowed the overall survival gain. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79952116338	Severe oral mucositis associated with cancer therapy: Impact on oral functional status and quality of life	Goals of work This study determined the incidence of severe oral mucositis (OM), patients' self-reported moderate and severe oral symptoms, and change of quality of life (QoL), as well as examined whether OM severity and pain scores predicted the impairment of oral function and QoL. Patients and methods A multicenter approach was used and 137 patients treated with stomatotoxic chemotherapy (45%), high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy with or without concomitant total body irradiation (12%), head and neck irradiation with or without concomitant chemotherapy (44%) completed the OM-specific QoL measure (OMQoL) once or twice weekly over a 4- or 10-week period, along with concurrent measures of OM using WHO Mucositis Grading System and oral symptoms using 10 cm visual analog scale. Main results The incidence of severe OM was 50% (n=68). About 77-80% of patients with severe OM reported moderate or severe mouth or throat pain, and 66-78% reported moderate or severe oral functional problems. The oral symptoms peak and area-under-thecurve (AUC) scores of patients with severe OM (peak 5.6 to 6.8; AUC 3.8 to 5.2) were significantly higher than those without OM and those with mild OM (p<0.01). The OMQoL subscales peak and AUC scores of patients with severe OM (peak 47.9 to 62.1; AUC -40.1 to -25.8) were significantly lower than those without OM and those with mild OM (p<0.01). Of those with severe OM, 88-94% had a drop in the OMQoL subscale scores to at least 10 points from the baseline. Pain resulting from OM, in particular throat pain, is most predictive of oral functional impairment (standardized β=0.53-0.83). Conclusions Severe OM can cause profound pain and oral functional incapability and clinical significant impairment of QoL. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

0035498777	Incidence of carotid stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after radiotherapy	BACKGROUND. Radiation-induced carotid stenosis in patients with head and neck tumors can cause significant mortality and morbidity. This study examined the incidence of stenosis in the extracranial carotid arteries of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after radiotherapy. METHODS. The extracranial carotid arteries of 71 (53 male and 18 female; mean age of 53.6 years) postradiation patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were examined with color Doppler ultrasound. The distribution of the arterial stenosis and the degree of stenosis were documented. The results were compared with the control group, which comprised 51 newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (35 male and 16 female, mean age of 48.8 years) before radiotherapy. Incidences of risk factors for arterial stenosis such as hypertension, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia also were studied in these two groups. RESULTS. There was no significant difference in the incidence of risk factors between the two groups. Arterial stenosis was, however, more common in the postradiation group than the preradiation group (56 of 71 vs. 11 of 51). The common/internal carotid arteries (CCA/ICA) were most commonly involved (55 of 71 vs. 11 of 51; P < 0.01), followed by the external carotid artery (ECA) (32 of 71 vs. 1 of 51; P < 0.01) and vertebral artery (VA; 5 of 71 vs. 0; P = 0.069). Significant stenosis (> 50% reduction of luminal diameter) was only found in the postradiation group (21 of 71 in CCA/ICA, 11 of 71 in ECA, 4 of 71 in VA). CONCLUSIONS. This study showed that radiation could cause significant carotid stenosis. Ultrasound examinations for these patients therefore are necessary for early detection and possible intervention of this late radiation-induced complication. © 2001 American Cancer Society.

0036112543	Influence of staging thoracic computed tomography on radiation therapy planning for esophageal carcinoma	Radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy is frequently used as definitive treatment for esophageal carcinoma. Although thoracic computed tomography (CT) is widely used in staging esophageal carcinoma, its application to radiation therapy planning has been regarded as optional rather than mandatory. Conventional radiation therapy planning is esophagogram-based rather than CT-based. The treatment port is generated by adding 5 cm to the proximal and distal margins of the tumor-involved segment as seen on esophagogram performed in the treatment position. Historically, a maximum port length of 15 cm was recommended to avoid excessive treatment morbidity. The authors examined the limitations of such a planning protocol by projecting conventional treatment ports onto the thoracic CT of 75 consecutive newly diagnosed cases of nondisseminated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The authors assessed the adequacy of coverage of the primary tumor and metastatic nodes, with respect to data from thoracic CT and neck ultrasonography. It was found that up to 38% of T2-T3 tumors and 30% of short-length (≤5 cm) tumors had metastatic nodes outside the port. The addition of neck ultrasonography led to identification of an additional 5% of patients with nonpalpable nodes outside the port. It is concluded that the frequency of inadequate tumor coverage using an esophagogram-based planning protocol, with a maximum port length of 15 cm, is unacceptably high. Thoracic CT should be a mandatory rather than optional imaging investigation in guiding radiation therapy planning for esophageal cancer.

0036200582	Sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis	Background and Purpose: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Methods: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit. Results: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/ 71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group. Conclusions: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

0036337945	The clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in squamous esophageal cancer: A prospective nonrandomized study of pulse and continuous-infusion regimens with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil	Background: We evaluated cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil as preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced squamous esophageal cancer and compared two different infusion regimens. The outcomes were also compared with those of our historical control patients treated by surgery alone. Methods: From 1991 to 1997, 83 consecutive esophageal cancer patients underwent surgical exploration after completion of two cycles of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy regimens, either in pulse or in continuous infusion cycles. Outcomes were compared with those of 76 historical control patients. Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics and tumor stages. The resection rates, operative morbidity, mortality, and survival rates were compared. Results: Partial response was achieved in 50% of patients who received chemotherapy. There was no chemotherapy-related mortality. The resection, morbidity, and mortality rates and median survival between the surgery-alone group and the chemotherapy group were 71.1% vs. 82%, 51% vs. 55%, and 4% vs. 10.8%, 12.0 vs. 13.5 months, respectively (P > .05). There was also no statistically significant difference between the two regimens. Conclusions: Preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil infusion, in pulse or continuous regimens, followed by surgery for squamous esophageal cancer patients had no added benefit in the overall survival.

0036342357	Differential expression of the suppressor PML and Ki-67 identifies three subtypes of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene, which encodes a transformation and growth suppressor, was found to regulate transcription and apoptosis. PML was first identified at the chromosomal translocation break-points t(15;17) of acute promyelocytic leukaemia and the gene product may mediate cell-cycle control and apoptosis. PML was found to interact with the co-transactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) and the apoptotic-modulator Bax. To determine if PML, CBP and Bax may be involved in solid tumours, such as the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a rare neoplasia that is prevalent in Southern China, the expression of these proteins and the proliferation marker Ki-67 was analysed by immunohistochemical staining. Expression of PML in the PML-oncogenic domain (POD) or nuclear bodies in most NPC was inversely correlated with the expression of Ki-67. In addition, based on PML expression patterns in NPC three subtypes could be identified, namely, Subtype-1, with strong PML expression in POD structures and with low Ki-67 staining; Subtype-2, where PML was expressed in a homogeneously diffused pattern, but with a low intensity in the tumour cells; while Ki-67 was expressed in a moderate number of cells and Subtype-3, where the majority of tumour cells were PML-negative, while a considerable number of tumour cells were strongly labelled with Ki-67. Furthermore, CBP was present in most of the NPC cells with moderate-strong nuclear staining, while the expression in non-tumour cells were relatively weak. However, there was no direct correlation between PML and CBP expression in the NPC examined. In addition, there was low or no expression of Bax in the NP and NPC. This is, to our knowledge, the first report describing PML and CBP expression in NPC and our data strongly suggests that PML and CBP, but not Bax, may play a role in the transformed phenotypes of NPC. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

0036347726	In vivo diagnosis of persistent and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma by contact endoscopy	Objective: To evaluate the potential use of contact endoscopy for the diagnosis of persistent and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma in postirradiated patients. Study Design: Prospective study to examine 64 consecutive patients who have been irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a clinic setting using contact rhinoscopes (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany [7215 AA, 0°, and 7215 BA, 30°; 23 cm long. 4 mm in diameter]). Methods: The superficial cells of the posterior walls of the nasopharynx were stained with 1% methylene blue and examined with contact rhinoscopes with the patient under local anesthesia at high magnifications (x60 and x150). Biopsy of the areas under examination was performed. The contact endoscopic images were analyzed and correlated with the corresponding histological sections of the biopsy tissues. Results: Contact endoscopy was performed in 64 patients (54 men; mean age, 42 y) with the use of local anesthesia. Four patterns of contact endoscopic findings were identified: squamous metaplasia (43 cases), postirradiation atypia (10), granulation tissue (6), and malignancy (5). In the last group, the nasopharynx appeared normal in two patients (40%). The findings of contact endoscopy correlated well with the histological findings (kappa reliability coefficient = 0.847; P <.001; diagnostic accuracy, 92.1%). For prediction of persistent and recurrent disease, the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic findings were both 100%. Conclusion: Contact endoscopy is an accurate, reliable office-based procedure that allows for in vivo and in situ diagnosis of persistent and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma in postirradiated patients.

0036570252	Factors affecting risk of symptomatic temporal lobe necrosis: Significance of fractional dose and treatment time	Purpose: To study the factors affecting the risk of symptomatic temporal lobe necrosis after different fractionation schedules. Methods and Materials: One thousand thirty-two patients with T1-2 nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radical radiotherapy in Hong Kong during 1990-1995 were studied. They were treated at four different centers with similar techniques but different fractionation schedules: 984 patients were given 1 fraction daily throughout (q.d.), and 48 patients were irradiated twice daily (b.i.d.) for part of the course. The median total dose was 62.5 Gy (range 50.4-71.2), dose per fraction was 2.5 Gy (range 1.6-4.2), and overall treatment time (OTT) was 44 days (range 29-70). In addition, 500 patients received supplementary doses for parapharyngeal extension, 113 received booster doses by brachytherapy, and 114 received sequential chemotherapy using cisplatin-based regimes. Results: Altogether, 24 patients developed symptomatic temporal lobe necrosis: 18 from the q.d. group and 6 from the b.i.d. group. The 5-year actuarial incidence ranged from 0% (after 66 Gy in 33 fractions within 44 days) to 14% (after 71.2 Gy in 40 fractions within 35 days). Multivariate analyses showed that the risk was significantly affected by the fractional effect of the product of total dose and dose per fraction (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.05), OTT (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97), and b.i.d. scheduling (HR 13, 95% CI 3-54). Repeating the analyses for patients treated with the q.d. schedules confirmed the independent significance of OTT in addition to the product of total dose and dose per fraction. Conclusion: The tentative results suggest that in addition to fractional dose, the OTT also had significant impact on the risk of temporal lobe necrosis, and b.i.d. scheduling increased the hazard further. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

0036665044	Carotid Intima-media thickness in patients with head and neck irradiation for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Aim: Intima-media thickness (IMT) has been shown to be useful in the evaluation and monitoring of carotid artery atherosclerosis in patients at risk of cardiovascular events. In this study, we aimed to examine the IMT in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who received irradiation to the carotid arteries during radiotherapy, and compared them with a control group. Materials and methods: Fifty-one NPC patients (aged between 39 and 69 years) and a group of 51 age-and sex-matched controls were studied by ultrasound. The IMT at the far wall of the common carotid artery was measured three times and the average value taken in each subject. The IMT of both groups were compared. Risk factors for IMT thickness, including hypertension, smoking, hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, history of cerebrovascular accidents and cardiovascular disease, were also studied. Results: The mean carotid IMT of patients in the NPC group (2.2+/-1.5 mm) was statistically greater than that in normal controls (0.7+/-0.15 mm) (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the IMT in the right and left common carotid arteries within each group of patients. Conclusion: The findings suggest that patients with irradiation have increased arterial IMT. As they are asymptomatic the clinical relevance is not clear. © 2002 The Royal College of Radiologists.

0036682445	Quantitative measurement of post-irradiation neck fibrosis based on the young modulus: Description of a new method and clinical results	BACKGROUND. Postirradiation fibrosis is one of the most common late effects of radiation therapy for patients with head and neck carcinoma. An objective and quantitative method for its measurement is much desired, but the criteria currently used to score fibrosis are mostly semiquantitative and partially subjective. METHODS. The Young Modulus (YM) is a physical parameter that characterizes the deformability of material to stress. The authors measured the YM in soft tissues of the neck, at defined reference points, using an ultrasound probe and computer algorithm that quantified the indentation (deformation) on tissue due to a measured, applied force. One hundred five patients who had received previous radiation therapy to the entire neck were assessed, and the results were compared with the hand palpation scores and with a functional parameter represented by the range of neck rotation, and all results were correlated with symptoms. RESULTS. The YM was obtained successfully in all patients examined. It had a significant positive correlation with the palpation score and a significant negative correlation with the range of neck rotation. The YM was significantly higher on the side of the neck that received a boost dose of radiation, although the corresponding palpation scores were similar. The results of all three measurement methods were correlated with symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Postirradiation neck fibrosis can be measured in absolute units based on the YM. The results showed a significant correlation with hand palpation scores, with restriction of neck rotation, and with symptoms. Compared with the palpation method, the YM is more quantitative, objective, focused on small subregions, and better discriminates regions subject to differential radiation dose levels. Its inclusion in the Analytic category of the Late Effects of Normal Tissues-SOMA system should be considered to facilitate comparative studies. © 2002 American Cancer Society.

79959976478	Use of Rasch analysis in the evaluation of the oropharyngeal mucositis quality of life scale	Background: Oropharyngeal mucositis (OM) is a significant clinical problem causing profound impairment of health-related quality of life (HQoL) for patients undergoing cancer therapy. The Oropharyngeal Mucositis-Specific Health-Related Quality of Life Measure (OMQoL) was developed using classical test theory to measure the self-perceived HQoL of patients with mucositis. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the OMQoL according to the Rasch model and, on the basis of results, determine whether improvements could be made. METHOD: A multicenter approach was used, and 210 patients treated with stomatotoxic chemotherapy (36%), high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy ± total body irradiation (10%), or head and neck irradiation ± chemotherapy (54%) completed the OMQoL. The Partial Credit Model of Rasch analysis was applied to evaluate the 31-item OMQoL using WINSTEPS and R software. Unidimensionality (measurement of a single construct), item fit, response category performance, person separation reliability, targeting of item difficulty to person ability, and differential item functioning (DIF) were examined. Results: Of 31 items, 5 were removed due to misfit; the OMQoL was reduced to 26 items with acceptable information weighted fit/outlier-sensitive fit indices (within 0.7-1.3) and eigenvalue units (≤2.0), confirming the unidimensionality of the reduced OMQoL. The OMQoL and its four subscales showed ordered category thresholds, and the person separation reliability was high (person separation index >0.2 with reliability >.8). Nevertheless, some of the items in the OMQoL might not be targeted effectively to patients with low levels of OM. Significant uniform and nonuniform DIFs were not found for gender (uniform DIF, p = .26; nonuniform DIF, p= .24) and age (uniform DIF, p = .95; nonuniform DIF, p = .65). Discussion: Rasch analysis reveals that the reduced 26-item OMQoL is unidimensional and is adequate to measure HQoL for patients with OM regardless of gender and age group. This improved version can provide a common platform for nurses to use in their assessment, caring, and treatment of patients with OM. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84857216515	False-positive 131I uptake in fixed prosthetic denture	Iodine-131 whole-body scan is used to detect functional metastases in patients with history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Nonphysiological uptakes are usually interpreted as thyroid metastases. However, false-positive uptakes, such as nonthyroidal tumors and contamination from body secretions, have been reported. We report a case of incidental finding of tracer activity in a patient's prosthetic denture, which was localized by SPECT/CT. There is no evidence of dental or periodontal disease clinically or radiologically, and the serum thyroglobulin was at undetectable level. Potential false-positive activity related to dental conditions should be recognized and not be mistaken as metastatic disease. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

0037032506	Plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA and residual disease after radiotherapy for undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA can be detected and quantified in the plasma of patients with EBV-related tumors, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Although NPC at early stages can be cured by radical radiotherapy, there is a high recurrence rate in patients with advanced NPC. The pretreatment level of circulating EBV DNA is a prognostic factor for NPC, but the prognostic value of post-treatment EBV DNA has not been studied. We designed a prospective study in Hong Kong, China, to investigate the value of plasma EBV DNA as a prognostic factor for NPC. Methods: One hundred seventy NPC patients, without metastatic disease at presentation, were treated with a uniform radiotherapy protocol. Circulating EBV DNA was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction before treatment and 6-8 weeks after radiotherapy was completed. Risk ratios (RRs) were determined with a Cox regression model, and associations of various factors with progression-free and overall survival and recurrence rates were determined with a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Ninety-nine percent of patients achieved complete clinical remission. Levels of post-treatment EBV DNA dominated the effect of levels of pretreatment EBV DNA for progression-free survival. The RR for NPC recurrence was 11.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.53 to 25.43) for patients with higher post-treatment EBV DNA and 2.5 (95% CI = 1.14 to 5.70) for patients with higher pretreatment EBV DNA. Higher levels of post-treatment EBV DNA were statistically significantly associated with overall survival (P<.001; RR for NPC recurrence = 8.6, 95% CI = 3.69 to 19.97). The positive and negative predictive values for NPC recurrence for a higher level of post-treatment EBV DNA were 87% (95% CI = 58% to 98%) and 83% (95% CI = 76% to 89%), respectively. Conclusion: Levels of post-treatment plasma EBV DNA in patients with NPC appear to strongly predict progression-free and overall survival and to accurately reflect the post-treatment residual tumor load.

0037412849	Progress of memory function after radiation therapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The authors evaluated the late neurocognitive profile and progress of memory functions in 60 patients with primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma who had been treated with radiation therapy for more than 2 years. Forty had imaging evidence of temporal lobe injury (TLI-positive), and 20 did not (TLI-negative). The patients and 19 healthy control subjects, matched with the patients for age and educational level, underwent extensive memory assessments. Seventeen patients (10 TLI-positive, 7 TLI-negative) were reassessed after an average of 28 months for progress of memory functions. The patient groups performed significantly worse on most memory tests compared with the normal subjects. Patients with memory complaints had lower scores for verbal memory than those without such complaints. The TLI-positive and TLI-negative groups did not differ significantly from each other in cognitive performance. At follow-up, visual memory performance had deteriorated, while verbal memory remained more stable.

0037438777	Molecular cytogenetic characterization of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and xenografts by comparative genomic hybridization and spectral karyotyping	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines and xenografts represent valuable models for functional and therapeutic studies on this common malignancy in Southeast Asia. The karyotypic information in most NPC cell lines and xenografts, however, remains largely unclear to date. We have characterized the chromosomal aberrations in six commonly used human NPC cell lines and xenografts using the molecular cytogenetic technique of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Genomic imbalances identified in cell lines were further correlated with structural abnormalities indicated from spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis. CGH revealed consistent overrepresentations of 8q (six out of six cases) with a smallest overlapping region identified on 8q21.1∼q22. Other common gains included 7p (4/6 cases), 7q (4/6 cases), 12q (4/6), and 20q (4/6 cases), where minimal overlapping regions were suggested on 7p15∼p14, 7q11.2∼q21, and 12q22∼q24.1. Common losses were detected on 3p12∼p21 (4/6 cases) and 11q14∼qter (4/6 cases). Although SKY analysis on cell lines revealed predominantly unbalanced rearrangements, reciprocal translocations that involved chromosome 2 [i.e., t(1;2), t(2;3), and t(2;4)] were suggested. Furthermore, SKY examination illustrated additional breakpoints on a number of apparently balanced chromosomes. These breakpoints included 3p21, 3q26, 5q31, 6p21.1∼p25, 7p14∼p22, and 8q22. Our finding of regional gains and losses and breakpoints represents information that may contribute to NPC studies in vitro. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

0037669569	Pretherapy quantitative measurement of circulating Epstein - Barr virus DNA is predictive of posttherapy distant failure in patients with early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma of undifferentiated type	BACKGROUND. Patients with International Union Against Cancer (UICC) Stage I-II nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) appear to have a relatively favorable prognosis and generally are excluded from trials of combined modality treatment. More recently, plasma/serum cell-free Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been shown to be measurable in the majority of NPC patients at the time of diagnosis, and appears to have prognostic significance. However, within Stage I-II disease, in which failure events are infrequent, the prognostic impact of the pretreatment EBV DNA level has not been addressed to our knowledge. This issue has management implications because different therapeutic strategies currently are employed for patients with good-risk and those with poor-risk NPC. METHODS. A cohort of 90 patients with UICC Stage I-II NPC (World Health Organization Grade 2/3 histology) had their pretherapy plasma/serum EBV DNA levels determined by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay and correlated with the probability of posttherapy failure. All patients received radiation therapy only, except for three patients who also received concurrent chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier plots of the probability of locoregional failure, distant failure, and cancer-specific survival were compared with reference to clinical stage and EBV DNA levels. RESULTS. With a median follow-up time of 45 months, 12 patients and 7 patients, respectively, had developed locoregional and distant failures, including 2 patients with both local and distant failures. Patients with distant failure had significantly higher pretherapy EBV DNA levels than those without failure (a median of 13,219 copies/mL [interquatile-range, 274,635 copies/mL] vs. a median of 423 copies/mL [interquatile-range, 2753 copies/mL]). The probability of distant failure was significantly higher in patients with high (> 4000 copies/mL plasma) compared with low EBV DNA levels (P = 0.0001, log-rank test) and for Stage IIB disease compared with Stage I and Stage IIA disease combined (P = 0.0149, log-rank test), but was not significantly different between patients with Stage II and those with Stage I disease. The risks of locoregional failure were not significantly different between patients with high and those with low EBV DNA levels, and also was not significantly different between clinical substages. Approximately 35% of patients with Stage IIB disease were in the at-risk group for distant failure, as identified by high EBV DNA levels. CONCLUSIONS. Within a group of patients with UICC Stage I-II NPC, the pretherapy plasma EBV DNA level was found to identify a poor-risk group with a probability of distant failure similar to that of patients with advanced stage disease. This group of patients may warrant management considerations currently applicable only to cases of Stage III-IV disease. The prognostic significance of designating Stage IIB disease as per the 1997 UICC staging was confirmed, although the pretherapy EBV DNA level appears to be a more powerful prognostic discriminator in patients with early-stage NPC. © 2003 American Cancer Society.

0037729004	Molecular characterization of circulating EBV DNA in the plasma of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lymphoma patients	Despite the increasing clinical applications of circulating EBV DNA analysis as a tumor marker, the molecular nature of these EBV DNA molecules remains unclear. We subjected plasma/serum samples of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lymphoma patients to DNase digestion and ultracentrifugation and showed that circulating EBV DNA molecules are "naked" DNA fragments instead of being contained inside virions. We further showed that these EBV DNA fragments were relatively short, and 87% of them were shorter than 181 bp. These results provide fundamental information that may improve our understanding of the release of tumor-derived nucleic acids into the blood of cancer patients.

84872720661	The incremental value of single-photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography in post-thyroidectomy iodine-131 scanning of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Part I: Retrospective analysis of 26 cases	Objective: This study investigated whether single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with integrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) may have additional value over whole-body scintigraphy in determining the presence and location of tumour uptake in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Methods: Between 1 January and 31 December 2011, planar imaging was performed on 79 patients after total or nearly total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Of these patients, 26 also underwent SPECT/CT (using an integrated system) because the planar findings were inconclusive. Fusion images were considered to have incremental value over planar images when they better localised sites of increased iodine-131 uptake. The final diagnosis was supplemented by other imaging modalities, serological correlation, and clinical follow-up. The impact of SPECT/CT results on therapeutic strategy was assessed. Results: SPECT/CT had an incremental value over planar imaging in all of the 26 patients who underwent fusion imaging, by exclusion of distant metastases (42%), differentiation of pathological versus physiological uptake (38%), more accurate localisation of equivocal uptake (50%), discrimination between normal remnants and lymph node metastases in the neck (12%), and identification of occult lesions in the skeleton unsuspected on planar imaging (12%). SPECT/CT led to modified therapeutic management in nine (35%) of the 26 patients studied. Conclusion: The use of SPECT/CT fusion imaging offered incremental value over whole-body scintigraphy in increasing diagnostic accuracy, improving the interpretation of equivocal uptake, and modifying therapeutic strategies. © 2012 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.

Examples are given to illustrate how SPECT/CT fusion images can enhance anatomical localisation of increased uptake identified on planar images, and thus enable differentiation of physiological uptake and artefacts from metastatic uptake, exclude false-positive findings, and confirm true-positive findings and, hence, affect the clinical decision on further therapeutic treatment in this group of patients. © 2012 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.

84872972023	Angiographic features, collaterals, and infarct topography of symptomatic occlusive radiation vasculopathy: A case-referent study	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes. METHODS - : We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern. RESULTS - : ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS - : ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation. Clinical decompensation, despite more extensive collateralization, may precipitate stroke in ORV. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84877578956	Early detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA analysis in a surveillance program	BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Over the last decade, plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been developed as a tumor marker for NPC. In this study, the authors investigated whether plasma EBV DNA analysis is useful for NPC surveillance. METHODS: In total, 1318 volunteers ages 40 to 60 years were prospectively recruited. Plasma EBV DNA and serology for viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin A (IgA) were measured. Participants who had detectable plasma EBV DNA or positive IgA serology underwent nasal endoscopic examination and a follow-up plasma EBV DNA analysis in approximately 2 weeks. All participants were followed for 2 years to record the development of NPC. RESULTS: Three individuals with NPC were identified at enrolment. All of them were positive for EBV DNA and remained positive in follow-up analysis. Only 1 of those patients was positive for EBV serology. In 1 patient who had NPC with a small tumor confined to the mucosa, the tumor was not detectable on endoscopic examination. Because of a 2-fold increase in plasma EBV DNA on the follow-up analysis, that patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed the tumor. Among the participants who did not have NPC but had initially positive plasma EBV DNA results, approximately 66% had negative EBV DNA results after a median of 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma EBV DNA analysis proved useful for detecting early NPC in individuals without a clinical suspicion of NPC. Repeating the test in those who had initially positive results differentiated those with NPC from those who had false-positive results. Cancer 2013. © 2013 American Cancer Society.

0042334787	Disparity of sensitivities in detection of radiation-naïve and postirradiation recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma of the undifferentiated type by quantitative analysis of circulating Epstein-Barr virus DNA	Purpose: The purpose of this research was to compare the sensitivities of plasma EBV DNA in detection of postirradiation locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), postirradiation distant metastatic NPC, and radiation-naïve NPC. Experimental Design: Twenty-four patients with postirradiation local recurrence of NPC were assessed for plasma EBV DNA levels by a real-time quantitative PCR system. The results were compared with those of a cohort of 140 patients with newly diagnosed NPC and with those of 25 patients with distant metastatic relapse. EBV-encoded RNA positivity was also assessed in locally recurrent tumors and newly diagnosed tumors with undetectable plasma EBV DNA levels. Results: Postirradiation locally recurrent tumors were associated with a significantly lower rate of detectable plasma EBV DNA compared with radiation-naïve tumors of comparable stage [stage I-II tumors: 5 of 12 (42%) versus 47 of 51 (92%), P = 0.0002; stage III-IV tumors: 10 of 12 (83%) versus 88 of 89 (99%), P = 0.01; Fisher's exact test], and compared with distant metastatic recurrences [15 of 24 (63%) versus 24 of 25 (96%), P < 0.02; Fisher's exact test]. The median EBV DNA level in patients with detectable EBV DNA was also significantly lower in locally recurrent tumors than in radiation-naïve tumors. All of the tissue samples of tumors associated with undetectable EBV DNA levels, where available, were EBV-encoded RNA positive. Conclusions: The sensitivity of EBV DNA in the detection of tumors regrowing from an irradiated site is much lower than that from a radiation-naïve site. Although plasma EBV DNA is very effective in detecting distant metastatic relapse of NPC, it cannot be relied on as the sole surveillance tool for detection of local relapse.

0042334866	Rapid clearance of plasma epstein-barr virus DNA after surgical treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: Circulating EBV DNA analysis has been shown to be valuable in the detection, prognostication, and monitoring of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. A previous study has shown that, after radiotherapy, plasma EBV DNA levels of NPC patients would decline exponentially with a median half-life of 3.8 days. We postulate that this decline in plasma EBV DNA reflects the decrease in cancer cell population and, therefore, the rate of decline reflects the radiosensitivity of the tumor. However, this postulation would hold true only if EBV DNA is rapidly eliminated from the circulation. In this study, we determined the in vivo elimination rate of plasma EBV DNA in NPC patients. Experimental Design: We monitored the level of plasma EBV DNA in NPC patients during and after surgical resection of NPC. The half-life of plasma EBV DNA was then calculated by plotting the natural logarithm of EBV DNA concentrations against time. Results: The median half-life of plasma EBV DNA after surgical resection of NPC was 139 min. After a median follow-up of 6.7 days, EBV DNA was undetectable in 8 of 11 patients. One of 8 patients with undectable EBV DNA and all of the patients with detectable EBV DNA developed clinical relapse. Conclusions: The in vivo elimination of EBV DNA is very rapid after surgical resection of NPC. The failure of complete and rapid elimination of EBV DNA from the circulation predicts disease recurrence.

To show whether there is any association between the development of neurologic symptoms and the total cerebral blood flow volume documented by color velocity imaging in patients with carotid stenosis that develops after radiotherapy. Methods. Twenty-three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (4 female and 19 male; age range, 39-69 years; mean age, 55.6 years) and major extracranial carotid stenosis underwent color velocity imaging. In this group, 8 patients had symptoms of a stroke or transient ischemic attack, and the other 15 patients were asymptomatic. The color velocity imaging results in the symptomatic group were then compared with those in the asymptomatic group. Results. The cerebral blood flow in the symptomatic group was significantly lower than that in the asymptomatic group (224.1 ± 89.0 versus 532.5 ± 89.0 mL/min; P = .001). Condusions. Cerebral blood flow as measured by color velocity imaging was lower in the symptomatic group. There is an association between the development of neurologic symptoms and blood flow volume.

0344199823	Two distinct regions of deletion on chromosome 13q in primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is rare in most parts of the world, but prevalent in Southern China. Although this disease poses a serious health problem in our population, the genetic alterations that lead to the development of NPC have yet to be defined. In a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) study on NPC by our group, loss of the long arm of chromosome 13 has been identified as a frequent event. To investigate further the involvement of this genetic alteration in NPC tumorigenesis, we examined 31 primary NPC tumours by LOH analysis with a panel of 13 microsatellite polymorphic markers distributed along the long arm of chromosome 13. It was found that 19/31 tumours (60%) showed LOH for markers on chromosome 13q. The highest frequency of LOH was found at loci D13S133 (53.6%) on 13q14.3 and D13S796 (38.5%) on 13q32-34. Two distinct smallest deletion regions were delineated- the first region between D13S133 and D13S119 at 13q14.3-22, and the second region between D13S317 and D13S285 at 13q31-34. Our findings show that LOH of 13q is a common event in NPC and that at least 2 putative tumour- suppressor loci may be present on 13q. Mapping of the critical regions of these loci suggests that some candidate tumour-suppressor genes on 13q, other than Rb and BRCA2, may be involved in the development of NPC.

0343920688	Intracavitary brachytherapy significantly enhances local control of early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma: The existence of a dose-tumor-control relationship above conventional tumoricidal dose	Purpose: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and Materials: All T1 and T2 (nasal infiltration) NPC treated with a curative intent from 1984 to 1996 were analyzed (n = 509). One hundred sixty-three patients were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT) (Group A). They were compared with 346 patients treated by ERT alone (Group B). The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10 ≥75 Gy) to the primary tumor and did not differ between the two groups in technique or dosage. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in 3 fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources. ICT was used to treat local persistence diagnosed at 4-6 weeks after ERT (n = 101) or as an adjuvant for the complete responders to ERT (n = 62). Results: The two groups did not differ in patients' age or sex, rate of distant metastasis, rate of regional failure, overall survival, or the follow-up duration. However, Group A had significantly more T2 lesions and Group B had significantly more advanced N- stages. Local failure was significantly less (crude rates 6.75% vs. 13.0%; 5- year actuarial rates 5.40% vs. 10.3%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates 14.1% vs. 21.7%; 5-year actuarial rates 11.9% vs. 16.4%) in Group A compared to Group B. Multivariate analysis showed that the ICT was the only significant prognostic factor predictive for fewer local failures (Cox regression p = 0.0328, risk ratio = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.256-0.957). However, when ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumor repopulation during the period of radiotherapy became significant in predicting ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the incidence rates of each individual chronic radiation complication and the actuarial cumulative rate of the chronic radiation complications, with the exception of chronic radiation nasopharyngeal ulceration/necrosis which occurred in 10 patients in Group A and 1 patient in Group B. Headache (n = 4) and foul smell (n = 8) consequential to ulceration/necrosis were mild and manageable by conservative means. A significant dose-tumor-control relationship existed when local failure was studied as a function of the total physical dose or the total biological equivalent dose (linear quadratic equation, α/β = 10) uncorrected for tumor repopulation during the time course of the radiotherapy. Conclusions: Supplementing ERT which delivered tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10 ≥75 Gy), ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control and avoided the necessity for morbid salvage treatments in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. The slight increase in chronic radiation ulceration/necrosis after ICT was acceptable with mild and manageable symptoms. Other late complications were not increased. A significant dose-tumor-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

84903515220	Plasma Epstein-Barr viral DNA load at midpoint of radiotherapy course predicts outcome in advanced-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: To test the hypothesis that prognostication of treatment outcome is feasible by biomarker response at midcourse of chemoradiotherapy (CRT)/radiotherapy (RT), with respect to the plasma load of Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and methods: One hundred seven patients with stage IIB-IV NPC were prospectively studied. Plasma EBV DNA load was measured by quantitative PCR before therapy (pre-DNA), at completion of 4 weeks of CRT/RT (mid-DNA), and within 3 months of completion of therapy (post-DNA). The end points are post-DNA load, a recognized surrogate of survival, and clinical outcome. Results: Ninety-three percent of patients had detectable EBV DNA before therapy (median load = 972 copies/ml). EBV DNA became undetectable in 55 (51%) patients at the end of week 4 of therapy. Detectable mid-DNA was associated with worse clinical outcome (median follow-up time, 6.2 years), for distant failure [hazard ratio (HR) 12.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.78-51.93; P < 0.0001], progression-free survival (PFS; HR 4.05, 95% CI 1.89-8.67, P < 0.0001), and overall survival (OS; HR 3.29, 95% CI 1.37-7.90, P = 0.0077). Seventy-four percent of all failures were associated with detectable mid-DNA, whereas 34% of all failures were associated with detectable post-DNA. Stratification by tumor stage (IIB, III, IV) has no significant prognostic effect. Conclusions: Unfavorable EBV DNA response at midcourse of RT/CRT is an adverse prognosticator for treatment outcome, is linked to majority of all failures, and discriminates outcome better than tumor stage. The data could provide a basis for trial design that addresses alteration of therapy intensity during the latter phase of CRT, and adjuvant therapy. Validation studies are awaited. © The Author 2014.

Immunohistochemical staining for BrdU and Ki 67 was also performed. Results: The median S-phase duration (Ts) was 6.2 h (range 3.5-18.7 h), median flow cytometric labeling index (FCM-LI) was 7.4% (1.3-37.6%), and median potential doubling time (Tpot) was 3.6 days (0.5-19.9 days). The median histologic labeling index (H-LI) was 12.4% (1.2-43.3%), and median histologic Tpot (H-Tpot) was 2.1 days (0.5-33.3 days). FCM-LI and H-LI were both positively correlated with Ki67 whereas Tpot and H-Tpot were both negatively correlated with Ki67 and N-stage. In univariate analysis, Tpot and H-Tpot showed a trend for progression free survival. Tpot was significantly associated with local relapse free survival, but lost its significance in multivariate analysis. N-stage was the only significant prognostic factor for all radiotherapy outcomes in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Tpot was the only pre-treatment cell kinetic parameter for which some evidence was found for an association with survival in NPC patients. Future studies should aim to combine cell kinetic parameters together with other biological markers and clinical parameters to provide more useful prognostic information to guide individual patient's therapy. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

0742287012	Improved Accuracy of Detection of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma by Combined Application of Circulating Epstein-Barr Virus DNA and Anti-Epstein-Barr Viral Capsid Antigen IgA Antibody	Background: Circulating Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA and anti-EBV capsid antigen IgA (IgA VCA) represent two of the most sensitive peripheral blood markers of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but direct comparative studies of these two markers are lacking. Methods: The sensitivities and specificities of IgA-VCA and EBV DNA for diagnosis of NPC were determined in 139 new cases of NPC and 178 healthy individuals, respectively. EBV DNA was also assessed in 36 healthy family members identified as having false-positive IgA-VCA results at a screening clinic. EBV DNA was measured by a real-time quantitative PCR assay with a detection limit of 60 copies/mL. IgA-VCA was measured by semiquantitative indirect immunofluorescent method; a titer ≥1/10 was taken as positive. Results: The sensitivities of EBV DNA and IgA-VCA for diagnosis of NPC were 95% (95% confidence interval, 91-98%) and 81% (73-87%), respectively. The combined marker panel had an overall sensitivity (positive result by either marker) of 99%. The concentrations of both markers showed dependence on cancer stage. The specificities of EBV DNA and IgA-VCA were 98% (96-99%) and 96% (91-98%), respectively. Among 36 healthy family members with false-positive IgA-VCA results, three-fourths had undetectable EBV DNA, whereas the others had increased EBV DNA concentrations that were significantly lower than in NPC patients. Conclusions: For diagnosis of NPC, EBV DNA identifies almost all false-negative IgA-VCA cases and gives a 99% diagnostic sensitivity when combined with IgA-VCA. In the screening setting, EBV DNA identifies three-fourths of false-positive IgA-VCA cases. The selective application of EBV DNA in an IgA-VCA-based screening protocol could improve screening accuracy with only moderate increases in cost. © 2004 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

10044257645	Treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: The Hong Kong experience	Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the primary treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), including the role of dose escalation above 66 Gy level. Methods and materials Between July 2000 and September 2002, 63 newly diagnosed NPC patients were treated with IMRT. The disease was Stage I in 9 (14%), Stage II in 18 (29%), Stage III in 22 (35%), and Stage IV in 14 (22%). The prescribed dose was 66 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and positive neck nodes, 60 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV), and 54-60 Gy to the clinically negative neck. All 20 (100%) patients with T1-2a tumors received intracavitary brachytherapy (ICB) boost, and 15/42 (36%) patients with T2b-T4 tumors received conformal boost (8 Gy/4 fractions). Nineteen patients with advanced stage disease also received either neoadjuvant or concurrent chemotherapy. Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Local relapse-free survival (LRFS), nodal relapse-free survival (NRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results With a median follow-up of 29 months (range 8-45 months), 4 patients developed local in-field failure, 1 patient developed regional relapse, and 13 patients developed distant metastases. All 4 patients with local failure had either T3 or T4 disease before primary treatment and did not have ICB or conformal boost. The 3-year actuarial LRFS, NRFS, DMFS, and OS were 92%, 98%, 79%, and 90%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation above 66 Gy was significantly associated with better PFS and DMFS, whereas GTV size was a significant adverse factor for OS. The worst acute mucositis was Grade 1 or 2 in 36 (59%), and Grade 3 in 25 (41%) patients. Acute dysphagia requiring tube feeding occurred in 5 (8%) patients. The proportion of patients with Grade 2-3 xerostomia was 57% at 3 months, and 23% at 2 years after IMRT. Within the subset of patients with a mean parotid dose of <31 Gy, the proportions with Grade 2-3 xerostomia were 30% and 17% at 3 months and 2 years, respectively. Conclusion Our experience of using IMRT in the primary treatment of NPC showed a very high rate of locoregional control and favorable toxicity profile. Furthermore, we found that dose escalation above 66 Gy of IMRT-based therapy was a significant determinant of progression-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival for advanced T-stage tumors. Distant metastases represent the predominant mode of treatment failure. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

11144353064	Quasi-linear viscoelastic properties of fibrotic neck tissues obtained from ultrasound indentation tests in vivo	Background. Hand palpation is a conventional way to assess and document soft tissue fibrosis. But it is semi-quantitative and subjective, so there is a need to develop quantitative and objective methods for this purpose. Methods. 105 patients with different degrees of radiation-induced fibrosis of soft tissue of the neck were assessed using an ultrasound indentation method. The force response was reconstructed from the indentation history using a quasi-linear viscoelastic model with four material parameters. The parameters which best curve-fitted the force response with respect to the experimentally measured one, were selected as the viscoelastic properties of the tested soft tissue. These parameters were compared among patient subgroups with different degrees of fibrosis as scored by hand palpation, and also compared with those of a control group of healthy, non-irradiated subjects. Their relation to the rotation range of the neck and the effective Young's modulus, were also assessed. Findings. Soft tissue with a more severe degree of fibrosis was associated with a larger initial stiffness and a more rapid increase in stiffness under loading. Viscoelasticity parameters could discriminate soft tissue with different degrees of clinical fibrosis and had significant correlation with clinical parameters of fibrosis. Interpretation. Change of viscoelastic properties is reflection of pathological modifications of components in fibrotic soft tissues. Measurement of viscoelasticity parameters of soft tissue provides a quantitative and objective approach for the researcher and clinician to quantify soft tissue fibrosis. Relevance Measurement of the change of viscoelastic properties of soft tissue provides a quantitative and objective approach for researchers and clinicians to quantify soft tissue fibrosis which is one of the most common late effects of radiotherapy. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

12844278926	Segmentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) lesions in MR images	An accurate and reproducible method to delineate tumor margins from uninvolved tissues is of vital importance in guiding radiation therapy (RT). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), tumor margin may be difficult to identify in magnetic resonance (MR) images, making the task of optimizing RT treatment more difficult. Our aim in this study is to develop a semiautomatic image segmentation method for NPC that requires minimal human intervention and is capable of delineating tumor margins with good accuracy and reproducibility. The segmentation algorithm includes 5 stages: masking, Bayesian probability calculation, smoothing, thresholding and seed growing, and finally dilation and overlaying of results with different thresholds. The algorithm is based on information obtained from the contrast enhancement ratio of T1-weighted images and signal intensity of T2-weighted images. The algorithm is initiated by the selection of a valid anatomical seed point within the tumor by the user. The algorithm was evaluated on MR images from 7 NPC patients and was compared against the radiologist's reference outline. The algorithm was successfully implemented on all 7 subjects. With a threshold of 1, the average percent match is 78.5 ± 3.86 (standard deviation) %, and the correspondence ratio is 66.5 ± 7%. The segmentation algorithm presented here may be useful for diagnosing NPC and may guide RT treatment planning. Further improvement will be desirable to improve the accuracy and versatility of the method. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

12944273548	An analysis of the incidence and risk factors of developing severe keratopathy in eyes after megavoltage external beam irradiation	Objective: To investigate the incidence and risk factors of developing severe keratopathy in eyes exposed to megavoltage external beam irradiation. Design: Retrospective noncomparative case series. Participants: The authors evaluated 88 eyes of 88 consecutive patients who had received irradiation of an entire orbit during radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Mean follow-up was 40 months (range, 24-106 months). Intervention: Slit-lamp biomicroscopic findings of the cornea after irradiation were categorized into four grades in accordance with a standard protocol. Grade 3 or above changes were defined as severe radiation keratopathy. Main Outcome Measures: The incidence of severe radiation keratopathy was evaluated along with patient's age, radiation dose, lacrimal shielding, and tumor involvement of the trigeminal nerve. Results: Severe radiation keratopathy developed in 32 patients. Mean latency was 15 months (range, 4-36 months). Its incidence increased from 0% after doses less than 59 Gy to 100% after doses greater than 70 Gy. Between 59 Gy and 69 Gy, the adverse factor was omission of lacrimal shield during radiation therapy (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Radiation dose to the cornea is the most important factor in determining the outcome of radiation keratopathy. When the threshold dose is reached, visual prognosis is grave despite protection of the lacrimal gland. Clinical trials on newer strategies to treat ocular surfaces exposed to heavy irradiation are necessary.

12144290957	Quantitative Analysis of Cell-Free Epstein-Barr Virus DNA in Plasma of Patients with Nonnasopharyngeal Head and Neck Carcinomas	Purpose: We investigated the detectability of EBV DNA in the plasma of patients with non-nasopharyngeal head and neck carcinomas (NNHNC). Previous studies have shown that EBV is present in the tumor tissue of some NNHNC. Experimental Design: We recruited 101 patients with NNHNC and 48 healthy controls. Blood samples were taken from controls and patients before treatment. Tumor tissue samples were tested for the presence of EBV in the first 69 patients by in situ hybridization for small EBV-encoded RNA (EBER). Plasma EBV DNA was measured by real-time quantitative PCR in patients and controls. Results: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the commonest histology (78 patients) followed by lymphoepithelial carcinoma (8 patients). EBER was detected in tumor cells in 7 of 69 patients tested. All of the EBER-positive tumors were lymphoepithelial carcinoma. Two controls (2 of 48; 4.2%) had detectable plasma EBV DNA. Plasma EBV DNA was detected in all of the patients with EBER-positive tumors, and in 23 of 94 (24.5%) patients with tumors of EBER-negative or unknown status. The proportion of plasma EBV DNA-positive cases in either group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.0027). Plasma EBV DNA concentrations in patients with EBER-positive tumors (median, 3827 copies/ml) were significantly higher than those in the controls (median, 0 copy/ml; P = 0.0001). Of patients with SCC, 21 (26.9%) had detectable plasma EBV DNA (median concentration, 34 copies/ml). Plasma EBV DNA concentrations in the whole group of patients with SCC (median, 0 copy/ml; interquartile range, 0-4 copies/ ml) were also significantly higher than those in the controls (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data indicate that plasma EBV DNA reflects tumoral EBER status, and it may be of use as a tumor marker for EBER-positive NNHNC. The biological and clinical significance of low levels of circulating EBV DNA in the minority of patients with EBER-negative tumors remain to be elucidated.
