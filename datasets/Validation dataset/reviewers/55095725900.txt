33645912079	Theoretical studies on SARS coronavirus 3CL proteinase and its inhibitor	As a positive stranded RNA virus, SARS virus's spread and replication are mainly determined by its inner six kinds of protein, including E protein, S protein, M protein, N protein, RNA polyprotein and proteinase. In the six ones, proteinase is closely related to the replication of the SARS virus, and so it is the best and the most important starting point when choosing medicine to kill virus. We docked ligand with receptor by means of Autodock program and simulated the molecular dynamic properties at SGI O3800 Operating Station through utilizing the Discover 3 modules of Insight II and analyzed the contour of proteinase pockets. Additionally, we discussed interaction of subunits, hydrogen bonds, electronstatic and some hydrophobic effects, which provide an important reference for further studying the designing of medicine.

33646337909	Binding mode of insulin receptor and agonist peptide	Insulin is a protein hormone secreted by pancreatic β cells. One of its main functions is to keep the balance of glucose inside the body by regulating the absorption and metabolism of glucose in the periphery tissue, as well as the production and storage of hepatic glycogen. The insulin receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein in which two a sub-units with a molecular weight of 135 kD and two β subunits with a molecular weight of 95 kD are joined by a disulfide bond to form a β-α-α-β structure. The extracellular α subunit, especially, its three domains near the N-terminal are partially responsible for signal transduction or ligand-binding, as indicated by the experiments. The extracellular a subunits are involved in binding the ligands. The experimental results indicate that the three domains of the N-terminal of the a subunits are the main determinative parts of the insulin receptor to bind the insulin or mimetic peptide. We employed the extracellular domain(PDBID: 1IGR) of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor(IGF-1R) as the template to simulate and optimize the spatial structures of the three domains in the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor, which includes 468 residues. The work was accomplished by making use of the homology program in the Insight II package on an Origin3800 server. The docking calculations of the insulin receptor obtained by homology with hexapeptides were carried out by means of the program Affinity. The analysis indicated that there were hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic and hydrophobic effects in the docking complex of the insulin receptor with hexapeptides. Moreover, we described the spatial orientation of a mimetic peptide with agonist activity in the docking complex. We obtained a rough model of binding of DLAPSQ or STIVYS with the insulin receptor, which provides the powerful theoretical support for designing the minimal insulin mimetic peptide with agonist activity, making it possible to develop oral small molecular hypoglycemic drugs.

40949144417	Identification and chemical enhancement of two ornamental plants for phytoremediation	With an increase in the contamination of urban areas, more and more attention has been paid to the role of ornamental plants in remedying contaminated soils. Thus, cadmium (Cd) tolerance and accumulation characteristics of Calendula officinalis and Althaea rosea as ornamental plants under the concentration gradient experiment with single Cd, as well as the effect of ethylenegluatarotriacetic acid (EGTA) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on their Cd phytoremediation capacity under the chemically enhanced experiment was further investigated. It was showed that they had strong tolerance and accumulation capacity of Cd under single Cd treatments, thus they had great potential to be used for Cd contaminated soil remediation. Furthermore, under chemically enhanced treatments, the great efficiency was found through applying EGTA and SDS, they could not only increase the dry biomass of the plants, but also promote the Cd accumulation in shoots and roots. Particularly, Althaea rosea can be regarded as a potential Cd-hyperaccumulator through applying chemical agents. In conclusion, the two ornamental plants are promising to be used for phytoremediation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77954306955	Evaluation of chemical enhancement on phytoremediation effect of CD-contaminated soils with Calendula Officinalis L	The popular ornamental plant Calendula officinalis L. was studied for its potential application in the phytoremediation of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soils. Enhancements to the Cd accumulation by the application of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylenegluatarotriacetic acid (EGTA) to the soil were investigated. Under these chemically enhanced treatments, EDTA was observed to be toxic to the plants leading to retarded growth. However, the application of SDS and/or EGTA was shown to result in significantly increased plant biomass (p < 0.05). Most of the chemical treatments resulted in increases to the shoot and root Cd concentrations, with the root Cd concentration being consistently higher than that shoot Cd concentration. Almost all of the investigated chemical treatments containing SDS or and EGTA were shown to lead to an increase in the total Cd content in the plants (p < 0.05). The application of EGTA alone led to an observed total Cd increase of up to 217%. This investigation revealed considerable efficiency of chemical enhancement and correspondingly increased potential of Calendula officinalis L. for applications of phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated sites. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

79951594257	Computer modelling study on the compatibility of PEO-PMMA block copolymers	The compatibility of six kinds of designed poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PEO-b-PMMA) copolymers was studied at 270, 298 and 400K by mesoscopic modelling. The values of order parameter depended on both the structures of block copolymers and the simulation temperatures, while the values of order parameter of the long chains were higher than those of the short ones; temperature showed a more obvious effect on long chains than on short ones. These plain copolymers doped with PEO or PMMA homopolymer showed different order parameter values. When the triblock copolymer was composed of the same component at both ends and was doped with a homopolymer with the same component as that in the middle or the end of triblock copolymer, the values of order parameter depended on the simulation temperature, such as A5B6A5 doped with B6 at 400K and A5B6A5 doped with A5 at 270K, it showed the highest order parameter values. The study of copolymers doped with nanoparticles showed that the mesoscopic phase was influenced by not only the properties of the nanoparticles, such as the size and density, but also the compositions of copolymers. Among them, increasing the size of doped nanoparticles was the most significant effect on changing the phase morphologies. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

80052333540	Computational investigation on the ethylene-induced: Esterase from Citrus sinensis	In order to understand the interaction between ethylene-induced esterase(EIE, EC 3.1.1.) from Citrus sinensis and α-naphthyl acetate, a 3D model of EIE was generated based on the crystal structure of the tobacco salicylic acid binding protein 2(SABP2). With the aid of the molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics methods, the final refined model was obtained and its reliability was further assessed. In this study, the docking results show that the main-chain amide of residue His85 and residue Val18 can form hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen group of α-naphthyl acetate. MM-PBSA method was applied to calculating the binding free energy between EIE mutants and α-naphthyl acetate. Our calculated binding free energy of each of the two mutant complexes is increased compared with that of the one of the wild type, which is unfavorable to the reaction. It is well consistent with the experimental data. The above results clearly indicate that His85 and Val18 in EIE function as the oxyanion role and take part in the catalytic reaction. The new structural insights obtained from this computational study are expected to stimulate further biochemical studies on the structures and mechanisms of EIE and other members of the plant α/β hydrolases.

80052973057	Stochastic evaluation of voltage in distribution networks considering the characteristic of distributed generators	As the probabilistic load flow (PLF) approach is often applied in the assessment the voltage in the distribution system with the distributed generation, the intermittent power output of the distributed generators (DGs) should be more considered. The power variation characteristics of load and distributed generators should be treated separately. In this paper, taking the PV arrays for the typical example, the probability density function (PDF) of the DG is derived from the mathematical model of the power source and the PDF of its uncertain variables. The stochastic voltage evaluation via the PLF is processed by the 2 point estimate method (2 PEM). Besides, the possible network configurations with the relative probability are also considered, for analyzing the comprehensive case for the occurrence of network change. The proposed method will be tested with the modified IEEE 13-nodel feeder test system, and the data for the probabilistic evaluating features of all the nodal voltages distribution are obtained. The results can be used to help know the general and complete voltage effects. © 2011 IEEE.

80052973424	Research on VSC-HVDC system to mitigate power output fluctuation caused by wind farms	With global environment problems increasing, wind power as a renewable energy is concerned worldwide, many wind farms are designed recently, however, the power output of wind farms is fluctuant which is determined by the intermittent and random of wind speed. With the increase of wind farm capacity and the percentage of wind power in the whole power system, the influence of the power output fluctuation of wind farms for the system stability will be more remarkable.

The free energies are consistent with available experimental results and suggest that the binding site of BSA-drug1 is more stable than those of BSA-drug2 and BSA-drug3. The energy decomposition analysis is performed and reveals that the electrostatic interactions play an important role in the stabilization of the binding site of BSA-drug1 while the van der Waals interactions contribute largely to stabilization of the binding site of BSA-drug2 and BSA-drug3. The key residues stabilizing the binding sites of BSA-drug1, BSA-drug2 and BSA-drug3 are identified based on the residue decomposition analysis. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84876678805	Rational and efficient preparation of a chimeric protein containing a tandem dimer of thrombopoietin mimetic peptide fused to human growth hormone in Escherichia coli	The 14-mer thrombopoietin mimetic peptide (TMP), especially in the form of dimer, displayed potent megakaryocytopoiesis activity in vitro. However, it is difficult to prepare such short peptide with high bioactivity through gene-engineering approaches. In this study, a chimeric protein containing a tandem dimer of TMP (dTMP) fused to human growth hormone (hGH), a kind of hematopoietic growth factor that activates the same signal pathways as thrombopoietin, was produced in Escherichia coli by soluble expression. By rational utilization of the XmnI and EcoRV restriction sites, a PCR fragment encoding dTMP-GH was inserted into the plasmid vector pMAL-p2X at the position right after Xa factor cleavage site, in frame with maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene. Under optimized conditions, a high-level expression of soluble MBP-dTMP-GH fusion protein was obtained. By application of amylose resin chromatography, Xa factor digestion, hydrophobic chromatography followed by gel filtration, the dTMP-GH fusion protein was separated. Finally, a relatively high yield of dTMP-GH fusion protein with high purity (>98 %) and without redundant amino acid was achieved, as identified by high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and amino acid sequencing. The functional assays showed that dTMP-GH could promote the proliferation of megakaryoblast cells and maturation of murine megakaryocytes derived from bone marrow, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, an enhanced effect of dTMP-GH on megakaryocytopoiesis was found as compared with equimolar concentration of dTMP and rhGH. This work provides a new avenue to generate thrombopoietic agents based on TMP. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

54449084374	Protective effects of rhizoma paridis total saponins on septic rats	Objective: To investigate the protective effect of rhizoma paridis total saponins and its mechanism on septic rats. Methods: Septic model was reproduced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in Wistar rats. Rhizoma paridis total saponins was administered to observe its protective effects on septic rats. Blood was collected to determine serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels at 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after operation by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The pathological changes of lung tissue were observed with light microscope at 72 hours after operation. The peritoneal macrophages (PMΦ) in rats were isolated and the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in PMΦ after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 μg/L) were measured by ELISA. Results: Mortality in the rhizoma paridis total saponins group was significantly lower than the CLP group (50.0% vs. 85.0%, P<0.05). The levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in serum were significantly lower than those of the CLP group at the same time (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The degree of inflammatory injury to the lung was much milder than that in the CLP group. In the in vitro experiment, it was shown that rhizoma paridis total saponins in concentrations of 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/L could inhibit remarkably the release of TNF-α and IL-1β from LPS-stimulated PMΦ of rats (all P<0.01). The differences in TNF-α levels among the groups showed no statistically significant difference (all P>0.05). The level of IL-1β in 5 mg/L group was significantly higher than that of the 10 mg/L group (P<0.05), but showed no difference with those of 20 mg/L and 40 mg/L groups (both P>0.05). Conclusion: Rhizoma paridis total saponins can protect the CLP rats by inhibiting the activation of rat PMΦ to release cytokines and ameliorating acute lung injury.

58549120593	Cadmium tolerance and accumulation of Althaea rosea Cav. and its potential as a hyperaccumulator under chemical enhancement	The role of ornamental plants has drawn much attention as the urban pollution levels exacerbate. Althaea rosea Cav. had showed its strong tolerance and accumulation ability of Cd in our previous work, thus, the effects of ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDTA), ethylenegluatarotriacetic acid (EGTA) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on its Cd phytoremediation capacity were further investigated in this work. It reconfirmed that the species had strong tolerance and accumulation ability of Cd. Particularly, the species can be regarded as a potential Cd-hyperaccumulator through applying chemical agents. However, different chelators and surfactants had great differences in affecting hyperaccumulating characteristics of the species. EGTA and SDS could not only increase the dry biomass of the plants, but also promote Cd accumulation in shoots and roots. On the contrary, EDTA was toxic to the species by restraining the growth of plants, although it could promote Cd accumulation in shoots and roots of the plants to a certain extent. Thus, EGTA and SDS were effective in enhancing phytoremediation with Althaea rosea Cav. for Cd contaminated soils, while EDTA is ineffective in this regard. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

Researchers are mainly focus on the design of controllers and the control methods of VSC-HVDC but the research of the control system framework of VSC-HVDC system is nearly neglected. This paper firstly introduces the structure of VSC-HVDC system. Then it clarifies the basic control functions of the control system of VSC-HVDC and points out that the redundancy configuration and the multi-layer structural design are necessary. A four-layer structure of the control system framework of VSC-HVDC is proposed concretely, which is made up with the DC system control layer, converters control layer, separate control layer and valves control layer. Based on the principles of configuration of each layer, the paper describes the control functions and scope of each control layer at details. In view of the close correlation between the control system and the protection of VSC-HVDC system, the paper further discusses the coordination issues between them.

Methods: A total of 200 patients with lower limb fracture receiving the surgery were randomly divided into 4 groups. In Groups A, B and C, patients received 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion under general anesthesia, and ketamine in a dose of 0.1 mg/ kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.01 mg/kg per hour continuously for 24 hours after surgery, respectively. The control group (Group D) received an equivalent volume of normal saline only. With 20 μg/ml remifentanil in normal saline, postoperative PCA was administered with a background infusion at 2 ml/h following 2 ml as a loading dose and 1ml demand dose with a 3-minute lockout period. Remifentanil consumption, 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) scores, global satisfaction score (GSS), and side effects were also recorded by the acute pain service. Results: Cumulative PCA remifentanil consumption in Groups A and B were (1378±377) μg and (1531±402) μg, significantly lower than (1807±510) μg and (1838±523) μg in Groups C and D (P<0.01). VAS scores in Groups A and B were significantly lower than those in Groups C and D (P<0.01). In the first 12 hours after operation, GSS was improved (P<0.01). No respiratory depression was observed. No significant difference in side effects was observed among groups. Conclusion: Low-dose ketamine can relieve postoperative pain and moderately decrease remifentanil consumption for PCA, with no obvious side effects of ketamine.

Holo-NCS has gained much attention in clinical use as well as for drug delivery systems, but the chromophore-releasing mechanism to trigger binding to the target DNA with high affinity and producing DNA damage remain unclear. Three possible pathways were initially determined by conventional MD, essential dynamics and essential dynamics sampling. One of the paths runs along the naphthoate moiety; another runs along the amino sugar moiety; the third along the enediyne ring. Further, calculated forces and time by FPMD (force-probe molecular dynamics) suggest that the opening of the naphthoate moiety is most favorable pathway and Leu45, Phe76 and Phe78 all are key residues for chromophore release. In addition, conformational analyses indicate that the chromophore release is only local motions for the protein. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Compared with vibration, ultrasonic irradiation significantly enhanced the activity of Novozym 435. The reaction rate was further increased under the condition of ultrasonic irradiation with vibration (UIV). Effects of reaction conditions, such as ultrasonic power, water content, organic solvents, ratio of solvent/oil, ratio of methanol/oil, enzyme dosage and temperature on the activity of Novozym 435 were investigated under UIV. Under the optimum conditions (50% of ultrasonic power, 50 rpm vibration, water content of 0.5%, tert-amyl alcohol/oil volume ratio of 1:1, methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, 6% Novozym 435 and 40 °C), 96% yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) could be achieved in 4 h. Furthermore, repeated use of Novozym 435 after five cycles showed no obvious loss in enzyme activity, which suggested this enzyme was stable under the UIV condition. These results indicated that UIV was a fast and efficient method for biodiesel production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE: To review studies related the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1) and exercise induced skeletal muscle adaptations. METHODS: A computer-based online search of Pubmed was performed for relevant English articles published from January 1995 to January 2009 with the keywords of "PGC1, skeletal muscle, exercise, adaptations". The relevant articles about PGC-1 and exercise induced skeletal muscle adaptations were included, and repetitive contents were excluded. PGC1 and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and exercise-induced skeletal muscle adaptation and PGC1s changed served as the evaluation indicators. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of 57 collected articles, 34 were classified and sorted according to the criteria. Endurance training results in profound adaptations for skeletal muscle, including mitochondrial biogenesis, capillary density, and fiber composition. Transcription factors are highly dependent on coactivator molecules to regulate training physiologic adaptation processes. The majority of transcription factors target genes are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. These transcriptional patterns may provide a basic framework for understanding the integration of mitochondrial biogenesis and function with signaling events that exercise induced energetic properties. Post-transcription of PGC-1 alpha protein, there are a variety of protein modifications, with a variety of biological processes closely related to the possible adaptive mechanism of exercise-induced skeletal muscle.

78649540276	Research on soft regulation strategy of VSC-HVDC systems	Based on power electronic converting current devices which can be controlled quickly, VSC-HVDC system can regulate active power, reactive power, DC voltage, and line voltage flexibly. Different regulation strategies have different influences on the power system stability. A worse regulation strategiy may lead to sharp fluctuation of electrical measurements and longer regulation time, which is harmful for the system stability. It is worse when faults happen during the regulation. The traditional regulation strategy is that the reference value of regulation is set to the goal value directly, sometimes the change is very serious like the reversal of power flow, and the electrical measurements may have sharp fluctuation during the regulation. Different from the traditional regulation strategy, a new regulation strategy, called soft regulation strategy, was presented in the paper, which can minish the fluctuation of electrical measurements and shorten the regulation time. The soft regulation strategy is helpful for the system stability and the device security. The soft protection strategy for serious impact from AC faults is also presented, by which the fault terminal is softly closed and the non-fault terminal works right as before, while the DC voltage can be kept, which increases the efficiency of VSC-HVDC system and makes preparation for restoration. Simulations performed in PSCAD/EMTDC verify the proposed regulation strategy. ©2010 IEEE.

78649967764	A methodology for power quality evaluation in distribution network with distributed generation	The issue of power quality in the distribution system is always in sense of the concern. With the high penetration of distributed generation (DG) currently, it tends to be more complicated. This paper presents a new approach to evaluate impacts of the DG on power quality of the distribution network. In the process an objective function will be modeled, which will be solved by the optimization toolbox, in order to calculate the result for the evaluating grade. Furthermore, the results of the overall evaluation will be given via the eigenvalue weighted method. The power quality ranking of each feeder with the distributed generators in the distribution network will be apparent with the given weight of influence caused by DGs divided in forms of energy resource. © 2010 IEEE.

78650944789	Fabrication of Fe-based amorphous composite coating by electrothermal explosion spraying on aluminum substrate	In order to improve the surface properties of the aluminum alloy, an amorphous composite coating was prepared on the surface of the aluminum alloy substrate by electrothermal explosion spraying with fully amorphous Fe-Si-B ribbons. The microstructure, phase structure and micro-hardness of the coating were characterized by SEM, XRD and Vickers hardness tester. The results show that the composite coating is composed of amorphous phase and nanocrystal phase. The coating has dense structure and low porosity. It has not been seen rough laminar microstructure that is frequently obtained by other thermal spray techniques. The amorphous composite coatings with different thickness present higher hardness and show good mechanical properties. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications Switzerland.

78751525324	Research on interconnecting offshore wind farms based on multi-terminal VSC-HVDC	The paper describes the use of multi-terminal HVDC transmission system based on voltage source converter (VSC) (VSC-MTDC) for connecting doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms over long distance. The operation principles between DFIG and VSC-MTDC of the proposed system are described. Stator flux oriented vector control technology is used to execute AC excitation for DFIG rotor, then independent control of active and reactive power is realized and electricity generation by capturing maximal wind energy is also obtained. The control objective of rectifiers is delivering the generated power from the wind farms to the DC network instantaneously and to keep AC voltage at wind farm bus constant. The control objective of inverters is receiving the power from the DC network and to keep DC voltage constant, and the multi VSCs are controlled coordinately, the relevant mathematical model was established. The parameters optimization based on simplex algorithm and objective function are used to get suitable PI control parameters of VSC-MTDC. Interactions between DFIG and VSC-MTDC link are investigated and simulations performed in PSCAD/EMTDC to verity the proposed control strategy. ©2010 IEEE.

78751558564	High temperature creep behavior of in-situ TiC/Ni composites	A 70 wt% TiC particulate reinforced Ni matrix composite was in-situ synthesized using self-propagating high-temperature synthesis and combined with pseudo heat isostatic pressing technique. The nearly spherical TiC particle reinforcements were uniformly distributed in the Ni matrix and most of the carbide grains were of 3-4 μm in diameter. Creep behavior of the TiC/Ni composites had been investigated in ambient atmosphere under constant load tensile tests. The stress exponent values of 7.69 and 6.62 were obtained at 923 K and 1023 K, respectively. The creep fracture should be initiated by a mixture of particle cracking, interface debonding and void nucleating, while interface debonding was dominant fracture at high temperature. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

79960096113	Modeling and analysis of the compatibility of poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(methyl methacrylate) blends with surface and shear inducing effects	The compatibility of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends was studied over a wide range of compositions at 400 K by mesoscopic modeling. Sixteen patterned surfaces of four types were designed and designated as "ci," "co," "gra," and "rg" to study their influence on changing the microscopic phase morphology. The topography of the "ci" series surfaces was shaped by semicircular balls. Different radii were applied to simulate different degrees of surface roughness. The "co" series were composed of cubic columns as the mask, and the cubic columns were separated by equal spaces. Various sizes and heights of columns were used to simulate different degrees of surface roughness. The "gra" series were composed of surfaces with different areas of section and the same height to simulate different degrees of surface roughness. The "rg" series were composed of concentric cuboids with continuous increasing heights and sizes. The "co" series surfaces were the most efficient distribution in changing the microscopic phase morphology, the "gra" and "rg" series surfaces were both the secondary, and the "ci" series surfaces placed the last. The results show that the effect of inducing surfaces depended on both the pattern of surfaces and the compositions of the blends. The shear effect was effective in changing the phase morphology, but its influencing effect depended on not only the shear rate, but also the compositions of the blends, especially when the blends were rich in PEO. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79960981064	Molecular simulation study on the enediyne ring chromophore releasing mechanism from the holo-NCS protein	The enediyne ring chromophore with strong DNA cleavage activity of neocarzinostatin is labile and therefore must be stabilized by forming the complex (binding protein+chromophore: holo-NCS). Though holo-NCS has gained much attention in clinical use as well as for drug delivery systems, the chromophore-releasing mechanism to trigger binding to the target DNA with high affinity and producing DNA damage remains unclear. In this work, the complex of neocarzinostatin and binding protein corresponding to the complex have been studied, and the mechanism of the chromophore-releasing from binding protein is studied with molecular simulation and steered molecular dynamics, too. Further, calculated forces and time by FPMD (force-probe molecular dynamics) suggest that the opening of the naphthoate moiety should be the most favorable pathway.

80052038473	Evaluation of the anti-neuraminidase activity of the traditional Chinese medicines and determination of the anti-influenza A virus effects of the neuraminidase inhibitory TCMs in vitro and in vivo	Etnopharmacological relevance: Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are currently the most effective drugs to treat influenza A viruses infection. Many traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been used in the clinics to treat influenza. The anti-viral mechanisms of these TCMs and their inhibitory effects towards NA need to be systematically tested. Aim of the study: To evaluate the anti-NA activity of the TCMs and the anti-influenza A virus effects of the NA inhibitory TCMs in vitro and in vivo. Material and methods: We tested the inhibitory activity of water extracts from 439 TCMs towards NA. The in vitro anti-influenza virus activities of the 5 TCMs were evaluated using the strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) NYMC X-179A of influenza A virus. A randomly selected TCM with NA inhibitory activity, Melia toosendan extract, was further evaluated using a mouse model infected with influenza A virus. Results: Five TCMs, Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke [Fragaria indica Andr.], Liquidambar formosana Hance., Lithospermum erythrorhizon Sieb. et Zucc., Melia toosendan Sieb. et Zucc., and Prunella vulgaris L., exerted potent inhibitory activity towards NA. These TCMs in the range of 25-250 μg/mL had the ability to reduce virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and the virus yield in MDCK cells. Melia toosendan significantly reduced death rate and prolonged mean day to death (MDD) of the viral infected mice. Conclusions: This study describes five TCMs exerted strong inhibitory activities towards NA, and exhibited antiviral effect against influenza A virus by reducing viral reproduction and reduced CPE of the viral infected cells. Melia toosendan, significantly reduced death rate and prolonged survival of the H1N1 viral infected mice. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

Microstructure and phase composition of the composite were characterized by SEM and XRD. Creep behavior of the composite had been investigated under constant tensile stress, and the creep damage of the creep specimen was characterized by elastic modulus. The results show that the composite consists of nearly spherical TiC particle and Ni, the addition of Molybdenum has effect on refining the size of TiC particle; the mechanism of creep fracture is inter-granular fracture; relative variable curve of modulus resemble to creep curve, the method of elastic modulus is well to characterize the creep damage. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

Eighteen patterned surfaces of four series were designed and designated as "ci," "co," "gra," and "rg" to study their influence on changing the microscopic phase morphology of copolymers. The topography of the "ci" series surfaces was shaped by semicircular balls. Different radii were applied to simulate different degrees of surface roughness. The "co" series were composed of cubic columns as the mask, and the cubic columns were separated by equal spaces. Various sizes and heights of columns were used to simulate different degrees of surface roughness. The "gra" series were composed of surfaces with different areas of section and the same height to simulate different degrees of surface roughness. The "rg" series were composed of concentric cuboids with continuous increasing heights and sizes. The degree of phase separation depended on the structures of copolymers, the topography of surfaces and the simulation temperatures. When the triblock copolymer with surfaces induced was composed of the same component at both ends and had larger PS segment percentage, it would present higher values of order parameter, that was, "ABA" showed the highest, "AB" the second high and "BAB" the last, the values of order parameter of the long chains were higher than those of the short ones, except the situation with co-4432 and co-8832 surfaces induced. However, the co-4432 and co-8832 surfaces performed the most intensive extent of inducing effect. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2012.

84855668055	Effects of nanoparticles on the compatibility of PEO-PMMA block copolymers	The compatibility of six kinds of designed poly (ethylene oxide)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PEO-b- PMMA) copolymers was studied at 270, 298 and 400 K via mesoscopic modeling. The values of the order parameters depended on both the structures of the block copolymers and the simulation temperature, while the values of the order parameters of the long chains were higher than those of the short ones; temperature had a more obvious effect on long chains than on the short ones. Plain copolymers doped with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) homopolymer showed different order parameter values. When a triblock copolymer had the same component at both ends and was doped with one of its component polymers as a homopolymer (such as A5B6A5 doped with B6 or A5 homopolymer), the value of its order parameter depended on the simulation temperature. The highest order parameter values were observed for A5B6A5 doped with B6 at 400 K and for A5B6A5 doped with A5 at 270 K. A study of copolymers doped with nanoparticles showed that the mesoscopic phase was influenced by not only the properties of the nanoparticles, such as the size and density, but also the compositions of the copolymers. Increasing the size of the nanoparticles used as a dopant had the most significant effect on the phase morphologies of the copolymers. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84859367090	Impact of interleukin-28B polymorphism on response to treatment in Chinese hepatitis C patients	The candidate polymorphism rs12979860 of interleukin 28B(IL28B) gene was genotyped by means of polymerase chain reaction(PCR) amplification and direct PCR sequencing, and then the role of this single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) in the response to the treatment of 172 Chinese patients with hepatitis C virus(HCV) chronic infection was analyzed. The results show that the frequencies of major homozygotes(CC) and heterozygotes(CT) of rs12979860 were 0.84 and 0.16, respectively, and the minor homozygotes(TT) wasn't found in this cohort. A highly significant association was found between the CC genotype and sustained virological response(SVR) in HCV genotype 1 infected patients(P<0.001) but not in HCV non-genotype 1 infected patients. In addition, a strong association was found between rs12979860 CC genotype and rapid virological response(RVR) in both HCV genotype 1 infected patients(P<0.001) and non-genotype 1 infected patients(P<0.001). Taken together, these results indicate that IL28B polymorphism plays a key role in response to hepatitis C therapy in Chinese patients. Combine assessment of clinical predictors and the IL28B polymorphism may be beneficial to the individualized treatment decision in Asian chronic hepatitis C(CHC) patients.

The tribological behaviors were examined on a four-ball friction and wear tester. The chemical characteristics of the tribofilms were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the obvious synergistic effects of better tribological performance between nitrided surface and organotungsten additive were attributed to WN formed in the tribofilm and a stronger adsorption of organic carbon chains and higher contents of C and W element in the tribofilm. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of the interlayer on the microstructure and thermal conductivity of the bonded specimen were investigated. The results showed that bonding quality was improved by using the interlayer. First, metallurgical bonding between W and W-Cu composite was obtained owing to the diffusion of Fe and the crystallization of amorphous W in the coating of the interlayer. Furthermore, both the thermal conductivity and relative thermal conductivity of the bonded specimen were increased because of the malleability of the interlayer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The values of the order parameters depend on the architectures of the block copolymers deeply, compared with their chain length. Furthermore, the values of order parameters of the copolymer in the same group are the same. A study of plain copolymers induced by 18 neutral surfaces shows that the microscopic phase is influenced by not only the peculiarities of the inducing surface, but also the architecture of copolymers. The degree of surface roughness plays themost significant role on changing phase separation, the rougher the surface, the higher ordered the microscopic phase.

84862312778	Synergistic Effects between Plasma-Nitrided AISI 52100 Steel and Zinc Dialkyldithiophosphate Additive under Boundary Lubrication	Plasma nitriding is applied to many industrial parts running in the boundary (or mixed) regime. It is necessary to understand the synergistic effect on tribological behavior between the nitrided steel surface and lubricant additive to achieve an effective performance. However, there has been very little work concerning the effect of plasma-nitrided steel on the tribochemical interactions of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) additive and the composition of ZDDP tribofilm. In this work, the interactions and synergistic tribological effects between the plasma-nitrided AISI 52100 steel surface and ZDDP additive under boundary lubrication were investigated. The tribological behavior of plasma-nitrided and untreated steels under lubrication with different ZDDP concentrations was examined on a four-ball friction and wear tester. The chemical characteristics of the tribofilms generated on the worn surfaces were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the obvious synergistic effects of better friction reduction and wear resistance between plasma-nitrided steel and ZDDP were attributed to the hard nitrided layer and the shorter chain phosphates tribofilm with greater carbon and phosphate contents. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Friction and wear behaviors of plasma nitrided AISI 52100 steel were examined on a four-ball friction and wear tester under lubrication of poly-α-olefin using ZDDP as an additive. Anti-wear and friction-reduction mechanisms were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The results show that plasma nitriding can significantly improve the surface hardness of steel. The nitrided steel exhibited lower friction coefficient and better anti-wear properties compared with that of the untreated steel. It was attributed to that the amount of orthophosphates on the nitrided AISI 52100 steel surface was higher than the amount of pyrophosphates on the AISI 52100 steel surface. The best tribological property can be obtained using 1.5% ZDDP.

Since VEGFs and their respective families of receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGFRs) are critical proteins which can regulate vascular development during angiogenesis, we decided to explore the inhibitory effects of soluble kinase insert domain-containing receptor(sKDR) on endothelial cells and angiogenesis. Total RNA was extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVEC), and cDNA of extracellular domains 1-4 was amplified and recombined with pQE40 vector. After being expressed, affinity purified, renatured and analyzed by Western blot, the sKDR was assayed for its effects on endothelial cells by [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide](MTT), and on angiogenesis by chick chorioallantoic membrane(CAM) experiment. sKDR cDNA of 1150 bp was obtained via real-time polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), and sKDR was expressed by pQE40 procaryotic expression system, purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis with only one band and proved by Western blot. MTT assay demonstrateds that sKDR could inhibit the VEGF-stimulated HUVEC from proliferation, and CAM experiment showed sKDR could block the VEGF-induced angiogenesis. sKDR has the biological activity to bind with VEGF ligands and is a potential target for tumor anti-angiogenesis therapy.

The results show that the microstructure of the test steels with different carbon content quenched at 950°C and tempered at 250°C is mainly composed of tempered lath martensite. But with the increasing of the carbon content, the microstructure coarsens slightly and there is a little of plate martensite in the microstructure. The hardness of the test steels increase with the carbon content increasing, but the toughness decreases. The results of wear tests show that the mechanism of the impact abrasive wear is chiseling and cutting wear and the steel with 0.38% carbon content has a better abrasive resistance. The mechanism of the static abrasive wear is cutting wear and the steel with 0.50% carbon content has a better abrasive resistance.

The effects of high-temperature annealing and the anti-oxidation properties of coated composites were investigated. The results showed that CVD-SiC coating, which was β-SiC phase, was fabricated successfully on the PIP-C/SiC with thickness of about 30. μm. It was clear that visible cracks existed and the ratio of weight loss increased with the annealing temperature increasing, while the flexural strength of coated composites greatly decreased with the elevation of the annealing temperature. Coated composites showed the best anti-oxidation ability at 1773. K (1.73. wt.%). During thermal cycle tests, the weight loss of coated sample was 0.68. wt.% and the percentage of remaining strength was 98.1%. The decrease of flexural strength during the tests was primarily due to the oxidation of the coated samples by oxygen or vapor. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Its surface morphologies, phase structure, and hardness are analyzed by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and microhardness tester. Its friction and wear behaviors are examined on a four-ball friction and wear tester under lubrication with borate containing nitrogen additive, compared with that of plain GCr15 steel. The composition and chemical binding state of tribofilm formed on the wear steel surface is analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS). The results show that an unexpected excellent synergistic effect occur between the nitrided surface and additive, the nitrided steel exhibits lower friction coefficient and better anti-wear properties compared with untreated steel, especially when 1.25% additive is used, the friction coefficient and wear scar diameter reduce by 34% and 45% separately. The main mechanism of this effect is attributed to that the borate containing nitrogen additive can produce a tribofilm containing higher content of BN on the nitrided surface, which is not found on the plain steel surface. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

Increasing the size and the number of the nanoparticles used as a dopant plays the most significant role on the phase morphologies of the copolymers at lower and higher temperatures, respectively. Especially, the 13214-type copolymers, which are PMMA-rich composition, present microscopic phase separation as varying degrees of lamellar phase morphologies at 443 K, alternated with PS and PMMA component. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84870909571	Sinomenine reduces iNOS expression via inhibiting the T-bet IFN-γ pathway in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats	Sinomenine is a bioactive alkaloid isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Sinomenium acutum. It is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug for treating rheumatic and arthritic diseases. In our previous studies, we found that sinomenine reduced cellular infiltration within the spinal cord and alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats. In this study, we further investigated the mechanisms of sinomenine treatment in EAE rats. In EAE rats, treatment with sinomenine exerted an anti-inducible NO synthase (anti-iNOS) effect, which is related to the reductions of Th1 cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and its transcription factor, T-bet, in spinal cords. Moreover, sinomenine treatment of splenocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody and recombinant rat interleukin 12 reduced the expression of T-bet and IFN-γ in vitro and also reduced the capability of supernatants of splenocyte culture to induce iNOS expression by primary astrocytes. However, sinomenine had no direct inhibitory effect on iNOS produced by astrocytes cultured with IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor α in vitro. In conclusion, the anti-iNOS effect of sinomenine on EAE is mediated via the suppression of T-bet/IFN-γ pathway. © 2012 The Editorial Board of Journal of Biomedical Research.

The results reveal that the electrostatic interactions play an important role in the stabilisation of the binding site of Stx2-adenosine, and the key residues of Ser113, Arg119, Arg125 and Arg170 in Stx2-adenosine complex are identified based on the residue decomposition analysis. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate that the substrate adenosine is located in the cavity formed by A-subunit, which is similar to the available experimental binding pattern of Stx2-adenine except for adenine being more close to the residues of Arg170, Tyr77 and Val78. The conformational difference that lies in adenosine is stabilised by the residues around the binding site of adenosine-Stx2, which leads to that the adenine base and furan ring of adenosine are dragged by the residues in the opposite direction during the catalytic process. The above results indicate that the residues around the binding site of adenosine in Stx2 should be used as catalytic active site to depurinate a specific adenine base from 28S rRNA. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84874734759	Enhancement of antiviral activity of human alpha-defensin 5 against herpes simplex virus 2 by arginine mutagenesis at adaptive evolution sites	Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection is still one of the common causes of sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. The prevalence of HSV strains resistant to traditional nucleoside antiviral agents has led to the development of novel antiviral drugs. Human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5), a kind of endogenous antimicrobial peptide expressed in the epithelia of the small intestine and urogenital tract, displays natural antiviral activity. Based on arginine-rich features and adaptive evolution characteristics of vertebrate defensins, we conducted a screen for HD5 derivatives with enhanced anti-HSV-2 activity by a single arginine substitution at the adaptive evolution sites. Cell protection assay and temporal antiviral studies showed that HD5 and its mutants displayed affirmatory but differential anti-HSV-2 effects in vitro by inhibiting viral adhesion and entry. Inspiringly, the E21R-HD5 mutant had significantly higher antiviral activity than natural HD5, which is possibly attributed to the stronger binding affinity of the E21R-HD5 mutant with HSV-2 capsid protein gD, indicating that E21R mutation can increase the anti-HSV-2 potency of HD5. In a mouse model of lethal HSV-2 infection,prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment with E21R-HD5 via intravaginal instillation remarkably alleviated the symptomsand delayed disease progress and resulted in about a 1.5-fold-higher survival rate than in the HD5 group. Furthermore, the E21R variant exhibited a 2-fold-higher antiviral potency against HIV-1 over parental HD5 in vitro. This study demonstrates that arginine mutagenesis at appropriate evolution sites may significantly enhance the antiviral activity of HD5, which also paves a facile way to search for potent antiviral drugs based on natural antimicrobial peptides. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

84875834442	Bonding tungsten, W-Cu-alloy and copper with amorphous Fe-W alloy transition	W/Cu graded materials are the leading candidate materials used as the plasma facing components in a fusion reactor. However, tungsten and copper can hardly be jointed together due to their great differences in physical properties such as coefficient of thermal expansion and melting point, and the lack of solid solubility between them. To overcome those difficulties, a new amorphous Fe-W alloy transitional coating and vacuum hot pressing (VHP) method were proposed and introduced in this paper. The morphology, composition and structure of the amorphous Fe-W alloy coating and the sintering interface of the specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The thermal shock resistance of the bonded composite was also tested. The results demonstrated that amorphous structure underwent change from amorphous to nano grains during joining process, and the joined W/Cu composite can endued plasma thermal shock resistance with energy density more than 5.33 MW/m

84876315287	High-throughout screening with computer of a inhibitor of aurora a and docking study	Aurora A is a key member of a closely related subgroup of serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the completion of essential mitotic events. In order to design a potent inhibitor for aurora A, H-89 is selected as lead compound and AutoDock vina is used to dock. In the end, the new compound with the lowest binding energy with aurora A is selected to further investigation. The docking results show that the new compound (named H-89-1) is a better inhibitor than that of H-89 and Thr217 and Arg137 are important in inhibition as they form hydrogen bonds and have strong nonbonding interaction with the new inhibitor. Our results will be helpful for further experimental investigations.

84878883435	Influence of W content on microstructural, mechanical and tribological properties of sulfurized W-doped diamond-like carbon coatings	A series of sulfurizedWdoped diamond-like carbon (W-DLC) coatings were prepared using a two-step method as depositing W-DLC coating firstly, and then treated by low temperature ion sulfuration. A designing thought of a composite DLC with sulfide coating with optimized mechanical and tribological properties was realized. The structural analyses were performed on the scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), scanning Auger microprobe (SAM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscope. The mechanical and tribological properties were evaluated by the nanoindenter and ball-on-disk friction and wear tester. The results show that the microstructures, mechanical and tribological properties of sulfurized W-DLC coatings exhibited a significant dependence on the W concentration. A high fraction of W in W-DLC coating promoted the formation of WC which could prevent the S diffusion and the extent of graphitization for sulfurized W-DLC coatings. The hardness of sulfurized W-DLC coating gradually increased with higher W concentration, and it was lower than that of the untreated W-DLC coating. The coefficient of friction and wear rate of sulfurized W-DLC coating were reduced with the increase ofWcontent. The best tribological properties with the lowest friction coefficient and wear rate were achieved on sulfurized 27.7% W-DLC coating. The tribological mechanism was attributed to the graphite-rich and sulfide composite top layer with lower shear strength and combining a support of the sublayer W-DLC coating with better mechanical property. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84882595605	Polymorphism of A118G in μ-opioid receptor gene is associated with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese population	Background: Previous studies have indicated a direct effect of μ-opioid receptors on tumor progression or recurrence. An A118G polymorphism in the μ-opioid receptor gene was believed to play an important role in this carcinogenic process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the A118G polymorphism and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a Chinese population. Method: The case-control study included 260 cancer patients and 291 controls from a Chinese Han and Chinese TuJia population in Enshi region, China. Genotypes were determined by TaqMan platform. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression. Results: Compared with the G/G genotype, the A/A genotype exhibited a significantly elevated risk for ESCC (OR = 3.12, 95 % CI [1], 1.11-6.01). A significant interaction between the A118G polymorphism and age, smoking status, and family history of cancer was also found (OR = 2.25, 95 % CI 1.36-4.12; OR = 1.75, 95 % CI 1.23-2.32; OR = 3.14, 95 % CI 1.31-7.28, respectively). Conclusion: The A118G polymorphism in the μ-opioid receptor gene might be associated with the risk of ESCC in Chinese population. © 2012 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.

0039721687	Influence of trace elements and heat treatment on carbide morphology and properties of CD-2 steel	The purpose of the current investigation was to develop a modified ledeburite cast die steel with granular carbide, which, different from the conventional ledeburite cast die steel CD-2 with network carbide, had higher strength and toughness. By adding trace elements, grain and eutectic in the steel were refined, with a concomitant increase in divorced eutectic and decrease in segregation of Cr and Mo. After heat treatment between 1100 and 1130°C, network carbide changed into a granular form. As a result, the modified CD-2 steel with granular carbide gave higher impact toughness, fracture toughness and resistance to fatigue crack propagation compared to conventional CD-2 steel. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.
