84946184085	Diagnostic value of aberrant methylation of genes in stool for colorectal tumor: A meta-analysis	Objective To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the aberrant methylation of genes in stool for colorectal tumor. Methods Databases including The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMbase, CBM, Web of Science, CNKI and WanFang Data were searched to collect the diagnostic trials on the aberrant methylation of genes in stool for colorectal tumor published from January 1990 to February 2012. QUADAS items were used to evaluate the quality of the included studies, and the meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-Disc 1.4 software. Results A total of 32 studies involving 3 951 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that, for detecting the colorectal tumor, the weighted sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and Q* were 92% (95%CI 91% to 93%), 63% (95%CI 61% to 65%), 20.79 (95%CI 15.13 to 28.57), 0.861 9 (SE=0.020 4), and 0.792 6 (SE=0.019 8), respectively. For detecting the colorectal cancer, the weighted sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) were 91% (95%CI 89% to 92%), 75% (95%CI 73% to 77%), and 0.900 7, respectively. For detecting the colorectal adenoma, the weighted sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 79% (95%CI 76% to 83%), 75% (95%CI 73% to 77%), and 0.845 7, respectively. Conclusion With high sensitivity (92%) and moderate specificity (63%), aberrant methylation of genes in stool can be used as an optional noninvasive method for the diagnosis of colorectal tumor. © 2013 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

16244362054	CpG island methylation and expression of thrombospondin 1 gene in colorectal adenocarcinoma	AIM: To investigate the relationship among the aberrant methylation of the promoter CpG islands of thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) gene, its protein expression, and the clinico-pathological features of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC). METHODS: The methylation status of promoter CpG islands and the protein expression of THBS1 gene in the tumors and the adjacent normal mucosal tissues of 94 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma were detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and immunohistochemical technique, respectively. RESULTS: The rate of THBS1 gene protein expression (61.7% vs 77.7%, P = 0.017) and CpG island methylation (25.5% vs 11.7%, P = 0.015) in tissues of CRAC were significantly different from those in cancer-adjacent tissues. The rate of THBS1 protein expression was markedly different between the elderly and non-elderly CRAC patients (48.8% vs 72.5%, P = 0.018), between the tumors with larger size (≥ 3 cm in diameter) and small size (53.4% vs 75.0%, P = 0.037), as well as between the tumors in Dukes C, D stages and Dukes A or B stages (44.4% vs 73.3% or 72.1%, P = 0.025). The rate of THBS1 CpG island methylation was higher the in elderly CRAC patients than that in the non-elderly CRAC ones (37.2% vs 15.7%, P = 0.017), in the large size tumor than that in small one (32.6% vs 13.9%, P = 0.041), and in Dukes C, D stages than that in Dukes A or B stages (41.7% vs 13.3%, 16.3%, P = 0.018). The rate of THBS1 CpG island methylation was significantly different between CRAC with positive and negative protein expression (0% vs 66.7%, P<0.0005). CONCLUSION: The aberrant methylation of THBS1 gene is the main cause for the loss of its protein expression, which plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of CRAC.

20344366808	Syndecan-1 and E-cadherin expression in differentiated type of early gastric cancer	Aim: To elucidate the role and alterations of syndecan-1 and E-cadherin expression in different cellular phenotypes of differentiated-type gastric cancers (DGCs). Methods: A total of 120 DGCs at an early stage, and their adjacent mucosa, were studied both by immunohistochemistry. Syndecan-1 and E-cadherin were assessed by immunohistochemical staining with anti-syndecan-1 and anti-E-cadherin antibodies, respectively. Based on immunohistochemistry, DGCs and their surrounding mucosa were divided into four types: gastric type (G-type), ordinary type (O-type), complete-intestinal type (CI-type), and null type (N-type). Results: Syndecan-1 expression was significantly lower in G-type cancers (29.4%) than in O-type (79.6%) and CI-type cancers (90%) (P<0.05, respectively), but E-cadherin did not show this result. In addition, syndecan-1 expression was significantly reduced in DGCs comprised partly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or signet-ring cell carcinoma, compared to DGCs demonstrating papillary and/or tubular adenocarcinoma (P<0.05). G-type intestinal metaplasia (IM) surrounding the tumors was observed in 23.8% of G-type, 4.9% of O-type, and 6.7% of CI-type cancers (P<0.05; G-type vs O-type). Reduction of syndecan-1 expression was significant in G-type IM (25%) compared to non-G-type IM (75%; P<0.05). Conclusion: Loss of syndecan-1 plays a role in the growth of G-type cancers of DGCs at an early stage, and the reduction of syndecan-1 expression in IM surrounding the tumors may influence the growth of G-type cancer. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

33645463411	Clinical significance and expression of angiopoietin-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-7 in human colorectal carcinoma	AIM: To investigate the expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) protein in human colorectal carcinoma, and to explore the relationship between the two proteins and clinical parameters. METHODS: Immunohistochemical technique was used to detect the expression of Ang-2 and MMP-7 protein in 40 colorectal carcinoma and their adjacent normal tissues. RESULTS: The positive rates of Ang-2 and MMP-7 were significantly higher in colorectal carcinoma than those in normal tissues (77.5% vs 40%, P = 0.001; 85% vs 35%, P = 0.000). The level of Ang-2 expression had no marked correlations with the sex and age of patients as well as the site, size, lymph node metastasis or histological differentiation of colorectal carcinoma (all P > 0.05), but it was notably correlated with the invasion depth (P = 0.007), distal metastasis (P = 0.023) and Dukes' staging (P = 0.008). The expression of Ang-2 and MMP-7 were also significantly correlated (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: High expression of Ang-2 protein may play an important role in the progression and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma through up-regulation of MMP-7 expression.

33746009637	Expression induction and mutation of connexin genes in human colonic cancer	Objective: To study the expression of connexin(Cx) genes and the effects of a variety of inducers on the expression changes of Cx and mutation of Cx coding sequences in human colonic cancer. Methods: Northern Blot, RT-PCR and PCR-single strand confonnational polymorphism were used. Results: There were regular expression patterns of Cx genes in human normal colonic epithelium, paracancerous tissues and colonic cancer tissues. RA and DMSO could induce the expression of Cx43 in colonic cancers tissues and decrease of Cx46 expression by RA and TPA inducton. There was not any mutation in Cx43 coding sequences. Conclusion: Cx32 gene may be a specific gene in genome of colonic epithelium constructing gap junctional interllular communication. The down-regulation of Cx43 expression is not caused by mutation of coding sequences in human colonic cancers. The authors propose a hypothesis on the variation of expression of Cx genes in human colonic cancer.

33746331030	Expression of angiopoietin-2 and its clinical significance in colorectal carcinoma	Objective: To study the expression of Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) protein in colorectal carcinoma and evaluate the relationship between Ang-2 protein level and clinical parameters. Methods: Expression of Ang-2 was examined in 40 colorectal carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemical technique. Results: The positive rate of Ang-2 protein was significantly higher in colorectal carcinoma than in normal tissues (77.5% vs 40%, P<0.01). Neither patients' gender nor age correlated with the expression level of Ang-2 (both P>0.05). No correlations were found between the expression level of Ang-2 and the site, size or histological differentiation of colorectal carcinoma (P>0.05). The expression level of Ang-2 in colorectal carcinoma with lymph node metastasis was not different from that without lymph node metastasis (P>0.05). The positive rate of Ang-2 protein was higher in projecting carcinoma of colorectum than in ulcerative carcinoma of colorectum (P<0.01), was lower in colorectal carcinoma of Dukes' A stage than that of Dukes' D stage (P<0.01), and was higher in colorectal carcinoma with metastasis from blood vessels than that without metastasis from blood vessels (P<0.05). The deeper extent of infiltrating, the higher, the Ang-2 positive rate was (P<0.01). Conclusion: The expression level of Ang-2 protein might be related to the shape of colorectal carcinoma, invasion ability, blood vessel metastasis and Dukes' staging in colorectal carcinoma. It is suggested that high expression of Ang-2 protein may play an important role in the progression and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma.

33747000840	Correlation between thymidine phosphorylase expression and hepatic metastasis in human gastric cancer	Objective: To study the expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP)/platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor(PD-ECGF), microvessel density (MVD) in gastric carcinoma tissues and their clinical signification. Methods: TP/PD-ECGF protein expression and microvessel density(MVD) in 120 samples of gastric carcinoma was examined by means of immunohistochemical staining S-P method, and the relationship of TP/PD-ECGF, MVD with their clinical pathological characteristics and the prognosis of gastric cancers was analysed. Results: The MVD was significantly higher in TP-positive tumours than in TP-negative tumours. The TP expression closely correlated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and venous invasion of tumours, and the frequency of hepatic metastasis was significantly higher in patients with TP-positive tumours than that in patients with TP-negative tumours. MVD positively correlated with size of tumour, Dukes period, lymph node metastasis, venous invasion and depth of invasion(P < 0.01), but showed no significant correlation with the histologic type(P > 0.05). Conclusion: TP/PD-ECGF highly correlates with angiogenesis of gastric carcinoma, and promotes growth invasion and hepatic metastasis of gastric carcinoma. TP/PD-ECGF expression or MVD may be one of the predictors of the biological behaviors of gastric carcinoma, and both may serve as the prognostic factors and be helpful for decision on the therapy.

33750177719	Effects of doxycycline on expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 in gastric cancer cells SGC-7901	Background: Doxycycline could inhibit the proliferation of colonic cancer cells. However, its effect on gastric cancer cells has not been reported. Aims: To observe the inhibitory effect of doxycycline on the growth of human gastric cancer cells (SGC-7901) and the effect on expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and to explore new therapeutic approach in the treatment of gastric cancer. Methods: SGG-7901 cells were treated with different concentrations of doxycycline and its growth inhibitory effect was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTI) method. The mRNA expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method; the expression of MMP-2 protein was examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: The growth of SGC-7901 cells was inhibited by doxycycline in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). Doxycycline decreased the expression of MMP-2 mRNA and MMP-2 protein, but increased the expression of TIMP-2 mRNA dose-dependently (P<0.05). Conclusions: Doxycycline can inhibit the proliferation of SGC-7901, which may be related to its effect of down-regulating MMP-2 and up-regulating TIMP-2.

33749492804	Clinical significance of albuminuria in inflammatory bowel disease	Objective: To investigate the changes and clinical significance of albuminuria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD)during various stages. Methods: 32 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 25 healthy controls were recruited in this study. Albaminuria was measured by immuno-biditimetric method and analyzed with clinical acting index. Results: Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease had higher concentrations of albuminuria compared with patients in remission (P < 0.002). There was a significant correlation with the simple index of Harvey and Bradshaw (Patients in active r = 0.76, P < 0.001; in remission r = 0.73, P < 0.001). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had higher concentration of albuminuria compared with normal controls (Patients in active, P < 0.001; in remission P < 0.005). Conclusion: Albaminuria is a parameter of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.

33845427638	Hypermethylation and expression regulation of secreted frizzled-related protein genes in colorectal tumor	Aim: To investigate the functions of promoter hypermethylation of secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) genes in colorectal tumorigenesis and progression. Methods: The promoter hypermethylation and expression of sFRP genes in 72 sporadic colorectal carcinomas, 33 adenomas, 18 aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and colorectal cancer cell lines RKO, HCT116 and SW480 were detected by methylation-specific PCR and reverse transcription PCR, respectively. Results: None of the normal colorectal mucosa tissues showed methylated bands of any of four sFRP genes. sFRP1, 2, 4 and 5 were frequently methylated in colorectal carcinoma, adenoma and ACF (sFRP1 > 85%, sFRP2 >75%, sFRP5 > 50%), and the differences between three colorectal tissues were not significant (P > 0.05). Methylation in colorectal tumors was more frequent than in normal mucosa and adjacent normal mucosa. The mRNA of sFRP1-5 genes was expressed in all normal colorectal mucosa samples. Expression of sFRP1, 2, 4 and 5 and sFRP1, 2 and 5 was downregulated in carcinoma and adenoma, respectively. The downregulation of sFRP2, 4 and 5 was more frequent in carcinoma than in adenoma. Expression of sFRP3 which promoter has no CpG island was downregulated in only a few of colorectal tumor samples (7/105). The downregulation of sFRP1, 2, 4 and 5 expression was significantly associated with promoter hypermethylation in colorectal tumor. After cells were treated by DAC/TSA combination, the silenced sFRP mRNA expression could be effectively re-expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines. Conclusion: Hypermethylation of sFRP genes is a common early event in the evolution of colorectal tumor, occurring frequently in ACF, which is regarded as the earliest lesion of multistage colorectal carcinogenesis. It appears to functionally silence sFRP genes expression. Methylation of sFRP1, 2 and 5 genes might serve as indicators for colorectal tumor. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

33751291279	Relationship between gastric emptying of liquids and serum gastrin, plasma motilin, somatostation concentrations in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus	Objective: To study the mechanism of gastric motor dysfunction (gastroparesis) in type 2 diabetes mellitus(DM). Methods: The gastric half-emptying time of liquids and the serum gastrin, plasma motilin, somatostation concentrations were studied in 32 elderly patients with type 2 DM and 20 normal controls by real-time ultrasonography and radioimmunoassay. Results: Gastric half-emptying time of liquids was delayed in elderly patients with type 2 DM as compared to that of controls (P < 0.01); The serum gastrin concentrations and plasma motilin concentrations increased and plasma somatostation concentrations decreased significantly of type 2 DM Group 1(patients with delayed gastric liquid emptying, n = 19) than that of type 2 DM Group 2(patients with normal gastric liquid emptying, n = 13); There were an excellent correlation between the gastric half-emptying time and gastrin concentrations (r = 0.941), motilin concentrations (r = 0.925), somatostations concentrations (r = -0.938) in elderly patients with type 2 DM. Conclusion: Dysfunctions of gastric motility closely correlated with the increasing of gastrin, motilin secretion and the decreasing of somatostation secretion in patients with type 2 DM. Gastrin, motilin and somatostation play important roles in the pathologenetic mechanisms of gastroparesis.

33845472266	Expression of CK20 and PCNA in gastric carcinoma and its clinical significance	Objective: To study the expression of CK20 and PCNA in gastric carcinoma to discuss its clinical significance. Methods: The expression of CK20 and PCNA in the tumor tissues from 30 patients with gastric carcinoma was examined immunohistochemistrically by the SP method. Results: The expression of CK20 in gastric carcinoma was related with the differentiation, clinical pathologic stage, lymph metastasis and depth of invasion (P < 0.05). The clinical pathologic stage, the differentiation of adenocarcinoma and lymph metastasis were correlated with the positive rate of PCNA expression (all P<0.05). A positive correlation was noted between expression of CK20 and PCNA (r=0.472, P=0.007). Neither the expression of CK20 nor PCNA in gastric carcinoma was correlated with sex, age and histological type (all P>0.05). Conclusion: Combining detection of CK20 and PCNA expression can offer a valuable reference to evaluate the metastasis and prognosis in gastric carcinoma.

33751341526	Relationship to the expression of matrilysin and the progression of early colorectal carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the correlation of MMP-7 mRNA expression with the progression of early colorectal carcinoma. Methods: RT-PCR technique was used to measure the expression of MMP-7 mRNA in clinical specimens, and matrilysin protein of early colorectal cancers at the invasive front was immunohistochenically analyzed. Results: MMP-7 mRNA was observed in 90% (27/30) early colorectal carcinoma while it was almost undetectable in normal mucosas. MMP-7 mRNA was observed in 7 case of 45 ACF and observed. In all case of 10 colorectal adenomas and 20 advanced colorectal cancers. The level of MMP-7 mRNA gradually increased from normal muscosas, ACF, adenomas, early colorectal cancers to advanced colorectal cancers (P < 0.01). MMP-7 protein was observed immunostainingly in more than 30% of cancer cells at the invasive front of 46% (14/30) early colorectal cancers. The level of MMP-7 increased in parallel with the depth of invasion (P < 0.05). The level of MMP-7 in cancers with metastasis was higher than that with no metastasis (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The over-expression of MMP-7 may play an important role in infiltration and metastasis of early colorectal carcinoma.

34948832199	The role of secreted Wnt-antagonist genes hypermethylation in early detection of colorectal tumor	Objective: To investigate the functions of promoter hypermethylation of secreted Wnt-antagonist genes in colorectal tumorigenesis and progression. Methods: Two colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116 and SW480, were treated by 5 -aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) and trichostatin A (TSA) for demethylation. The promoter hypermethylation and expression of sFRP and WIF-1 genes in different stages of colorectal tumor and colorectal cancer cell lines were detected by methylation-specific PCR and reverse transcription PCR, respectively. Results: None of the normal colorectal mucosa samples showed methylated bands of any sFRP and WIF-1genes. Hypermethylation of sFRP1, 2, 4, 5 and WIF-1 was detected in 93.1% (67/72), 83.3% (60/72), 36.1% (26/72), 52.8% (38/72) and 84.7% (61/72) of adenocarcinomas, 87. 9% (29/33), 81. 8% (27/ 33), 24.2% (8/33), 57. 6% (19/33) and 72.7% (24/33) of adenomas, 52.6%, 28.9%, 2.6%, 18.4%, 23.7% of the adjacent normal mucosa. Methylation was more frequently found in colorectal tumors than in normal mucosa and adjacent normal mucosa from patients with tumor (P < 0.05). No significant association between Wnt-antagonist genes hypermethylation and clinicopathological characteristics was found (P > 0.05). SFRP1, 2, 4, 5 and WIF-1 genes were methylated in HCT116 cell line. SFRP1, 2 and WIF-1 were methylated in SW480 cell line. The mRNA expression of sFRPs and WIF-1 genes was absent or significantly downregulated. (P < 0.01) when they were methylated in two colorectal cancer cell lines. SFRP3 was expressed in two colorectal carcinoma cell lines. DAC/TSA combination treatment re-expressed the silenced sFRPs and WIF-1 genes mRNA expressions effectively. A single application of TSA could not re-express sFRPs and WIF-1 genes mRNA expressions. The influence of demethylation treatment on sFRP3 expression was minimal. Conclusion: Hypermethylation of Wnt-antagonist genes is a common early event in the evolution of colorectal tumor. Methylation of sFRP1, 2, 5 and WIF-1 genes might serve as biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal tumor.

34948834154	Combined effect and anti-tumor mechanism of triptolide and 5-fluorouracil on HT-29 cells in vitro	Objective: To study the effects of triptolide (TPL) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on proliferation and apoptosis of human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 in vitro. Methods: HT-29 cells were cultured with RPMI1640 medium in regular condition. The inhibition effects were evaluated by MTT assay. The subcellular morphology was observed by transmission electron microscope. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The changes of bcl-2 and p53 in protein level were quantified by immunocytochemistry. Results: 1 TPL and 5-FU either combined or alone inhibited significantly the proliferation of HT-29 cells and induced obvious apoptosis. Growth inhibition rate arrived at (94. 92 ± 2. 76)%, and apoptic rate at 48 h reached (41. 71 ± 1. 38)%. 2 The interaction of the two drugs was synergistic (CI<1) at lower concentrations. The mechanism may partly attribute to cell apoptosis. 3 TPL and 5-FU affected p53 protein expression but did not affect expression of bcl-2 protein. Conclusion: The interaction of TPL and 5-FU was synergistic at lower concentrations. The apoptosis may be dependent on the p53 and independent on bcl-2 passway. The result may play an important role in the treatment of colon cancer.

34249092004	Synergistic effect of triptolide combined with 5-fluorouracil on colon carcinoma	Aim: To investigate the inhibitive effects of triptolide (TPL) combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on colon carcinoma HT-29 cells in vitro and in vivo and their side effects. Methods: HT-29 cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium. The single or combined effects of TPL and 5-FU on HT-29 cells were examined by MTT assay, flow cytometry. The combined effects were evaluated by the median-effect principle. The model of tumour xenografts was established in nude mice. TPL 0.25 mg/kg/day and 5-FU 12 mg/kg/day, either in combination or on their own, were injected into mice and the inhibitive effects and side effects were observed. Results: TPL and 5-FU either combined or alone inhibited significantly the proliferation of HT-29 cells and induced obvious apoptosis. Mean (SD) growth inhibition rate reached 94.92 (2.76)% and the apoptic rate at 48 h reached 41.71 (1.38)%. The combined effects were synergistic (CI<1) at lower concentrations. TPL or 5-FU alone inhibited significantly the growth of tumour xenografts and the inhibition rates were 78.53% and 84.16%; the drugs combined had more significant effect, the tumour inhibition rate reaching 96.78%. During the course of chemotherapy, no obvious side effect was observed. Conclusion: The combined effects of TPL and 5-FU on the growth of colon carcinoma in vitro and in vivo were superior to the effects when the agents were used individually. TPL combined with 5-FU had synergistic effects at lower concentrations and promoted apoptosis, but did not increase the side effects of chemotherapy.

80052883098	Loss of Reprimo and S100A2 expression in human gastric adenocarcinoma	Reprimo and S100A2 are two newly identified candidate tumor-suppressor genes, which play an important role in the regulation of p53-dependent cell cycle. In this study, we examined the expressions of Reprimo and S100A2 in surgical specimens of gastric adenocarcinoma and correlated these results with pathological and clinical parameters. Tissues were obtained from 100 gastric adenocarcinoma patients that underwent curative gastrectomy. Reprimo and S100A2 expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. Loss of Reprimo and S100A2 expressions occurred in 65 and 52% of the patients, respectively. Loss of Reprimo expression was significantly correlated with the depth of tumor invasion (P = 0.000), lymphatic vessel invasion (P = 0.006), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.000). Loss of S100A2 expression was significantly associated with histological type (P = 0.009), depth of invasion (P = 0.033), lymphatic vessel invasion (P = 0.01), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001). In addition, there was a significant positive association between the expressions of Reprimo and S100A2 (P < 0.01). The results suggest that loss of Reprimo and S100A2 expressions occurs frequently in gastric adenocarcinomas. The expressions of Reprimo and S100A2 may be potential biomarkers for gastric adenocarcinomas detection. Diagn. Cytopathol. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

43749089967	Influence of desloratadine on rat enter-mast cells	Objective: To study the influence of desloratadine on rat enter-mast cells. Methods: Thirty SD male rats were divided into three groups randomly: control group, stress group and stress - desloratadin group. Rats in stress group and stress+desloratadine group were treated with chronic unpredicted mild stress. Open-field method was used to observe the change of the fecal pellet and rat behaviors (crossover and rearing). At the end of the experiment, with the method of rectal balloon distention, the perception thresholds and the number of abdominal withdrawal reflexes (AWR) of different balloon volume were observed as well as the effects of desloratadine on the numbers and the degranulation of rat mast cells. Results: The stress group rats had more conspicuous anxiety-like behaviors than the control group did (P<0. 05), but the behaviors seemed less in the stress+desloratadin group than in stress group (P<0. 05). The perception threshold of the stress and stress+desloratadin group was lower than that of control group (both P<0. 05). The number of AWR to the balloon content (1. 0 ml or 2. 0 ml) was higher in the stress group than that in the control group (P<0. 05), while was also higher than that in the stress+desloratadin group. The average fluorescence intensity of mast cells protein-1(mcp-1) in the stress group was less than that in control group and in the stress group (both P<0. 05). Conclusion: Chronic stress is associated with increased rectal motor activity, anxiety-like behaviors, and numbers of colonic mast cells. Desloratadine can decrease the number of mast cells in chronic stress rats, which may abirritate visceral hypersensitivity of chronic stress rats.

SGC-7901 cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium. The single or combined effects of EGCG (0.1, 1, 10, 20, and 40 μmol/L) and heat shock were examined by MTT assay. The expression of HSP 70 and MDR 1 was semi-quantified by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry method (SP staining). EGCG suppressed cell proliferation at a time- and dose-dependent manner. The effects of combined treatment with EGCG and heat shock on the growth of SGC-7901 cells were stronger than single effects of EGCG. After using EGCG for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, the IC50s were 112.5 μmol/1, 21.41 μmol/1 and 5.24 μmol/1, respectively. Heat shock stimulated the over-expression of HSP 70, especially after heat shock for 8 h, as well as MDR1 after heat shock for 24 h. But EGCG suppressed the over-expression induced by heat shock. The authors conclude that EGCG inhibited the proliferation of SGC-7901, and EGCG combined with heat shock strengthened the effects. Heat shock weakened the over-expression of HSP 70 and MDR1; however, EGCG suppressed the over-expression of HSP 70 and MDR1 induced by heat shock. EGCG combined with heat shock may enhance the sensitivity of drugs to tumors. © E.S.I.F.T. srl.

52449116724	Targeting the most upstream site of Wnt signaling pathway provides a strategic advantage for therapy in colorectal cancer	The Wnt signaling pathway has important functions in development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. Deregulation of canonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling is frequently found in various human cancers, particularly in colorectal cancer, and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways also have been implicated in neoplasia. Colorectal cancer is a multi-pathway disease. Activation of Wnt signaling by both genetic and epigenetic alterations has been found to be important for both, initiation and progression of colorectal cancer. In addition, since Wnt signaling results in diverse downstream intracellular events, targeted inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling at the most upstream site of this pathway is a rational and an advantageous new approach for the therapy of colorectal cancer. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

57149108936	Protective effects of bombesin on endotoxin-induced intestinal injury in rats	AIM: To investigate the protective effects of bombesin on endotoxin-induced intestinal injury in SD rats. METHODS: A total of 96 SD rats were divided randomly into 3 groups. Group A was served as control group and administrated normal saline (1 mL/kg). Group B was the model group and treated with LPS (intraperitoneally, 5 mg/kg). Rats in Group C were firstly treated with bombesin (subcutaneously, 10 μg/kg, three times a day) for 7 d, and then injected with LPS intraperitoneally. Following LPS administration, intestinal tissues were collected at 2, 6, 24 h separately for Malondialdehyde (MDA) and GSH-PX study, and blood samples were collected for IL-6 and IL-10 study. RESULTS: According to the macroscopic and microscopic findings, group C showed significantly lower damage and inflammation compared with group B. At 2, 6, 24 h, the intestinal MDA levels were significantly lower in group C than in group B (3.4092 ± 0.7765 vs 8.4359 ± 0.5589; 4.6588 ± 0.3311 vs 10.9375 ± 1.00094; 4.6324 ± 0.2278 vs 10.5074 ± 1.0142, all P < 0.01), but still higher than that in group A. The intestinal GSH-PX levels were significantly higher in group C than in group B (2 h: 1231.83 ± 74.68 vs 766.67± 57.94; 6 h: 2113.34 ± 81.42 vs 749.09 ± 56.72; 24 h: 1950.48 ± 72.74 vs 785.62 ± 62.43, all P < 0.01). At 2, 24 h, the IL-6 levels were lower in group C than in group B (2 h: 553.70 ± 23.03 vs 652.81 ± 27.09; 6 h: 494.52 ± 40.68 vs 606.68 ± 43.60; 24 h: 571.56 ± 52.54 vs 602.73 ± 25.19, all P < 0.01), but still higher than in group A. At every time, the IL-10 levels were higher in group C than in group B (2 h: 601.58 ± 30.65, vs 478.76 ± 23.49; 6 h: 653.77 ± 35.75 vs 469.35 ± 11.27; 24 h: 714.04 ± 29.55 vs 635.17 ± 29.15, all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bombesin has the function of anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation by increasing the levels of GSH-PX and IL-10 and decreasing the levels of MDA and IL-6.

62749170040	Expressions of hMLHl, hMSH2, c-Myc, and PTEN in gastric remnant cancer and their significance	Objective: To compare the expression of hMLHl, hMSH2, c-Myc and PTEN in normal gastric mucosa, gastric remnant mucosa, gastric remnant cancer (GRC) and gastric cancer(GC), and to investigate their roles in carcinogenesis and development of gastric remnant cancer. Methods: The SP immunohistochemical method was applied to detect the expression rate of hMLHl, hMSH2, c-myc and PTEN gene in normal gastric mucosa, gastric remnant mucosa, gastric remnant cancer and gastric cancer. Results: The expression rate of hMLHl(50. 0%) and hMSH2 (44. 4%) was significantly decreased in GRC, compared with that in normal gastric mucosa (100. 0% and 100. 0% respectively) (P<0. 01), while was not different from that in GC(68. 4% and 63. 2%, respectively). The positive expression of c-Myc in gastric remnant mucosa(45. 0%) was higher than in normal gastric mucosa(0. 0%) (P<0. 05). There was no difference in positive expression rate of c-Myc protein between GRC (61. 1%) and GC(55. 3%). The positive expression rate of PTEN was observed and was downregulated in GRC(44. 4%) and GC(47. 4%), but no significant differences were observed between the two groups. Conclusion: GRC might be associated with the inactivation of mismatch repair gene. Increased expression of c-Myc protein and reduced expression of PTEN protein might be important in the tumorigenesis and progression of GRC.

77950930729	Expression and functional research of TLR4 in human colon carcinoma	Introduction: To verify whether human colon carcinoma cells can express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and investigate the biological function of TLR4 on human colon carcinoma cells. Methods: Human colon carcinoma cells SW480 was cultured with RPMI 1640 medium. The expression of TLR4 was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and quantified by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was evaluated by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The production of transforming growth factor-β, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-8 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-the TLR4 ligand was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whether mitogen-associated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) proteins were activated was analyzed by Western blot. Apoptosis was analyzed by Annenxin V/PI staining. Results: TLR4 is expressed on SW480 cells. LPS could not affect TLR4 expression and the proliferation of SW480 cells. LPS increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38 and activated NF-κB. LPS promoted the production of vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, and interleukin-8. In addition, LPS induced resistance of SW480 cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, NF-κB activation was necessary for apoptosis resistance of SW480 cells induced by LPS. CONCLUSION: TLR4 is expressed on human colon carcinoma cells and functionally active. It may play important roles in promoting immune escape of human colon carcinoma cells by inducing immunosuppressive factors and apoptosis resistance.

78049500375	Involvement of mitochondrial pathway in NCTD-induced cytotoxicity in human hepG2 cells	Background. Norcantharidin, the demethylated analog of cantharidin derived from a traditional Chinese medicine, Mylabris, has been used in the treatment of anti-cancer effects. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process are generally unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of NCTD-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Methods. The cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay for cellular viability and by flow cytometry. The mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. The role of caspase activities were assayed using caspase apoptosis detection kit . Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the level of Cyto-C, Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, caspase 3, -9, -8 and PARP expression. Results. After treatment with NCTD, a decrease in the viability of HepG2 cells and increase in apoptosis were observed. NCTD-induced apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in ROS production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c(cyto-c) from the mitochondria to the cytosol and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 levels with concurrent up-regulation in pro-apoptotic protein Bax levels. However, another pro-apoptotic molecule, Bid, showed no change in such same treatment. NCTD-increased activity of caspase 9,caspase 3 and the subsequent cleavage caspase substrate PARP were also observed. The expression levels of pro-caspase-8 were not changed after NCTD treatment. Conclusion. These results indicate that NCTD induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells by apoptosis, which is mediated through ROS generation and mitochondrial pathway. © 2010 Chang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78651095517	The anti-proliferative effects of norcantharidin on human HepG2 cells in cell culture	Many lines of evidence have shown that Chinese medicine contains many chemical compounds with anticancer effects. Therefore, we tested whether the active ingredients of blister beetles have a therapeutic effect on hepatoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitive effects of norcantharidin which is extracted from blister beetles on human hepatoma cells HepG2 in vitro and its anticancer mechanism.MTT assay, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry were used to evaluate HepG2 cells proliferation and apoptosis. The role of caspase activities were assayed using caspase apoptosis detection kit. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the level of Bcl-2/Bax expression. Our results indicate that norcantharidin inhibited HepG2 cell growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner by MTT assay. HepG2 cells treated with norcantharidin showed typical characteristics of apoptosis including the DNA fragmentation. The activities of caspase-3, -9 were up-regulated after norcantharidin treatment. By western blot analysis, we found the level of Bcl-2 were down-regulated, whereas, the level of Bcl-2 Up-regulated.so we suggest that up-regulation of mitochondrial Bax expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression participated in the apoptosis induced by NCTD. These results suggest that norcantharidin triggers apoptosis in hepato cancer cell lines via the activation of the caspses, mitochondrial pathways, and that this agent may be useful for developing new therapeutic regimens for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79952084714	Effect of norcantharidin on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatoma HepG2 cells	Objective: To study the influence of norcantharidin (NCTD) on the proliferation, apoptosis and survivin expression of human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Methods: MTT assay was used to investigate the effect of NCTD on proliferation of HepG2 cells; Hochest 33258 staining, Annenxin V/PI staining, and agarose gel electrophoresis assay were used to examine the effect of NCTD on apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Western blotting analysis was used to examine the effect of NCTD on survivin expression in HepG2 cells. Results: Proliferation of HepG2 cells was markedly inhibited by NCTD in a dose-dependent manner (5, 10, 20, 40 μg/ml), with the inhibitory rate being (81.27 ± 3.25)% after 40 μg/ml NCTD treatment for 48 h. After HepG2 cells were treated with NCTD for 24 h, fuorescence microscopy revealed that the cell nuclei were condensed and fragmented, and agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA showed a typical DNA ladder map of apoptosis. Flow cytometry results showed that the apoptosis rates of HepG2 cells were (7.33 ± 0.25)%, (18.23 ± 1.19)%, (32.5 ± 2.30)%, and (48.23 ± 1.17)% after 5, 10, 20, and 40 μg/ml NCTD treatments, respectively. Western blotting analysis results demonstrated that the survivin expression in HepG2 cells was significantly down-regulated with the increase of NCTD dosage. Conclusion: NCTD can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells, which is related to the down-regulation of survivin protein.

0036141960	Polymorphisms at the TNF locus in Chinese Han population	One hundred sixty-four unrelated healthy individuals from Chinese Han population were investigated in order to define the distribution of eight polymorphic loci within the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene cluster and determine their relationship between the high polymorphic microsatellite TNFa, b, d, and other elements. The cloning and sequencing for five microsatellites were simultaneously done. In this study, the distribution of TNF alleles apparently vary from other ethnic groups. A new allele was detected and confirmed. It should be emphasized that a very strong association between TNFd8 and TNFe4 is reported and d8e4 haplotype appears to be specific to the population studied. In addition, five extended haplotypes were established in this population: a665c1d8e4TNF308-1TNF-βNco1-1TNFAspH1-2, a2b1c2d5e1TNF308-1TNF-βNco1-2TNFAspH1-2, a11b4c1d4e3TNF308-1TNF-βNco1-2TNFAspH1-1, a10b4c1d4e3TNF308-1TNF-βNco1-2TNFAspH1-1, and a2b3c1d2e3TNF308-2TNFAspH1-2. Data suggest that important ethnic differences may exist and that it is a necessary initiative for further research. © American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics, 2002.

0036268507	Significance of nuclear factor-κB, cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in human ulcerative colitis tissues	AIM: The induction of transcription factor NF-κB modulates the expression of multiple genes in immunal and inflammatory reations Ulcerative colitis (UC) exists abnormal activation of epithelial cells, lymphocytes and macrophages and uncontrolled cytokine production. The authors examined the expression and distribution of NF-κB, p65, COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), of the latter two having NF-κB binding sites in their promoters, to investigate the significance of them in the pathogenesis of UC and the relationship between them. METHODS: The expression of NF-κBp65, COX-2 and iNOS was examined in 69 cases of paraffin-embedded tissues by immunohistochemical methods. Of the 69 cases, 39 were from endoscopic biopsies of active UC and 30 were normal controls. RESULTS: P65, COX-2 and iNOS were expressed in all the UC tissues, mainly in epithelial cells, and also inflammatory cells in lamina propria and vascular endothelial cells in variant degrees. They all were expressed negatively or weakly in controls. Their expression was significantly higher in UC tissues than that in controls (P < 0. 01). The expression of p65 was related to endoscopic and pathologic classification. It was significantly higher in endoscopic class II than that in class I (5.8 ± 2.6 vs 3.6 ± 1.9, P < 0.05) and was significantly higher in pathologic class II and III than that in class I (6.1 ± 2.4, 7.3 ± 2.5 vs 4.0 ± 2.3; P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). The expression of iNOS was related to pathologic classification. It was significantly higher in pathologic class III than that in class I and II (7.8 ± 2.5 vs 4, 6 =2.3, 5.0 ± 1.6, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). The expression of COX-2 did not relate to endoscopic or pathologic classification, or disease severity. The expression of p65 significantly correlated with that of COX-2 and iNOS (r

0036308090	Correlation between expression of hypoxia-factor-1αmRNA and angiogenesis in gastric adenocarcinoma	AIM: To investigate the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α(HIF-1α) mRNA and vascular endothelial cell growth factor(VEGF) in gastric adenocarcinoma and its relation with the microvessel density (MVD), and to analyze their the significance in clinical research. METHODS: Expression of HIF-1mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization, and the expression of VEGF protein and microvessel density was studied by immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: In gastric adenocarcinoma, HIF-1αmRNA and VEGF positive cells and the level of microvessel density were significantly increased, compared with those in the normal issues (76.7 % vs 20 %, 66.7 % vs 0 %, 34 ± 10 vs 15 ± 5, respectively) (P < 0.01). Moreover, the level of MVD seemed to be closely related with the pathologic type (P < 0.01), but not with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. The expression of VEGF was associated with the TNM stage and distant metastasis at some extent(P < 0.05), but no relation to the pathologic type. And the expression of HIF-1αmRNA was positively correlated with both MVD level (r = 0.37, P < 0.05) and the VEGF expression (r = 0.42, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of HIF-1αmRNA is significantly associated with the angiogenesis in gastric adenocarcinoma. The mechanism may be that the elevated level of HIF-1α induces the tumor angiogenesis by activating the transcription of VEGF gene, but it is not the only way that HIF-1αinfluences angiogenesis in the tumor.

79959348366	Norcantharidin (NCTD) induces mitochondria mediated apoptosis in human HepG2 cells	Norcantharidin (NCTD), a demethylated form of cantharidin, is now in used as a routine anticancer drug. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process are generally unclear. The aims of this study were to evaluate the apoptotic effects and molecular mechanisms of NCTD. MTT assay was used to determine the cell growth inhibitory rate. Flow cytometry were used to detect the apoptosis and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) induced by NCTD. Caspase detection kit were used to detect the activity of caspase-3 -9. Western-blot was used to detect the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and cytochrome C (cyt C). Our results indicated that, treatment of NCTD resulted in significant decrease in cell viability in a dose-and time-dependent manner. A dose-dependent apoptosis was also observed by flow cytometery analysis. Molecular mechanistic studies of apoptosis revealed that, NCTD treatment resulted in a significant loss of Δψm, release of cyt C, enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and suppression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These were followed by activation of caspases-9 and -3, subsequently leading to cell apoptosis. These results indicate that, NCTD induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells by apoptosis, which is mediated through mitochondrial pathway. © 2011 Academic Journals.

79960540890	Application of 16S rRNA-based polymerase Chain reaction in the evaluation of the probiotics treatment (VSL#3) on TNBS-induced colitis through modulation of gut flora in rats	Objective: To investigate the effect of probiotics VSL#3 on the gut bacteria of TNBS-induced colitis rat models by PCR using 16S rDNA primers, and to determine whether VSL#3 has anti-colitis effects through modulating gut flora or not. Methods: Trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis models were established in 24 Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were randomly divided into three groups as model group, VSL#3 group, and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) group according to the treatment. Rats' behaviors, body weight, and feces changes were recorded. Seven days after modeling, all rats were sacrificed, colon and feces samples were collected for HE staining and gut flora determination. PCR using 16S rDNA primers was adopted to assay the relative amount of bacterial 16S rDNA gene PCR products, and the results were compared with those of bacterial counting by conventional culturing methods. Results: All rats showed colitis features such as body loss, abdominal distension, diarrhea, and blood stool. Pathologic changes were severer in model group than in VSL#3 and 5-ASA groups, which includes inflammatory cell infiltration, destruction of crypt structures, and ulcer or erosion of the mucosa. Both PCR and bacterial counting results showed that both Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria population were higher, while E. coli strains were less in VSL#3 group than in the other groups. Conclusion: VSL#3 could alleviate the TNBS-induce colitis through balancing the gut flora of TNBS-induced colitis rats. PCR using 16S rDNA primers can be adopted to determine the amount of gut bacteria accurately and specifically.

79960494438	Analysis of 462 young patients with primary malignant tumors in stomach	Objective: To investigate the characteristics of clinicopathology and the methods of diagnosis and treatment of primary malignant tumors in stomach of young patients. Methods: The clinical and pathological features of 462 young patients with primary malignant tumors in stomach were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Most (85.0%) of the 462 cases were gastric carcinoma. The gastric carcinoma of young patients had the pathologic features such as poor differentiation, early infiltration and metastasis, more originating from the distal part of stomach, and more foci involved (versus that of the elderly). The coincidence rates of endoscopic ultrasonography and ultrasonograpgy combined with gastroscopy in diagnosing gastric carcinoma in youth were 100% and 94.2% respectively, and both were higher than those of conventional gastroscopy and biopsy (71.8%). The 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates of radical resection cases were 54.3%, 31.5% and 19.7% respectively, and were higher than those of palliative operation ones (27.3%, 10.4%, and 0, respectively); the 5-year survival rate of 27 early-stage cases with radical resection reached 100%. Most of the young cases of primary gastric lymphoma were diagnozed in the middle and late stages. Seven of the 11 cases with radical resection combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy survived after a 5-year follow-up. Conclusion: The differentiation and prognosis of primary gastric malignant tumors in youth are poor, and the metastases happen early. Early diagnosis and early radical resection is important to improve survival rate. The conventional gastroscopy is major method in diagnosing gastric malignant tumors, but endoscopic ultrasonography and ultrasonography combined with gastroscopy may elevate the coincidence rate of diagnosis.

84863254668	Meta-analysis: Total parenteral nutrition versus total enteral nutrition in predicted severe acute pancreatitis	Background Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as a traditional mode of treatment in severe acute pancreatitis was still used widely in clinical work. In addition, enteral nutrition treatment methods have developed; early enteral nutrition has already been highlighted for severe acute pancreatitis, but the therapeutic risks versus benefits need to be studied. Aims and Objective To compare total parenteral nutrition with total enteral nutrition (TEN) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis by performing a meta-analysis. Materials and Methods Electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, were searched to find relevant randomized controlled trials. Two reviewers independently identified relevant trials evaluating the effect of total parenteral nutrition and early enteral nutrion. Outcome measures were the mortality, hospital length of stay, infectious complications, duration of nutrition, organ failure and surgical intervention. Results Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 381 patients were identified. Meta-analysis demonstrated that TEN was significantly superior to TPN when considering mortality [p=0.001, 95%CI 0.37 (0.21-0.68)], infectious complications [p=0.004, 95%CI 0.46(0.27-0.78)], organ failure [p=0.02, 95%CI 0.44 (0.22-0.88)] and surgical intervention [p=0.003, 95%CI 0.41(0.23-0.74)].While no difference between TEN and TPN when considering the hospital length of stay [p=0.22, 95%CI -14.10(-36.48-8.26)] and as for duration of nutrition [p=0.72, 95%CI -1.50(-9.56-6.56)] there was not enough data to compare the differences. Conclusion Total enteral nutritional support is associated with lower mortality, fewer infectious complications, decreased organ failure and surgical intervention rate compared to parenteral nutritional support. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

84865453565	TLR4 signaling promotes immune escape of human colon cancer cells by inducing immunosuppressive cytokines and apoptosis resistance	This study investigated the expression and biological role of TLR4 in human colon cancer cells' growth and survival, and its potential as a target for colon cancer therapy. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to detect the expression level of TLR4. MTT analysis was performed to evaluate cell proliferation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to test the production of IL-8, VEGF, and TGF-β. MAPKs and NF-κB were analyzed by Western blotting. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. The results showed that the human colon cancer cells HT-29, SW480, and Lovo all expressed TLR4 at both mRNA and protein levels, and TLR4 ligand LPS could not affect the expression of TLR4 and the proliferation of colon cancer cells. LPS increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 and activated NF-κB. LPS promoted cytokine production, such as IL-8, VEGF, and TGF-β. In addition, LPS induced resistance of human colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and NF-κB activation was necessary for apoptosis resistance. The study identified the expression level of TLR4 in human colon cancer cells and TLR4 was functionally active. TLR4 may play important roles in promoting immune escape of human colon cancer cells by inducing immunosuppressive factors and apoptosis resistance. Copyright © 2012 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

METHODS: The expression of iNOS in 50 patients with gastric cancer was studied by immunohistochemical SP method with anti-iNOS. Microvessel density (MVD) of human gastric cancer was also determined with anti-CD34 as the labels. RESULTS: The expression rate of iNOS in 50 cases was 70 %, and the rates of node negative and node positive in gastric cancer were 54.2 % and 84.6 %, respectively, with significant difference (P <0.01). There was a significant difference of MVD (P <0.01) among groups with different expression of iNOS. CONCLUSION: The expression rate of iNOS in human gastric cancer is high, and it is closely related to the carcinoangiogenesis and metastasis.

0036897484	Topographic association of gastric epithelial expression of Ki-67, Bax, and Bcl-2 with antralization in the gastric incisura, body, and fundus	OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection seems to induce antralization (i.e., gastric mucosal transformation from transitional or body type to antral type), which is strongly associated with gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. The aim of this study was to determine the topographic associations of Ki-67 (a protein expressed in proliferative cells), Bax (a pro-apoptotic protein), and Bcl-2 (an antiapoptotic protein) expression with antralization. METHODS: In each of 104 patients, eight biopsy specimens were taken from the gastric antrum, incisura, body, and fundus for the determination of H. pylori infection, histological changes, and epithelial expression of Ki-67, Bax, and Bcl-2. A labeling index (LI), i.e., the rate of positive cells over total cells counted, was used for Ki-67 and Bax expression. Bcl-2 overexpression was considered to be present if the rate of Bcl-2 positive cells over total cells counted was ≥5%. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was present at the gastric antrum, incisura, body, and fundus in 50, 48, 51, and 49 patients, respectively. Ki-67 LI was greater in the presence (vs absence) of H. pylori infection at the antrum (51 vs 40), incisura (47 vs 36), body (43 vs 30), and fundus (41 vs 31) (all p < 0.001). At the incisura, Ki-67 LI was greater (47 vs 32, p < 0.001), Bax LI was lower (22 vs 30, p < 0.05), and prevalence of Bcl-2 overexpression was higher (44% vs 18%, p < 0.001) in the presence (vs absence) of antralization. Compared with normal mucosa, gastric atrophy/intestinal metaplasia were associated with an increased Ki-67 LI and decreased Bax LI at the antrum (49 vs 32 and 15 vs 23, respectively), incisura (47 vs 32 and 15 vs 26, respectively) (all p < 0.001). Bcl-2 overexpression was more frequent in gastric atrophy/intestinal metaplasia at the antrum (56% vs 11%, p < 0.001) and incisura (63% vs 19%, p < 0.001) compared with normal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Antralization at the incisura is topographically associated with increased cell proliferation, reduced Bax expression, and Bcl-2 overexpression, which implies that antralization may be an important histological marker for future cancer risk. © 2002 by Am.

RESULTS: Survivin expression was observed in 36 of 60 (60.0%) cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma and in 6 of 35 (17.1%) cases of adenoma. In contrast, normal colonic mucosa did not express survivin. Overexpression of survivin was related to the differentiation grade of colorectal adenocarcinoma, however there was no correlation with Dukes's stage of lymph node metastasis. Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was higher in colorectal adenocarcinoma than that in adenoma (39.1 ± 10.4% versus 22.3 ± 6.2%, P<0.01). The apoptosis index (AI) of colorectal adenocarcinoma and"adenoma was significantly higher than that of normal tissues (P<0.01). More apoptotic cells were noticed in well and moderate differentiated adenocarcinoma than those in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (P<0.05). Survivin positive adenoma and adenocarcinoma had significantly lower values for AI than survivin negative tumors (P<0.01), and the Ki-67 LI in survivin positive adenoma and adenocarcinoma were higher than that in survivin negative tumors (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of survivin expression in adenocarcinoma suggests that survivin may play an important role in human colorectal tumorigenesis through the inhibition of apoptosis and acceleration of proliferative activity. Survivin may be a new prognostic implication in colorectal adenocarcinoma and serve as a widely applicable target for anticancer gene therapy.

0037713736	Role of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in aberrant crypt foci-adenoma-carcinoma sequence	Aim: To investigate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in aberrant crypt foci (ACF)-adenoma-carcinoma sequence and its relation with tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis. Methods: The expression of iNOS, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and microvessel density (MVD) in different stages of colorectal cancer were studied by immunohistochemical method from 30 normal tissues, 30 nonhyperplastic ACF, 30 hyperplastic ACF, 30 dysplastic ACF, 30 adenomas and 60 carcinomas. The apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method using an Apop Tag in situ detection kit. Results: The immunoreactivity of iNOS significantly increased in the transition from hyperplastic ACF to dysplastic ACF. This transition was associated with a significant decrease in the apoptotic index (AI) (0.73±0.37 vs 0.61±0.35, P<0.05) and significant increases in the PCNA labeling index (LI) (27.3±2.80 vs 40.3±3.11, P<0.01) and microvessel density (MVD) (55±11.5 vs 70±13.2, P<0.01). The expression of iNOS was in low levels and positively correlated with PCNA-LI (r=0.812, P<0.01) and MVD (r=0.863, P<0.01) during transition from normal mucosa to nonhyperplastic ACF and hyperplastic ACF. The expression of iNOS was in high levels and positively correlated with AI (r=0.901, P<0.01) after transition from hyperplastic ACF to dysplastic ACF, adenoma and carcinoma. Conclusion: The results suggest that the transition from hyperplastic ACF to dysplastic ACF may be a crucial step in the ACF-adenoma-carcinoma sequence, in which iNOS plays an important role by regulating tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis.

0037713740	Synergistic antitumor effect of TRAIL and doxorubicin on colon cancer cell line SW480	Aim: TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) has been reported to specifically induce apoptosis of cancer cells although only a small percentage of cell lines were sensitive to it. Cell lines not responding to TRAIL in vitro were said to be more prone to apoptosis when TRAIL was combined with another anticancer agent. Generally, factors affecting drug-sensitivity involve many apoptosis-related proteins, including p53. The expression of wild-type p53 gene was proposed as an important premise for tumor cells responding to chemotherapy. The present study was to investigate the cell killing action of TRAIL on colon cancer cell line SW480, its synergistic effect with doxorubicin, and the possible mechanisms. Methods: SW480 cells were cultured in the regular condition and incubated with different levels of agents. Morphologic changes in these cells after treatment were observed under phase-contrast microscope and cytotoxicity by TRAIL alone and in combination with doxorubicin was quantified by a 1-day microculture tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay. In addition, flow cytometry assay (FCM) and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect apoptosis among these cells. Variation of p53 protein level among different groups according to concentrations of agents was measured by Western blot assay. Results: (1) SW480 cells were not sensitive to TRAIL, with IC

84880433393	Effects of matrine on the proliferation of HT29 human colon cancer cells and its antitumor mechanism	Matrine is one of the main active components that is extracted from the dry roots of Sophora flavescens. The compound has potent antitumor activity in various cancer cell lines. However, the anticancer activity of matrine in colon cancer cells remains unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of matrine on the growth of human colon cancer cells and the expression of the associated proteins. Cancer cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The activation of the caspases and the expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors were examined using western blot analysis. Matrine was shown to significantly inhibit the proliferation of HT29 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and also to reduce the percentage of cells in the G

84881018761	Therapeutic effects of muscovite on ulcerative colitis in rats	Objective: To explore the efficacy of muscovite on iodoacetamide-induced ulcerative colitis in rats and elucidate its possible mechanism. Methods: Ulcerative colitis was induced in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by an intracolonic injection of iodoacetamide. A total of 48 rats were divided randomly (by the method of random digits table) into 6 groups; control group, model group, low-dose muscovite group (360 mg/kg), high-dose muscovite group (720 mg/kg), 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) group and muscovite plus 5-ASA group (combined treatment), and each group had 8 rats. The body weight, disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic damage and microscopic score of rats in each group were subsequently evaluated after dosing for 7 days. The protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) while the activity of nuclear facor(NF)-κB was determined by immunohistochemistry. One way ANOVA and rank-sum test were used. Results: After doing, body weight macroscopic damage, microscopic score, TNF-α concentration, MPO and NF-κB activity of rats in each group were all significantly correlated with the dose of muscovite (r = 0.573, -0.647, -0.569, -0.681, -0.811, -0.842, all P < 0.05). High-dose muscovite group had no significant difference with 5-ASA group in body weightt, DAI, macroscopic damage, microscopic score, IL-8 concentration, TNF-α concentration, MPO and NF-κB activities((166±5) vs (167 ± 5) g, 0.33 (0.00, 1.17) vs 0.17 (0.00, 0.83), 2.50 (2.00, 4.00) vs 3.00 (2.00, 3.00), 3.00 (2.00, 3.00) vs 2.50 (2.00, 3.00), (109 ± 17) vs (111 ± 15) pg/ml, (166 ± 38) vs (155 ± 45) pg/ml, (52 ± 6) vs (49 ± 4) U/g, 7.39±0.42 vs 7.41±0.34, all P > 0.05). The MPO and NF-κB activities of combined treatment group were lower than those of 5-ASA group ((40±4) vs (49 ± 4) U/g, 4.67±0.72 vs 7.41 ± 0.34, all P < 0.05). However, other indices showed no significant difference with 5-ASA group (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: Rectal administration of muscovite ameliorates colonic inflammation of iodoacetamide-induced colitis. Its underlying mechanism is probably due to the regulation of inflammatory response. Muscovite may be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of ulcerative colitis. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84884812077	Interaction between gene A-positive Helicobacter pylori and human leukocyte antigen II alleles increase the risk of Graves disease in Chinese Han population: An association study	Objective: The current study explored the correlation of Helicobacter pylori and the polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen II (HLA-II) alleles with Graves disease (GD). Methods: A total of 216 patients with GD were recruited. 102 healthy volunteers constituted the control group. Levels of H. pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and H. pylori cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG antibodies were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Molecular typing of the HLA-II alleles was conducted using polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers. Results: H. pylori, particularly CagA-positive strains, HLA-DQA1 0201, and HLA-DQA1 0501 were associated with GD (P= 0.015, OR = 1.811; P = 0.000, OR = 3.085; P = 0.000, OR = 0.315; and P = 0.004, OR = 2.844, respectively). Patients with CagA-positive H. pylori and negative HLA-DQA1 0201 or positive HLA-DQA1 0501 were more likely exposed to GD compared with those with only one of these indices. Conclusion: CagA-positive H. pylori, negative HLA-DQA1 0201, or positive HLA-DQA1 0501 may increase the risk of GD. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

0042931260	Expression and significance of thymidine phosphorylase/platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor in human colorectal cancer tissue	AIM: To study the relationship between thymidine phosphorylase(TP)/platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor(PD-ECGF), microvessel density (MVD) and the clinical pathological characteristics of colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: TP/PD-ECGF protein expression and microvessel density (MVD) in 50 colorectal carcinomas were examined by means of immunohistochemical staining S-P method and the relationship of TP/PD-ECGF, MVD and clinical pathological characteristics and its prognosis of colorectal cancers were analysed. RESULTS: MVD and TP/PD-ECGF expression positively correlated with the size of the tumour, Dukes stage, lymph node metastasis and depth of invasion (P<0.01), but no significant correlation with the histologic type (P>0.05) was found. There was a positive correlation between MVD and TP/PD-ECGF expression (r=0.72). CONCLUSION: TP/PD-ECGF is highly related to angiogenesis of colorectal carcinoma and promotes invasion and metastasis. TP/PD-ECGF expression or MVD may be one of the predictors of the biological behaviors of colorectal carcinoma, and they may serve as prognostic factors and guide the treatment.

84888206523	Roles of lipoxin A4 in preventing paracetamol-induced acute hepatic injury in a rabbit model	The objective of this research is to investigate the potential role of lipoxin A4 in preventing paracetamol (PCM)-induced hepatic injury. One hundred male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into control group, PCM group, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) group, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) group, and LXA4 + NAC group. The rabbits were assigned to receive 300 mg/kg weight PCM in 0.9 % saline or equivalent volume of saline via gastric lavage. LXA4 (1.5 μg/kg) and equivalent volume of 2 % ethanol were separately given to the rabbits in LXA4-treated and PCM groups 24 h after PCM administration. Meanwhile, the rabbits in the NAC-treated groups received a loading dose of 140 mg/kg of N-acetylcysteine. The blood samples and liver tissue were collected for biochemical and histological evaluation 36 h after paracetamol administration. The administration of LXA4 24 h after paracetamol poisoning resulted in significant improvement in hepatic injury as represented by decrease of hepatocellular enzyme release and attenuation of hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis. In LXA4-treated groups, the expression of TNF-α was significantly lower than those in PCM and NAC groups (p < 0.05). In contrast, the level of IL-10 was significantly higher than PCM and NAC groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expressions of NF-κB p65 in PCM and NAC groups were significantly increased compared with those of LXA4-treated groups and control group (respectively, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). LXA4-treated groups also showed significantly higher survival rates. Lipoxin A4 significantly mitigates paracetamol-induced hepatic injury, in which anti-inflammation effect may play an important role, leading to hepatic apoptosis and necrosis. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84903310116	CCL25/CCR9 interactions regulate the function of iNKT cells in oxazolone-induced colitis in mice	Background: Natural killer T (NKT) cells share phenotypic and functional properties with both conventional natural killer cells and T cells. These cells might have an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). The interaction of chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25) with chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is involved in gut-specific migration of leukocytes and induces regulatory T cells (Tregs) to migrate to the intestine in chronic ileitis. Methodology/Findings: In UC patients, NKT receptor CD161, CCL25, and CCR9 expression levels were evaluated by qRTPCR. A murine model of oxazolone-induced colitis was induced in BALB/c mice. The mRNA levels of NK1.1, CCL25 and CCR9, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice were evaluated. The CCR9 expression on Type I or invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, and the iNKT cells chemotaxis are observed according to flow cytometry. NKT receptor CD161, CCL25 and CCR9 expression levels were significantly increased in UC patients. And, the mRNA expression levels of NK1.1, CCL25 and CCR9 were increased in oxazolone-induced colitis in mice. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly increased, especially interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-10 and IL-13. We observed significantly increased CCR9 expression on iNKT cells. Furthermore, we found an increased iNKT population and enhanced chemotaxis during oxazolone-induced colitis. Conclusions/ Significance: Our study suggests that CCL25/CCR9 interactions may promote the induction and function of iNKT cells during oxazolone-induced colitis. These findings may have important implications for UC treatment and suggest a role for CCR9 inhibitors. © 2014 Zhu et al.

84910002265	Accuracy of early detection of colorectal tumours by stool methylation markers: A meta-analysis	AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of methylation of genes in stool samples for diagnosing colorectal tumours. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese Journals Full-Text Database and Wanfang Journals Full-Text Database were searched to find relevant original articles about methylated genes to be used in diagnosing colorectal tumours. A quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool (QADAS) was used to evaluate the quality of the included articles, and the Meta-disc 1.4 and SPSS 13.0 software programs were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria, and 4484 patients were included. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) were 73% (95%CI: 71%-75%) and 92% (95%CI: 90%-93%), respectively. For adenoma, the sensitivity and specificity were 51% (95%CI: 47%-54%) and 92% (95%CI: 90%-93%), respectively. Pooled diagnostic performance of SFRP2 methylation for CRC provided the following results: the sensitivity was 79% (95%CI: 75%-82%), the specificity was 93% (95%CI: 90%-96%), the diagnostic OR was 47.57 (95%CI: 20.08-112.72), the area under the curve was 0.9565. Additionally, the results of accuracy of SFRP2 methylation for detecting colorectal adenomas were as follows: sensitivity was 43% (95%CI: 38%-49%), specificity was 94% (95%CI: 91%-97%), the diagnostic OR was 11.06 (95%CI: 5.77-21.18), and the area under the curve was 0.9563. CONCLUSION: Stool-based DNA testing may be useful for noninvasively diagnosing colorectal tumours and SFRP2 methylation is a promising marker that has great potential in early CRC diagnosis.
