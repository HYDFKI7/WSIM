20144363334	Numerical investigation of supersonic jet interactions for tactical bodies	In order to investigation of the jet interaction for finned bodies, the interaction between a lateral jet and the supersonic external flow was investigated numerically by solving the N-S equation. To model more exactly the nozzle geometry and resolve the complex flow associated with the lateral jet problem, the multi-block point matched grid generation technique and O type grid technique were applied. The detailed numerical simulation for a variety of missile geometries in the supersonic flow was performed. These include nonfinned axisymmetrical bodies and finned bodies with either strakes or aft-mounted tail fins. The computations were performed at Mach numbers 2 and 4.5. The computational results show significant interactions of the jet induced flowfield with the fin surfaces that produce additional effects compared with the body alone. The computational results were compared with the experimental results from a previously published wind-tunnel study that consisted primarily of global force and moment measurements. The numerical calculations show good agreement with the experimental investigation at supersonic Mach numbers.

20144377953	Investigation and enhancement of cut-paste algorithm in overlapping grid	To solve the problem in generation of overlapping grids in CFD (computational fluid dynamics) automatically, the main characteristics and basic flow of the newly emerged cut-paste algorithm which generates overlapping grids by cutting and pasting hole fronts were investigated. The promising advantages of this algorithm were introduced, yet two main disadvantages were putted forth. In the conventional algorithm, one may gets failed in the judgement of attributes of hole-mapping cells when walls are not closed totally. It is a big obstacle to implement of this algorithm in many applications. The undesired orphan cells may occur when hole boundaries expand out during the cut phase. Enhancements were made on these aspects to improve this algorithm. The new attribute judgement method for hole-mapping cells was considered and an additive step after cut phase was employed. These improvements were found to be effective, and the modified algorithm was extended to the application of self-adapted grid and DRAGON grid generation. Several complicated examples were also included to demonstrate that this algorithm becomes more stable, more automatic, and also more suitable in large applications.

Fully turbulent solution was adopted, by using baldwin-lomax (BL) model. The computed load hysteresis loops indicate good agreement with the experiment results, which confirms that the numerical method is effective. Through comparing and analyzing different flow fields, it is simultaneously founded that the formation and development of stall vortex passing airfoil is obvious distinct for different-thickness airfoils during light stall and deep stall.

Comprehensive comparisons between numerical results and experimental data reveal that the AUSM + scheme has better resolutions in heat computations. In addition, the numerical stimulation of surface heat flux is highly sensitive to the grid system employed in the CFD computations.

33745750394	Adaptive local time step method for DSMC code	Theoretic analysis reveals that, ALTS (adaptive local time step) method offered by Laux, although greatly reducing the execution CPU time needed for the flow to reach to a steady state and thus leading to high simulation efficiency of DSMC (direct simulation of Monte Carlo) method codes, has some drawbacks in complicating molecules' moving and collision calculations and in requiring additional RAM. Modifications were made to time intervals at which molecular moving and collision are computed, and to the collision sampling method. These modifications simplified molecules' moving and collision computation, and also avoid the consumption of unnecessary RAM. The modified ALTS method was adopted in the DSMC code. Simulations of rarefied gas flow over a cylinder were performed with and without this modified ALTS method, and the result shows that these modifications result in a significant reduction in the execution CPU time, but introduce little difference on the simulation resolution and the flow structure.

The numerical technique of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was applied to calculate the steady flow around the swimmer's hand and forearm in two different hand-figures at various speeds when angle of attack was 90°. The drags, lifts and corresponding coefficients were computed for the hand and forearm, and the flow fields around the hand and forearm were analyzed based on the calculated data, which showed the influence of hand-figures on swimming propulsive efficiency. The results show that the forces caused by pressure difference are the major part of the propulsive forces, swimming with fingers holding together provides higher propulsive efficiency than swimming with fingers splaying when the angle of attack is 90°.

33846919649	Numerical study of aeroheating predictions for hypersonic reentry bodies	In order to calculate the heating rates on hypersonic blunt bodies quickly and effectively, two engineering methods were developed based upon the axisymmetric analogue which required tracking the inviscid surface streamlines. Engineering predictions in the boundary layer were used in both methods. However, method No.1 used engineering predictions out of the boundary layer, and in method No.2 the boundary-layer edge conditions were determined by the CFD method solved by Euler equations of three dimensions. Results of the two methods are in good agreement with the existing experimental data, which validates the correctness of the methods in calculating the heating rates on hypersonic vehicles. Results of these two engineering methods were also compared with those of CFD method solved by N-S equations, which indicates that the engineering methods save much calculating time and also have precision on predicting the heating rates on windward.

To validate the new method, a simple model of super-maneuvering was numerically simulated with the improved Dual-Euler method, and R-K algorithm with variant time steps was used for time integration.

For solving the N-S equations, 4 advanced upwind schemes, 14 different grid distributions and 5 limiters were employed. All the results were compared with Blasius solution. The results show that the van Lee's FVS(flux vector splitting) scheme has considerable numerical dissipation, it is also sensitive to grid quality and limiter, so it is unsuitable for friction calculation. The solution is more accurate with a higher limiter and scheme viscous resolution. The calculation precision strongly depends on the height of the first level mesh. Considering both of the calculation ability and the grid aspect ratio, the height of the first level grid can be reduced to improve precision. For skin friction calculation, there must be no less than 4 grid points in the boundary layer.

34547410829	An SOR implicit time-accurate scheme in calculating unsteady flows	A new time-accurate marching scheme for unsteady flow calculations is proposed in the present work. This method is the combination of classical Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) iteration method and Jacobian matrix diagonally dominant splitting method of LUSGS. One advantage of this algorithm is the second-order accuracy because of no factorization error. Another advantage is the low computational cost because the Jacobian matrices and fluxes are only calculated once in each physical time step. And, the SOR algorithm has better convergence property than Gauss-Seidel. To investigate its accuracy and convergency, several unsteady flow computational tests are carried out by using the proposed SOR algorithm. Roe's FDS scheme is used to discritize the inviscid flux terms. Unsteady computational results of SOR are compared with the experiment results and those of Gauss-Seidel. Results reveal that the numerical results agree well with the experimental data and the second-order accuracy can be obtained as the Gauss-Seidel for unsteady flow computations. The impact of SOR factor is investigated for unsteady computations by using different SOR factors in this algorithm to simulate each computational test. Different numbers of inner iterations are needed to converge to the same criterion for different SOR factors and optimal choice of SOR factor can improve the computational efficiency greatly.

36249026355	Numerical simulation to effects of trailing edge jet on delta wing vortices	In order to study the influence of trailing edge symmetrical jet on leading edge vortex breakdown location and flow structure over a delta wing, vortex flows over a 60° swept delta wing with trailing symmetrical edge jet and without trailing edge jet were studied using high precise simulation of N-S equations. The results show that the ratio of jet velocity to free flow velocity affects the location of vortex breakdown. Compared with the condition without jet, the variation of the ratio of jet velocity to free flow velocity determines vortex breakdown location advance or delay. The difference from the traditional opinion is that not every case with trailing edge jet could delay the location of vortex breakdown. In addition, the trailing edge symmetrical jet has little influence on the position of the vortex axis. The trailing edge jet does not change the rule of topological structure transformation of the cross section, but it impacts the velocity of limit ring spread.

The Numerical results show good agreement with the experiments. It is indicated that the opposing jet is effective in reducing the aerodynamic heating and drag coefficient. Conclusions were got that the opposing jet enlarges the factors of affections by influencing the strength and the positions of the barrel shock, the mach disk and the recirculation region. It is believed that the drag coefficient turns out to be very sensitive to the flow field's structure which is highly depended on the free mach number, jet mach number and attack angle due to the opposing jet.

To investigate its accuracy and convergency, two computational tests of inviscid flows around NACA0012 airfoil in forced pitching up and down are made. In all computations, Roe's FDS scheme is used to discritize inviscid flux terms. Computational results reveal that the proposed method has normal second order accuracy which matches the accuracy of fully converged dual-time LUSGS scheme result. And, computational result comparison of different number of subiterations shows that the accuracy of the proposed scheme doesn't depend on the number of subiterations.

77954103347	New conception of aerothermal protection for hypersonic vehicles	High speed vehicles are designed to withstand severe aerodynamic heating conditions. Such vehicles include hypersonic projectiles, reentry payload module and hypersonic aircraft. Maximum heating and the consequent possibility for material erosion are typical problems associated in the nose region of the blunt body. The blunt nose shape also leads to very high aerodynamic drag accompanied by high structural pressure loadings, which exhibit significant effects in the final performance of the vehicle. So, there will be a trade-off study between thermal protection system and high wave drag associated with shock wave formation on such high speed vehicles. Waverider is favorable configuration for hypersonic aircrafts in terms of the high lift-to-drag ratio and integration design facility. However, their sharp leading edge brings severe aero-heating problem, which seriously hinders them from practical applications. Current literatures about aerothermal protection for waveriders mainly focus on the leading edge blunting. However, these researches are all motivated by aerothermal consideration, and the requirements of high lift-to-drag ratio greatly limits the bluntness of the leading edge, thus the effectiveness in aeroheating protection. In other words, the blunting of waverider's leading edges seems a theoretically possible way to relieve aeroheating. Under this background, the "artificially blunted leading edge (ABLE)" concept is first introduced into the waverider design in the present paper, expected to preserve a relatively sharp leading edge on the aerodynamic aspect, while showing virtual blunt leading edge on the aerothermal aspect, so as to find a new and effective way for waverider aerothermal protection. After a comprehensive formal parameter definition of the ABLE waverider, the influences of the parameters on the aerodynamic and aerothermal characteristics are investigated by means of the CFD numerical simulation. Basing on the flow analysis, with a circuitous process, feasible two-dimensional ABLE waverider configurations are finally obtained, and the rules and disciplines of the aerothermal protection method for waveriders using the ABLE concept are concluded. The results show that, if designed properly, the maximum heat transfer rate can be reduced by 60% or so, with a lift-to-drag ratio loss of no more than 19%, compared to the corresponding normal waverider configuration. Furthermore, the effectiveness is believed to be better with integral optimization of the ABLE formal parameters.

77954356785	Improvement of hole-surface optimization technique in overset grids and its application	The traditional cut-paste algorithm is usually unsuccessful in solving the assembly of an overset grid system between slit walls. In order to resolve this problem, two improved methods, the vertex method and the volume method, are presented in this article. The vertex method is based upon the grid cell vertex state and the volume method upon the grid cell size. The two methods change the two-step searching methods of cut and paste to a single step searching method to optimize the hole-surface. The results of the three example cases show that the two improved methods can solve the above problem successfully and they are able to transmit field data between the overset regions correctly. Furthermore, the computational results agree well with the experimental data, the optimization efficiency is higher and the rate of convergence is faster than the cut-paste method. The volume method, compared with the vertex method, can reduce the numerical error caused by the mismatch of grid sizes in the overset grid system, and obtain a better result and accuracy.

80052223460	A high resolution low dissipation hybrid scheme for compressible flows	In this paper, an efficient hybrid shock capturing scheme is proposed to obtain accurate results both in the smooth region and around discontinuities for compressible flows. The hybrid algorithm is based on a fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme in the finite volume form to solve the smooth part of the flow field, which is coupled with a characteristic-based monotone upstream-centered scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL) to capture discontinuities. The hybrid scheme is intended to combine high resolution of MUSCL scheme and low dissipation of WENO scheme. The two ingredients in this hybrid scheme are switched with an indicator. Three typical indicators are chosen and compared. MUSCL and WENO are both shock capturing schemes making the choice of the indicator parameter less crucial. Several test cases are carried out to investigate hybrid scheme with different indicators in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the hybrid scheme in the present work performs well in a broad range of problems. © 2011 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics All rights reserved.

Wall surface was allowed to terminate on truncation surface of grids, which would efficiently reduce the area of hole mapping and save the storage. Methods of hole mapping cell identification suitable for the generalized closure were analyzed, showing the unreliability of using wall surface information to identify the property of hole mapping cell. A new method named Inverse mark was developed which is especially suitable to the generalized closure. Mesh nodes' information was used to automatically identify out points, which are initial points to advance inside of the grid region. Results show that Inverse mark is of great efficiency, good reliability, and high automation, and can effectively enhance the flexibility of chimera grids to local complex configurations such as slits.

The objective of this present work is not to investigate the physical phenomena of the flow in detail but to study modeling as well as numerical aspects which influence the quality of DES solutions. Firstly, four typical spanwise lengths (D, 2D, πD/2 and πD, D the diameter of the cylinder) are chosen and the results are systematically compared. The trend of DES results along the span increment is different from previous large-eddy simulation (LES) investigation. DES method is more sensitive to the spanwise length and a wider spanwise length does not necessary improve the results. Then, the factor of mesh resolution is studied. Three kinds of grids, namely coarse, medium and refined, are adopted and the results show that both too coarse and over refined grids will deteriorate the performance of DES. The reason lies in the construction of DES employing the function of the distance to walls and grid spacing. Finally, different orders of numerical schemes are applied in the inviscid fluxes and the viscous terms. The discrepancies among different schemes are found tiny. However, the instantaneous flow structures produced by 5

The results show that all sorts of spatial discretization schemes have a good discrimination of shock wave, however the discrimination of viscosity vary with the dissipation of schemes evidently. The least dissipative schemes give the best discrimination of viscosity; also the heat transfer extremum turns out to be very sensitive to the dissipation of schemes. Conclusions were got that the smaller the scheme dissipation, the larger the heat transfer extremum, and with its location near the frontal.

Moreover, for the under-expanded supersonic jets, the repetitively-generated quasi-steady shock cells in the jets indicate their stable development and the disappearance of these shock cells implies that the jets are about to fall into instable states.

65249129196	Entropy correction analyses for Roe scheme	Three types' entropy fix formulations for the Roe scheme were analyzed in theory and assessed by three numerical tests which were shock tube problem, step flow and double Mach reflection. The results show that "Carbuncle phenomena" occurs when capturing strong shock because of the original Roe scheme's numerical instability. Muller's and Harten-Yee's entropy fix methods introduce numerical dissipation to both shock and non-physical expansion shock processes. The numerical dissipation improves the Roe scheme's numerical stability and cures "Carbuncle phenomena" entirely for shock case and diffuses the expansion shock completely as well. Harten-Hyman type's entropy correction formulations do no contribution to shock case and can not cure the "Carbuncle phenomena". They can only fix non-physical expansion processes partially because their numerical dissipation is not large enough. The eigenvalue correction method which directly uses delta replace eigenvalue itself exceeds the traditional method.

It is applied to numerically simulating the viscous flow over airfoil NACA0012, hyper ballistic shape and basic finner missile in forced pitching movement at different initial angles of attack. Then the time history of dynamic aerodynamic force and moment coefficients is achieved and the static derivatives and dynamic derivatives of pitching are obtained by integral methods. By comparing the present computational results with the experimental data and computational data obtained through the engineering method, the dynamic nonlinear characteristics are analyzed of vehicles at high angles of attack.

0035342958	Numerical investigations of the effects of different leading edge profiles on the vortex flows over double-delta wings	The effects of different leading-edge profiles on the vortex flows over double delta wings were investigated both numerically and theoretically. The different mechanisms of the leading-edge profiles affecting the vortex flows over both single-delta-wings and double-delta-wings were analyzed and contrasted. While over single delta wings, the structures of the vortices resulting from sharp leading-edges are organized best, over double-delta-wings, the structures of the vortices resulting from sharp leading-edges are organized best, over double-delta-wings, the structures of the vortices resulting from round leading-edges are closer to the wing surface, and are tighter than those resulting from sharp leading-edges. This shows that, over double-delta-wings, round leading-edges have stronger inducement abilities, and can constitute more favorable vortices interactions, which makes it easier to transfer vorticity from the inner vortices to the outer vortices through the shear layers. Thus, the combined vortices become more stable, and the vortices breakdown can be well prolonged. Moreover, because they are closer to the wing surface, the vortices resulting from round leading-edges can provide a higher nonlinear lift than under other circumstances, which is different from the traditional views.

Three types of ideal waverider configurations with largest lift-to-drag and volume-to-length ratio are obtained based on this method at the given design condition. The optimization results indicate that, the common C-shape ideal waveriders generally provide the highest lift-to-drag ratio, while the M-shape configurations offer substantially larger volume-to-length ratio, allowing a 17%∼59% gain in volume with only a 1.8%∼3% decrease in lift-to-drag ratio, compared to the C-shape. And the Ω-shape is subtle to configuration parameters. However, when the leading edge is blunted, the Ω-shape suffers the least lift-to-drag degrading, thus becomes the type with highest lift-to-drag ratio among the three. Besides, given the center of gravity prescribed in this paper, the Ω-shape has the best stability both longitudinally and laterally. Finally, Different aerodynamic characteristics of the three types and their property changes after blunting, prove the necessity of keeping the optimal series in the optimization process, as well as provide information for waverider design projects.

In this paper, the "artificially blunted leading edge (ABLE)" concept is first imported to solve this problem, in order that, the aeroheating rate of the modified waverider with ABLE decreases while maintaining a still high Lift-to-drag ratio. A simplified two dimensional model is considered, followed by a comprehensive formal parameter definition. After inspecting each of the parameters' influences on the aerothermodynamic performances of the ABLE waveriders, combined with flow analysis and a circuitous marching process, an excellent ABLE waverider configuration is obtained, which shows that, if designed properly, the maximum heat transfer rate can be reduced by 60% or so, with a lift-to-drag ratio loss of no more than 19%, compared to corresponding normal waverider configuration. And the effectiveness is believed to be better with integral optimization of the ABLE formal parameters. Copyright © 2009 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

78650808346	Enhancement and application of overset grid assembly	In this article, the overset grid assembly method is improved to efficiently solve several critical problems that occur when applying overset grids to the complicated geometries and moving body. First, instead of using the two-step searching (i.e. cut and paste), a single-step searching method based on the grid cell size is proposed to modify holes and optimize the grid overlapping automatically. Second, discrepancies between the wall surface representations, where the grids overlap, are handled by introducing the wall's normal directions to the hole-map and projecting the interpolated points on the recipient mesh into the donor mesh. Finally, the dynamic overset method is modified to address the complex moving body problem. At every time step, the initial hole surface of the previous time step is dynamically adjusted to accomplish hole cutting and avoid the time consuming hole-map procedure. Numerical experiments show that the enhanced overset grid assembly method obtains satisfactory results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79551667029	Computations of wall distances by solving a transport equation	Computations of wall distances still play a key role in modern turbulence modeling. Motivated by the expense involved in the computation, an approach solving partial differential equations is considered. An Euler-like transport equation is proposed based on the Eikonal equation. Thus, the efficient algorithms and code components developed for solving transport equations such as Euler and Navier-Stokes equations can be reused. This article provides a detailed implementation of the transport equation in the Cartesian coordinates based on the code of computational fluid dynamics for missiles (MICFD) of Beihang University. The transport equation is robust and rapidly convergent by the implicit lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LUSGS) time advancement and upwind spatial discretization. Geometric derivatives must also be upwind determined to ensure accuracy. Special treatments on initial and boundary conditions are discussed. This distance solving approach is successfully applied on several complex geometries with 1-1 blocking or overset grids. © 2011 Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79958754246	Numerical investigation of self-aligning spiked bodies at hypersonic speeds	The conventional fixed spike method, in which the spike is mounted with an alignment along the body-axis, always failed at relatively high angles of attack; therefore, a new self-aligning spike method is investigated in the present paper. This method is applied to 3D axi-symmetrical blunt cone and compressed wedge configurations at hypersonic speeds. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify this new concept. Spiked geometries with different L/D parameters at angle of attack ranged from 0 to 12 degrees are investigated. Numerical results reveal that the self-aligning spike method has great capability in drag and heat reduction as compared with the conventional fixed spikes. It can still effectively work even at relatively large angles of attack. This new method can resolve the problem that encountered by the conventional spike method.

79959787035	Parallel DSMC simulation of lateral jet interaction in rarefied transitional region	A hybrid grid structure DSMC method with Cartesian coordinate meshes and surface unstructured triangular cells is presented for accurately predicting the effects of RCS jet interaction with rarefied atmosphere. The adaptative algorithm ensures the molecular pairs selected in the smallest sub-cells to enhance the space accuracy. The parallel DSMC code with a static random load balancing (BL) technique is used to simulate the lateral jet interaction flowfield of three-dimensional plat plate model in different pressure ratio. The present BL strategies have a preferable speedup and parallel efficiency with a small number of processors. The calculated results of complicated flow structures and surface separation characters have a good agreement with a low density wind tunnel experiment. Under the condition of fixing incoming stream parameters, the separation distances and jet penetrate height in the interacting region increase with nozzle exit pressure ratio. For more and more rarefied atmosphere, the incoming stream has less effects and jet itself affecting region extending much larger.

It shows that the formal turbulent models are competent for the present supersonic flows. However, the simulation of the hypersonic flow, especially for flows at high angle of attack, compressibility modification is needed.

84861689707	A new composite method of hole cutting	The present paper investigates an approach that seeks to reduce the storage of the traditional hole-map method and enhance the reliability. The new composite method is based on the least hole-mapping model, which efficiently reduces the area of the hole-mapping region, and incorporates an ADT search procedure to improve the identification method of the points inside the fringe cells which would otherwise become ambiguous. Through a donor-search judgment, the identification can be accomplished efficiently even for a coarse hole-cutting model. Also a new method named 'inverse mark' is developed here using mesh nodes' information to automatically identify exterior points, which are initial points to advance inside the grid region. Results have shown that the composite method is able to get rid of the restriction of high level approximation, decrease efficiently the amount of Cartesian grid and save storage memory. The present approach is of great efficiency and good reliability to complex configurations including small gap regions. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84861404217	Hermite WENO-based limiters for high order discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured grids	A novel class of weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes based on Hermite polynomials, termed as HWENO schemes, is developed and applied as limiters for high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on triangular grids. The developed HWENO methodology utilizes high-order derivative information to keep WENO reconstruction stencils in the von Neumann neighborhood. A simple and efficient technique is also proposed to enhance the smoothness of the existing stencils, making higher-order scheme stable and simplifying the reconstruction process at the same time. The resulting HWENO-based limiters are as compact as the underlying DG schemes and therefore easy to implement. Numerical results for a wide range of flow conditions demonstrate that for DG schemes of up to fourth order of accuracy, the designed HWENO limiters can simultaneously obtain uniform high order accuracy and sharp, essentially non-oscillatory shock transition. © The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84868359726	Constrained least-squares reconstruction method for mixed grids	In order to enforce the effect of boundary conditions on the solution reconstruction of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, a constrained least-squares method based on arbitrary polyhedral mixed grids is investigated. To make the method simpler, a uniform constrained system is constructed through treating different boundary conditions in the same way. To make use of the advantages of both the elimination approach and the weighting approach, a mixed method is provided to solve the constrained system. The numerical experiments based on laminar plates show that setting the weighting coefficient to 5 is large enough in the weighting approach. The numerical results of a subsonic laminar flow over a plate and a transonic turbulent flow over ONERA-M6 demonstrate that the constrained least-squares method is more accurate than the original least-squares method, especially when bad quality grids are used near the boundary, and that the mixed method shows improved results as compared with the weighting approach.

84869182575	Cell-center ADT algorithm based on ghost cell	For the point search problem in Chimera gird generation, an alternating digital tree(ADT) method based on ghost cells was presented, which operated directly on the cell-centered grid system. The problem caused by the covering area incompleteness of cell-centered grids when constituting ADT data structure can be avoided by introducing ghost cells through extension of the original grid. The result of ADT searching with this method is a list of cell-centered cells, which can be directly traversed to obtain the exact donor cell. Therefore, the Stencil Walk method can be omitted. The use of ghost cells makes point search procedures near the boundary more flexible, providing exact information of donor cell near boundaries, and simplifying the construction of ghost cell system. One major application of the proposed method is expanding the types of the overset boundaries, as the constructed searching space is able to cover the entire grid, resolving the problem for the symmetry plane overset. The test case shows that the method is very reliable, feasible for boundaries, and greatly improves the flexibility of the Chimera grid for complex configurations.

84871603512	Detailed investigation of detached-eddy simulation for the flow past a circular cylinder at re=3900	The flow past a circular cylinder at a subcritical Reynolds number 3900 was simulated by the method of detached-eddy simulation (DES). The objective of this present work is not to investigate the physical phenomena of the flow but to study modeling as well as numerical aspects which influence the quality of DES solutions in detail. Firstly, four typical spanwise lengths are chosen and the results are systematically compared. The trend of DES results along the span increment is different from previous large-eddy simulation (LES) investigation. A wider spanwise length does not necessary improve the results. Then, the influence of mesh resolution is studied and found that both too coarse and over refined grids will deteriorate the performance of DES. Finally, different orders of numerical schemes are applied in the inviscid fluxes and the viscous terms. The discrepancies among different schemes are found tiny. However, the instantaneous flow structures produced by 5th order WENO with 4th order central differencing scheme are more abundant than the others. That is, for the time-averaged quantities, the second-order accurate schemes are effective enough, whereas the higher-order accurate methods are needed to resolve the transient characteristics of the flow. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

To accelerate the intergrid-boundary definition much more, a neighbor-to-neighbor donor search algorithm based on advancing-front method is modified with the help of minimum cuboid boxes. To simplify the communications between different grid cell types and to obtain second-order spatial accuracy, a new interpolation method is constructed based on linear reconstruction, which employs only one layer of fringe cells along the intergrid boundary. For unsteady flows with relative motion, the intergrid boundary can be redefined fast and automatically.

84879782871	Improvement of Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model for supersonic complex flows	Entropy represents the dissipation rate of energy. Through direct numerical simulation (DNS) of supersonic compression ramp flow, we find the value of entropy is monotonously decreasing along the wall-normal direction no matter in the attached or the separated region. Based on this feature, a new version of Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model (BL-entropy) is proposed in this paper. The supersonic compression ramp and cavity-ramp flows in which the original Baldwin-Lomax model fails to get convergent solutions are chosen to evaluate the performance of this model. Results from one-equation Spalart-Allmaras model (SA) and two-equation Wilcox k-ω model are also included to compare with available experimental and DNS data.

84880389104	Entropy increment ratio concept and its application to turbulence models	The concept of entropy increment ratio (s̄) is proposed in this paper, based on a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of boundary-layer flows on plates at different Mach numbers (Ma=0.7, 2.25, 6). s̄ represents the dissipation per unit mechanical energy, and is numerically monotonic and independent of Mach number changes, so it can reliably characterize the range of boundary layers. Employing this concept, we reconstruct the length scale of Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model (BL) and bring forward BL-entropy. Flow fields of a backward-facing step at low-speeds and a cylinder with conical flare at hypersonic speeds are numerically simulated to evaluate the performance of this new model. The results from the original BL model (BL-origin) and one-equation Spalart-Allmaras model (SA) are also included to be compared with the available experimental data. The comparison shows that BL-entropy could conquer the essential deficiency of the original model, providing a more physically length scale and smoother eddy viscosity distribution.

In contrast, SLAU and SLAU2 can give reliable results.

To study the prediction performance of the k-ω-γ transition model on forced boundary layer transition and the effects of different trips on boundary layer transition, a wall temperature effect modification is conducted on the original k-ω-γ transition model, and the modified k-ω-γ transition model is employed to investigate the forced boundary layer transition ona hypersonic vehicle forebody. The transition onsets of forebodies with no trip, with diamond trips and with ramp trips under Mach 6 and 7 are studied by numerical simulation, and the results are compared with those from the experiment. It is found that the modified k-ω-γ transition model can well predict forced boundary layer transition, and the transition onset locations of numerical simulation are consistent with experiment results. Both diamond trips and ramp trips can obviously promote boundary layer transition forward to reduce flow separation and lateral flow spillage. Disturbances caused by diamond trips are stronger than those by ramp trips, and the transition length is shorter than that of ramp trips as well. However, ramp trips show a better performance on controlling boundary layer flow separation and reducing lateral flow spillage compared with diamond trips.

Firstly, the spectral property of the DG method is analyzed using the approximate dispersion relation (ADR) method and compared with typical finite difference methods, which reveals quantitatively that significantly less grid points can be used with DG for comparable numerical error. Then several typical test cases relevant to problems of compressible turbulence are simulated, including one-dimensional shock/entropy wave interaction, two-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence, and two-dimensional temporal mixing layers. Numerical results indicate that higher numerical accuracy can be achieved on the same number of degrees of freedom with DG than high order finite difference schemes. Furthermore, shocks are also well captured using the localized artificial diffusivity method. The results in this work can provide useful guidance for further applications of DG to direct and large eddy simulation of compressible turbulent flows. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84905232555	A new flux splitting scheme for the Euler equations	With the rapid development of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), schemes with higher levels of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency are in increasing demands. To achieve this goal, we propose a new scheme called E-AUSMPW in this paper. This scheme adopts the Zha-Bilgen splitting procedure by theoretical analysis and computes the convection flux like AUSMPW+. Moreover, it uses different methods to simulate the pressure flux's terms respectively. Series of numerical experiments show that E-AUSMPW is with a high level of robustness against shock anomalies. In addition, it is much more robust against the 'overheating phenomenon' than others. Besides these merits above, it is also with high accuracy and high efficiency orders in hypersonic heating predictions. Thus, E-AUSMPW is promising to be widely used to accurately and efficiently simulate both simple and complex flows. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84907045759	Assessment of shock capturing methods for numerical simulations of compressible turbulence with shock waves	The direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows raise challenges to the numerical schemes, especially when they are combined with shock waves. The two demands of the schemes seem to be contrary: the simulation of small turbulence scales requires non-dissipative schemes while the capture of shock waves requires dissipative schemes. To have a systematic comparison of some popular schemes' properties in solving the problems above, a suite of test cases were displayed, Taylor-Green vortex, Shu-Osher problem, and compressible isotropic turbulence. Through systematic analysis and comparisons, results show that the widely used high order schemes are capable of satisfying the two demands required above in some extent. However, both of them have their advantages and disadvantages compared to each other and no one can be called perfect. Thus, they are still far from the theoretic object, and their improvements are in high demands.

84911965378	Assessment of shock capturing schemes for discontinuous Galerkin method	This paper carries out systematical investigations on the performance of several typical shock-capturing schemes for the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, including the total variation bounded (TVB) limiter and three artificial diffusivity schemes (the basis function-based (BF) scheme, the face residual-based (FR) scheme, and the element residual-based (ER) scheme). Shock-dominated flows (the Sod problem, the Shu-Osher problem, the double Mach reflection problem, and the transonic NACA0012 flow) are considered, addressing the issues of accuracy, non-oscillatory property, dependence on user-specified constants, resolution of discontinuities, and capability for steady solutions. Numerical results indicate that the TVB limiter is more efficient and robust, while the artificial diffusivity schemes are able to preserve small-scale flow structures better. In high order cases, the artificial diffusivity schemes have demonstrated superior performance over the TVB limiter.

84916884485	Analysis for centered nonoscillatory scheme of third order	Choosing symmetric stencils, a centered nonoscillatory scheme of third order scheme (Cn3) constructs a formula which achieves third-order accuracy. A modification of the original estimates, in the reconstruction procedure, was undertaken by employing a monotonicity region as well as an accuracy one. After the very modification, the Cn3 scheme not only obtained nonoscillatory results near discontinuities but also achieved high-accuracy calculation in smooth regions. By using several typical one- and two-dimensional test cases, Cn3 scheme was compared with the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes of third and fifth order. The properties of capturing discontinuities, stability/robustness and numerical dissipation were significantly considered. The results of the numerical experiments confirm that Cn3 scheme has the ability to suppress spurious numerical oscillations near shocks and contact discontinuities when sharply capturing them, which indicates its characteristics of stability and accuracy, and has low dissipation in smooth region at the same time. Cn3 scheme is worth of further study and application.

84921022419	Influence analysis on grid scale limiter of XY-SAS model	The Xu & Yan scale adaptive simulation (XY-SAS) model is based on the introduction of the von Karman length scale into the destruction term of spalart-allmaras (SA) turbulence model, which results in a large eddy simulation (LES)-like behavior in unsteady regions of the flowfield without explicit grid dependence. Because the SAS models could not provide sufficient damping of the smallest scales, the grid spacing was introduced as the high wave number damping limitation. Three different XY-SAS models were constructed by using various grid limiters and were tested by the numerical example of circular cylinder at Re=3 900. The numerical results were compared with detached eddy simulation (DES) and experimental data. It is concluded that, the grid limiter has a strong influence on the performance of the model and the minimum grid spacing is a good limitation, under which the XY-SAS model performs as well as DES method.
