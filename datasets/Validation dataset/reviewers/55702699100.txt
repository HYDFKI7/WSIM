14744296486	New achievements of petroleum geology theory and its significances on expanding oil and gas exploration field	With the great development of China s oil and gas exploration in recent years, some new petroleum geological phenomena couldn't be explained with the known knowledge of petroleum geology theories. It is important to input new theoretical concepts from following several aspects. The rich-hydrocarbon depressions have the characteristic of 'Sag-Wide Oil-Bearing', which means that there are very high probability of oil reservoir formation owing to alternations of source rocks and sheet sandbody in the rich-hydrocarbon depression. The exploration scope can be spread from 'secondary structural zone' to the whole sag and depression. There are new geological features for the middle and deep parts in the superimposed basins. The retarding process of hydrocarbon generation under overpressure can widen and deepen the liquid hydrocarbon window, which provides more chances for finding liquid hydrocarbon in deep horizons. The distribution of deep horizon reservoirs experiencing multiple-stage tectonic movements is inconsistent with the theory of 'source kitchen control theory'. Under the control of early reservoir formation, later burial, resistant compaction due to overpressure, structural uplifting as well as halite 'suspension' and secondary diagenesis, there are favorable reservoir rocks in deep horizons. The oil-bearing and gas-bearing abundance of secondary structural zones in the multistage superimposition process varies largely. There developed over-late reservoir in the deep formation under annealing geological background. The high-efficiency formation of natural gas reservoirs is controlled by time-space matching of hydrocarbon generation, reservoir formation process and combination of formation elements. Therefore, hydrocarbon generation thermodynamics was introduced to the evaluation of gas source kitchens. The concept of high-efficiency gas source kitchen was proposed, and the new evaluation index was established in this paper. The preserve mechanism and distribution rule of efficient process of reservoir formation and excellent elements of petroleum system in petroliferous basins of China were analyzed.

14844351386	Control of basement fault minor-activity on gas pool formation of Upper Paleozoic, Ordos Basin	Large amount of fractures developed in tight reservoir rock in Upper Paleozoic in Ordos Basin. Based on the frequency analysis of abnormal value of permeability from a lot of data, the distribution of fractures in the central-east part of this basin is forecast which trend to NE, located mainly in area of NE basement faults. The heterogeneity of basement in Ordos Basin has led to the activity with minor scale of basement faults in the dominant NE orientation in particular since Mesozoic, which had given strong influence not only on the fracture forming, but also the gas pool forming. The secondary gas pool is believed to be discovered in the future exploration in the NE basement fault area.

The technical predication procedure is simplified as 'six determinations' including the determination of scale, quality and history of active source kitchens, the determination of the critical moment in the formation of the major hydrocarbon and the formation and adjustment of hydrocarbon pool, the determination of direction of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation, the determination of major hydrocarbon migration and accumulation unit, the quantification of the resource potential, the accurate evaluation of oil and gas abundances and risks of the exploration targets in the major hydrocarbon migratron and accumulation units.

18344367288	Petroleum resource and exploration potential of main petroliferous basins onshore in China	Petroleum is the important strategic material related to the security of national politico, economy and military affairs, and it is also the power of economic development. The indemnification of petroleum supply and demand directly influences the stabilization of the state economy and the safety of society to a large extent. Oil and gas resources are abundant in China. The amount of remaining oil and gas resources is still large although the exploration extent of the main oil-bearing basins onshore is high. After oil and gas exploration in tens of years, the preservation conditions of remaining oil resources became worse, and the proportion of low-quality resources was augmented. The concealment of remaining oil and gas resources is boosting up, and oil and gas exploration is getting more difficult. Therefore, the oil and gas exploration in future should depend on the advancement of science and technology as well as reduction of cost, in order to increase the reserves and benefits.

18344376224	Discussion on classification systems of oil and gas resources and reserves	The classification of resources and reserves is the execution criterion in assessment and administration of oil and gas resources and reserves. It is also an important gist for constituting development and utilization program of national resources and for making the policy of resource management. At present, it is important to establish the ranking and classification systems for assessment of resources and for estimation and administration of reserves. The systems should meet the demands of assessment and management of resources and reserves in our country and also be basically connected our rail with the foreign ranking and classification systems. The international ranking and classification systems of resources and reserves were investigated, and a new ranking and classification system for assessment of oil and gas resources and reserves was presented, according to current actuality and future requirements of resource assessment, reserve estimation and administration. The new classification system has been joined with the classification history and connected with the international currency rules.

18344395186	New advancements of oil and gas resource assessment methods	In order to improve the oil and gas resource assessment in the main basins implemented by PetroChina Company Limited, three main assessment methods including genetic method, analogical method and statistical method were analyzed. A lot of new advancements in the research of assessment methods were acquired. By introducing the petroliferous system theory, the genetic method was greatly improved and suitable for better understanding about the process of oil and gas generation, migration and accumulation. By establishing the uniform low-limit standard for the effective source rocks and the hydrocarbon generation plate of various source rocks, the computation precision of hydrocarbon-generation amount was improved. The difficult problem about determination of the quantitative values of migration-accumulation coefficient was solved by dissection of independent oil migration and accumulation u-nits. The database for analogical method was established, according to the dissection of 123 calibrated units with various types. The database can not only strengthen the functions of analogical method and improve the forecast precision of oil and gas resources but also determine the spatial distribution and the quality of resources. New advancements about the function of statistical method were also expanded.

19044380453	Successive generation of natural gas from organic materials and its significance in future exploration	The mechanism of natural gas successive generation from organic materials means that the organic material converts with development of geothermal evolution from the kerogen thermal degradation to the thermal cracking of liquid hydrocarbon or soluble organics specifically in coal measures, leading to the relay contribution of natural gas generation from kerogen degradation to liquid hydrocarbon cracking at different stages of thermal evolution. The successive generation model of natural gas contains two aspects of ideas: (1) The gas generated from kerogen thermal degradation generally takes place earlier than those from liquid hydrocarbon or soluble organic cracking. The gas generative dynamics of different organic matter shows that the major gas generation period from I, II and III types of kerogen occur respectively in the thermal evolution stages of R

From the viewpoint of fluid dynamics, the relationship of the pressure energy and potential energy between source and reservoir in different lithostratigraphic reservoirs was studied based on the analysis of fluid potential composition characteristics. The pressure and potential differences, which constitute the fluid potential, were analyzed, and 3 driving mechanisms were proposed as below-source pressure difference driving, in-source fluid pressure difference driving and above-source potential difference driving. Also presented are petroleum accumulation dynamics and oil-gas migration-accumulation mechanisms of below-source, in-source and above-source lithostratigraphic reservoirs in the South Songliao Basin, and the controlling factors of the petroleum accumulation and distribution for the 3 types of reservoirs.

24344510338	Detection of gas reservoir by using seismic attenuation attributes in wavelet-scale domain	Starting from the equation of instantaneous parameters and scale energy in wavelet domain, the paper considered that the energy attribute and instantaneous attributes in wavelet scale domain can represent attenuation character of seismic signal in a certain scale scope and defined them as attenuation attributes of seismic wave in wavelet scale domain. Its meanings are as follows: (1) the scale of scale energy of real seismic signal can reach maximum at extreme point and scale energy of reflected signal exponentially decreases with the decrease of scale within a bandpass scope starting at that scale; (2) the scale energy computed within the bandpass area along the small-scale direction starting in the scale at extreme point is called as energy-attenuated attribute of seismic wave scale, the instantaneous parameters sections in relative scale are also classified as the category of attenuation attribute in wavelet scale of seismic wave. The theoretical study and analysis of cases showed that the attenuation attribute of wavelet is more sensitive to gas reservoir by comparison with ordinary instantaneous amplitude attribute, the detective effects by attenuation attribute of wavelet is obviously better than that by ordinary instantaneous amplitude attribute when detecting the thin gas-bearing beds or on noise-bearing seismic records.

27744554528	Lithological architecture, geological processes and energy-field environments are major factors for the formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs	The formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs is controlled by three major factors; lithological architecture, geological processes and energy-field environments. Among the three major factors, lithological architecture provides the storing medium for hydrocarbon; geological processes include hydrocarbon generation, migration, accumulation, preservation and modification; and energy-field environments refer to the various geothermal and geodynamic forces that affect the lithological architecture and drive the geological processes. In this study, we take Kela-2 and Sulige gas reservoirs as two examples to study relationships among the three major factors, and explain how these factors influence the scale and quality of hydrocarbon reservoirs.

3142755666	Recognition technique and application of structure-lithology pool in the south of Songliao Basin	In the south of Songliao Basin, large-area and low-abundance pool is the key area for increasing reserves and production. At present, it is facing the main problems of low abundance, small fault, thin sand layer, having complex and levity reservoir and relying mainly on composite structure-lithology reservoir. The pertinent techniques for controlling the problems of low, little and thin trap were adopted, including the techniques of very 3D-seismic interpretation and velocity-varying mapping accounted for low-amplitude traps, both of coherence and dip-layer checking for small fault, multi-parameter lithology inversion for thin sand layer under control of seismic facies. Finally, optimum well location is sought after appraised synthetically. It has gotten obvious results in verifying and finding out one batch of composite structure-lithology reservoir through drilling.

33646891532	Characteristics of deep-buried fragmental reservoirs in central Junggar Basin and the effect of hydrocarbon emplacement on reservoirs diagenetic mineral evolution	Based on the data of thin section, scanning electron microscopy, properties of reservoirs and XRD of clay minerals, the petrological characteristics of the Permian and Triassic reservoirs in central Junggar Basin were analyzed. Effects of hydrocarbon emplacement on reservoirs'diagenetic mineral evolution were carefully discussed. The results show that the reservoirs are dominated by litharenite and have a high content of volcanic cuttings. The properties of reservoirs are of low porosity and low permeability, but the properties of reservoirs below 4000m are obviously better. Properties of oil-bearing reservoirs are obviously better than those of reservoirs without oil. The contents of some diagenetic minerals such as calcite, laumontite and illite have a decreasing trend with the elevation of oil-bearing level, suggesting that the reservoirs'diagenetic mineral evolution has been restrained by hydrocarbon emplacement. Hydrocarbon emplacement plays an important role in improving the properties of deep-buried reservoirs in the basin.

33748754379	Status quo, challenges and future strategies of development technology for marginal oil fields in China	Onshore marginal oil fields in China primarily refer to the difficult-to-produce fields with complex geology, including low-permeability, heavy oil, complex faulted-block fields, etc.. A large amount of in-door researches and field pilot tests on marginal oil fields have been carried out in China. Successful experiences have been accumulated and the cost-effective technology for the development of marginal fields has been established. Most of the recently discovered fields are classified as marginal fields and featured by ultra-low permeability, low productivity, low abundance and/or high viscosity, imposing a challenging problem of development on operators. It is crucial to establish scientific, practical and cost-effective technologies by enforcing basic studies on geology and engineering, enhancing technological innovations, rigorously groping for the development modes and strategies under different circumstances, accumulating good experiences, and changing bias ideas on the marginal fields. The economic issue is the key problem for the marginal field development. Methods and technologies capable of reducing the costs and suited to local conditions should be encouraged.

33748875625	Measures of scale based on the wavelet scalogram with applications to seismic attenuation	The attenuation of seismic signal is usually characterized in the frequency domain using Fourier power spectra and is often usefully characterized by average measures, such as the center frequency or spectral mean. Fourier analysis, however, suffers from time-frequency resolution problems. Wavelet analysis has better time-frequency localization and offers superior spectral decomposition. In this paper, we show that seismic attenuation can be characterized by the scalogram (also called energy density) in the wavelet domain. A single scale encompasses a frequency band. The scalogram relates absorption to peak-scale variations. The peak scale is the scale of maximum amplitude in the scalogram. Seismic attenuation can be estimated directly from the scalogram according to the scale shift of the data and can also be described indirectly by the centroid of scale (the mean of a scalogram). In absorbing media, seismic attenuation increases with frequency, i.e.,decreases with scale. In the wavelet domain, small-scale energies of the seismic signal are attenuated more rapidly than are large-scale energies as waves propagate. As a result, both the peak scale and the centroid of the signal's scalogram increase during propagation. Under the assumption of a frequency-independent Q model, these increases of the peak scale and the centroid of scale are inversely proportional to the quality factor, i.e., a lower quality factor results in an upshift of the peak scale in the scalogram and an increase of the centroid of scale. The peak-scale-shift method can be applied to seismic data with sufficiently broad signal bandwidth. The centroid of scale can be used as an attribute to qualitatively characterize seismic attenuation. Examples of gas detection in both synthetic and field data show the value of this technique. © 2006 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

33749493578	Geological analysis and physical modeling of structural pumping in high effective formation of Kela 2 gas field	In a 3-D closed geological body, in case "structural expanding" inside is induced by stress, it can produce the pressure difference between the expanding cell and surrounding rock, then generate a pumping force directed toward the cell and accelerate the directional flow of fluid in the strata. The structural style and conditions of gas reservoir-formation in the Kuqa depression are favorable to the structural pumping. According to similarity principle, a physical modeling of structure formation and gas filling process of the Kela 2 gas field has justified the occurrence of structural pumping and its important role in gas-reservoir formation with high efficiency under the compressive and well-sealed circumstance. Therefore, authors propose that structural pumping is an important mechanism of gas reservoir-formation with high efficiency in the Kuqa depression. © Science in China Press 2006.

33846098717	Nonlinear process control of wave-equation inversion and its application in the detection of gas	The wave equation describes how seismic waves propagate in the subsurface. Inversion methods based on the wave equation naturally take into account the complex behavior of propagating waves and can be used to make accurate estimates of model parameters. However, computational cost and poor convergence have not been overcome, and thus restrict the broad application of this technique. Preconditioned conjugate gradient inversion using back-propagation techniques is a simple, robust implementation of wave-equation inversion in which the step length for correcting the model for each iteration is a crucial factor affecting convergence and hence computational cost. The step length can be calculated by an adaptive controller based on the theory of model reference nonlinear control that ensures that the error energy of the complex system vanishes rapidly. Although the computational cost for each iteration remains the same, the inversion is robust and converges more rapidly than other methods. We tested our method on synthetic data generated from a three-layer fractured model. The inversion converges to the true model after five iterations, and different initial models give similar inversion results. The application to 2D real data from a gas field in western China illustrates that even two iterations yield unambiguous interpretable inversion sections. © Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

33846526040	Methods of determining proved reserves by SEC standard	There are two steps in determining proved reserves by the SEC standard, i. e. defining reservoir boundary and determining reserves boundary based on the well. Reservoir boundary consists of oil-gas-water contact, the boundaries of fault, stratum, and lithology, and the lowest known oil/gas (LKO/G) etc. The key issue in determining reservoir boundary by LKO/G is to estimate the hydrocarbon-water system so as to determine which one is reasonable among LKO, the cumulative net pay and the biggest net pay of monolayer. The upside boundary of reservoir should be determined only by the top of oil layer before a gas cap is proved not exist. Faults of all levels are categorized as fault boundary in the SEC standard. Determining reasonable development well spacing is the key in identifying the boundary of proved reserves. The drill platform is also an important factor for ocean oil/gas fields. The aim of determining the boundary is to make sure the higher certainty of the proved reserves and to protect stockholders' interests.

It controls the formation and distribution of stratigraphic-lithological reservoirs with the same geological backgrounds and genesis. The stratigraphic-lithological hydrocarbon reservoir is the main exploration object in the hydrocarbon accumulation zone. The clear target beds and excellent description methods are necessary. The stratigraphic-lithological hydrocarbon accumulation zone was divided into lithological change zone and stratigraphic change zone according to the main controlling factors and then divided into front facies zone, fan near shore, river channel, overlap zone and unconformity zone according to the deposit facies type and stratigraphic contact relation.

34250343404	Analysis of methanogen membrane lipids and its application to Sanhu depression, Qaidam basin	Biogenic gas is the product of methanogen in anaoxic environment. Its formation and occurrence is controlled by the distribution of methanogen. The present method in studying the distribution of methanogen is MPN (numbers of methanogen). Because methanogen is strict with its environment, especially with the occurrence of oxygen, trivial change should disturb the bacterial collects and make the number different from the reality. Otherwise, collection of the fresh groundwater is difficult for us. All those make MPN turn to be hard to be dealed with. The concentration of some special biomarkers of methanogen, especially its core membrane components, could reflect the distribution of methanogen for a time. This method is simple and easy to operate, could make up the deficiency. In this paper, the distribution of archaeol, the core membrane structure components, is analyzed in the sediment from two wells in the Sanhu depression Qaidam basin. The results showed a good relationship between methanogen and salinity. In high salt area, the activity of methanogens was depressed in the shallow (above 1000m), and then turned to active up to 2000m. While in the surrounding area like Sebei 1 area, the salinity of sediment is much lower, the depression of methanogen in the shallow is slight that make methanogen mainly concentrate above 1000m and is low below 1000m. In the final, combined with the sediment palaeoenvironment and salinity of the sediment, the activation of methanogen in Sanhu depression is characterized.

34250358688	Preliminary discussion on accumulation mechanism of sand lens reservoirs	Petroleum accumulation of sand lens is a long controversial problem, because some sand lenses immerged in source rocks form reservoirs but others not. The accumulation mechanism of sand lens is discussed from hydrocarbon-generation dynamics, capillary pressure and fluidic exchange on surface between source and reservoir rocks, and demonstrated by physical simulation experiments. The study shows that fluidic pressure difference drives the petroleum generated from source rocks towards the sand lens, capillary pressure difference drives the petroleum situated at the contact belt into the sand lens, and buoyancy has the petroleum accumulated on the top of the sand lens. Meanwhile, water in the sand lens naturally escapes from sandstone to mudstone under the capillary pressure difference. So the sand lens can form reservoirs. The sand lenses without forming reservoirs may be relative to the insufficiency of hydrocarbon-driving dynamics and the stop of fluidic exchange passage due to the hydrocarbon-generating peak period being later than the diagenesis and cementation periods.

Six oil fields were discovered while 148 million tons of oil reserves have also been discovered. This exploration would not be made possible without the use of modern technology. For 6 years of exploration experience, they have come up with four sets of matched prospecting technology that is suitable for the deep fractured complex reservoirs in the Kulongshan thrust belts that had good results.

The quality of seismic image was improved as it had better confirmed the existence the Kulongshan. The identification and evaluation processes has been established to accurately identify fractured reservoirs. The formation protection agent is used to control the drilling fluid density that might bring serious formation damage. Lastly, the deep acidization frees hydrocarbons from the fractured reservoirs to the maximum content to enhance production.

Great progresses were made on the exploration of lithologic-stratigraphic reservoirs in continental lacustrine basins. There were successive significant discoveries in the foreland thrust belts in western and central China. Outstanding achievements were from the middle and lower combinations of superimposed basins. Precise exploration turned out to be a productive tool in mature basins. The offshore discoveries were tremendous. By the end of the period, oil exploration was steady, and gas exploration was growing rapidly. The hydrocarbon reserves growth was in a new peak stage, and the reserve/production ratio was improved markedly. During the 11th Five-Year Plan, the hydrocarbon exploration will be developing rapidly. New discoveries will emerge unceasingly in seven domains: hydrocarbon-rich sags in rift-subsidence basins, large lithologic-stratigraphic reservoirs in huge depression basins, marine carbonates, large cratonic palaeohighs, foreland thrust belts, offshore deepwater, and unconventional oil and gas resources.

37849016817	Analysis on forming conditions of deep marine reservoirs and their concentration belts in superimposed basins in China	By taking the Tarim Basin, Sichuan Basin and Ordos Basin as examples, the conditions for deep marine reservoir formation were illustrated in three aspects listed below: late-stage superimposition style, burial history and structural deformation of the marine stratigraphic system. The burial history of marine source rocks can be divided into three types, i.e., type I, type II and type III, which are obviously different from the case with present hydrocarbon phases in terms of hydrocarbon generation and petroleum-reservoir formation. Based on evolution history, the structural belts in the marine stratigraphic sequence can also be divided into four types, i.e. earlier normal fault-later fault-fold type, earlier uplift-later fault-fold type, earlier uplift-later flattened slope type, and earlier depression-later thrust type. In this paper, a successive gas generation model was proposed, and it was particularly pointed out that coupling of geothermal field annealing evolution and tectonic subsidence and late gas generation from dispersed liquid hydrocarbon in highly matured to over-matured source rocks are key factors for formation of marine petroleum reservoirs. The geological conditions for formation of high-grade reservoirs in deep marine system, covering early hydrocarbon injection, deep denudation and buried dolomitization, were summarized. It was finally concluded that three major structural belts, i.e. paleo-uplift belt characterized by composite hydrocarbon accumulation, paleo-fault belt and high-energy sedimentary facies belt, were involved in marine hydrocarbon accumulation. © 2007 Science in China Press.

37849020943	Two accumulation modes of marine-origin natural gas in the Tarim Basin	Hetianhe gas field, Lungudong gas field and Tazhong gas field are marine marine-origin natural gas reservoirs in the craton area in the Tarim Basin. The natural gas is generated from Cambrian source rocks. The simulation experiment indicated that the cracking of the dispersedly dissoluble organic matter remaining in the source rocks is the main origin of marine natural gas. There are two modes to form gas reservoirs, one is the dry gas reservoir such as Hetianhe gas field, in which gas accumulated on the fault belt with violent tectonic movement, the other is condensate gas reservoir formed on the inheriting uplift such as Lunnan and Tazhong gas fields. The hybrid simulation experiment of cracking gas and crude oil indicated that crude oil accumulated on a large scale in those uplift belts at the early stage, and natural gas filled the ancient oil reservoir at the late stage, and the gas reservoirs were formed after the gas mixed with the crude oil. © 2007 Science in China Press.

37449006356	Thermal anomaly and thermal evolution of source rocks in Mesozoic, Ordos Basin	Based on the logical boundary conditions defined, the results of thermal evolution modeling of the Ordos Basin show that the temperature gradient of the Mesozoic Erathem during middle-late Jurassic is mainly from 43°C/km to 46°C/km, and locally (at Xifeng. Qingyang and their southwestern areas) beyond 57°C/km. Combining the relationship between heat flow and lithospherie thickness with the evidence of seismic, gravity and magnetics, this paper concludes that the pattern leading to the Mesozoic thermal anomaly of this basin may he the stacking of crustal thinning regionally and concealed magma healing locally. In the context of thermal anomaly, hydrocarbons would be generated from the Triassic Yanchang Formation source rock when its burial depth reached 1600 meters in the Jurassic period. The mass hydrocarbon generation occured in the early Cretaceous epoch. Multiple-phase hydrocarbon fillings arc due to long expulsion process and tectonic adjustment.

38849143120	A new model of petroleum migration inspired by earthquake and its generating boundary conditions	Natural and artificial earthquakes can trigger off some acceleratory motion tendency of ground fluids. The motion tendency will behave as some impetus of fluids migration if rock media is the reference frame of fluids migration. Based on the ideal model of pore structure and stress analysis of oil column unconsidering mass diffusion, the occurrence boundary conditions of petroleum migration under the action of earthquake are discussed. Those boundary conditions include the length of oil column, pore size, pore-throat, and different fluid pressure status. The results indicate that earthquake can inspire oil column migration through some special pore structure before fractures appear. The detailed analysis shows that lower pore/throat ratio, bigger radius of pore and longer continuous oil column are good for petroleum migration, that petroleum migration inspired by earthquake becomes easier in turn in the following cases: the lateral vibration of earthquake acts on formations with normal fluid pressure, the vertical vibration with normal fluid pressure, the lateral vibration with abnormal fluid pressure, and the vertical vibration with abnormal fluid pressure.

The analyses of core, thin sections, minor element, liquid fluid inclusion, XRD, cathodoluminescence and electron microprobe suggest that dolomitization and dissolution are the key factors, and mixing dolomitization and buried dolomitization are the basic factors for forming favorable reservoirs in Feixianguan Formation. In the oolitic bank reservoirs four periods of dissolution can be identified including the surface meteoric water dissolution, organic water dissolution during shallow-buried, organic water dissolution during deep-buried period and the dissolution in the basin risen up, of them the organic water dissolutions during the shallow-buried and deep-buried periods are the important dissolutions for forming favorable dolomite reservoirs.

The authors point out that the Qin-Qi Fold Belt and Alashan ancient land controlled the borderline of the western Ordos prototype basin in Later Triassic. The large borderline faults of west Liupanshan and west Helanshan were the southwest and northwest borderlines of the Upper Triassic prototype basin. There is no clear boundary line between the Hexi Corridor and the cadre of the basin. The prototype basin is a large NW-SE asymmetric depressed basin, which is deep in south and shallow in north. The Yinchuan Basin and Liupanshan Basin are part of the prototype basin in the Yanchang stage of Upper Triassic. There are four delta sedimentary systems, which are Ruishuihe-Zhenyuan, Jingtai-Huanxian, Yaoshan-Tianshuipu and Rujigou-Yanding delta sedimentary systems, with different sedimentary characteristics from south to north in western Upper Triassic basin. These delta sedimentary systems were altered in Late Indosinian, Mid-Yanshanian, Late Yanshanian and Himalayan, denudated badly in the hanging wall of the west thrust belt, and conserved integrally in the east of the present thrust belt. The extensive residual Yanchang Formation sedimentary system has good prospecting.

The pool-forming conditions and the rules of petroleum distribution and enrichment are different in them. Based on the correlation between the lithologic and stratigraphic pools found in Jizhong Depression and those in Erlian Basin, five rules of distribution and enrichment are summarized: the scale of basins decides the size of petroleum resources and pools; thickness of matured source rocks controls the pools longitudinal domains; the main oil-forming centers control the shapes of the pools planar distribution, e.g. lithologic pools along the main depressions in the Jizhong Depression are polycyclic-shaped along the depressions, while in Erlian Basin, the pools are hemicyclic-shaped inside the depressions; the geologic fabric builds the main direction of fluid potential and the pools distribution; plays in faulted basins control the pools enrichment.

In this article, an integrated approach was adopted that applies principles and techniques of sequence stratigraphy and seismic sedimentology to the study of higher order sequences, depositional environments, and lithostratigraphic trapping styles. In the Sifangtuozi area, 20 higher order (fourth- or fifth-order) sequences in four third-order sequences were identified in an Upper Cretaceous interval using well and seismic data. Core description and wireline log classification helped identify distributary channel fill, distributary mouth bar, sheet sand, distal bar, prodelta/shallow lake, and semideep to deep lake deposits in fluvial-dominated deltaic systems. In two three-dimensional (3-D) seismic survey areas, seismic inversion and 90° phasing of seismic data converted seismic traces to pseudolithologic logs. Stratal slicing made it possible to interpolate and extrapolate well-dataderived sequence and faciès interpretation to whole 3-D seismic surveys and then make broader interpretations and predictions on sand content, sandstone thickness, and geomorphological information. Play analysis using sandstone isopach or amplitude stratal slices and superimposed structural maps identified potential accumulations in small structural, lithostratigraphic, and combination traps. These traps are all significantly controlled by lithology, reservoir distribution, sealing conditions, and closure. Copyright ©2011. The American Association of Petroleum Geologists.

84877856525	Reservoir types and distribution characteristics of large marine carbonate oil and gas fields in China	Recent analysis of marine carbonate oil and gas fields in Tarim Basin, Sichuan Basin and Erdos Basin reveals that carbonate traps and reservoirs in China can be classified into 4 major categories (i.e. structural traps, lithologic traps, stratigraphic traps and hybrid traps) and 21 types. The paper focuses on only stratigraphic and lithologic traps as they are more common trap types in the country. The lithologic traps can be further classified into bioherm traps, grain bank traps and diagenetic traps. The stratigraphic traps can also be classified into fault-block buried hill traps, peneplain erosion paeleogeomorphologic traps, monadnock buried hill fracture-vuggy traps, quasi-bedded fracture-vuggy traps, stratigraphic wedge traps and stratigraphic onlap pinchout traps. The paper points out that the marine carbonate oil and gas fields on China mainland are mainly of stratigraphic and lithologic reservoirs with moderate to low abundance. The bioherm reservoirs and grain bank reservoirs develop and distribute in a bead-like shape along platform margin, while the peneplain erosion palaeogeomorphologic reservoirs present as the shape of crumbs; the fractured-vuggy reservoirs are distributed widely in the quasi0bedded shape. The large ancient uplift, slope zone and platform margin, are considered favorable areas for cluster distribution of lithologic and stratigraphic oil and gas reservoirs and therefore are regarded to have great potential for hydrocarbon exploration.

41949132054	Geological features and evaluation techniques of deep-seated volcanics gas reservoirs, Songliao Basin	Abstract: The significant breakthrough of natural gas exploration in deep-seated volcanic rocks of Songliao Basin, China, demonstrates that the volcanic rocks as reservoirs can form natural gas accumulations where excellent source-reservoir-caprock assemblages exist. This paper reveals several features of volcanic gas accumulations: (1) Two types of gas reservoirs, including hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons, are developed; the former is organic and usually trapped in shallower volcanics associated with sub-deep-seated faults, while the latter is mainly inorganic and accumulated in deep-seated volcanics associated with large-scale deep-cut basement faults. (2) Lower Cretaceous Shahezi Formation coal series source rocks, Yingcheng Formation volcanics, and Denglouku Formation mudstone form good source-reservoir-seal associations that control the major volcanic plays. (3) Volcanic crater and eruptive facies spread along deep-seated faults, so discordogenic faults control the distribution of large-scale volcanic gas reservoirs. (4) Fracture zones, accompanied with large-scale faults, control the distribution of high-yield zones. (5) Effusive volcanic rocks in the deep parts of sags have huge thickness and touch extensively with source rocks, so the gas accumulation potential is promising if reservoirs exist. Evaluation techniques can be summarized in three steps: (1) Determining the distribution of volcanic rocks by joint inversion of gravitational, magnetic, and seismic data. (2) Predicting the distribution of volcanic reservoirs by multiple methodologies. (3) Predicting the distribution of gas-bearing volcanic rocks by integrated methods, including gas detention. © 2008 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

44649195650	Biogenic gas systems in eastern Qaidam Basin	Several giant biogenic gas fields (with proven gas reserves greater than 25 billion cubic meters) have been discovered in recent years in the Sanhu area of eastern Qaidam Basin. This area has an average surface altitude of around 2800 m, and forms the northern segment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The biogenic gas fields occur mostly within or adjacent to the depocenter of approximately 3400 m of Quaternary sediments. The gas reservoirs, with burial depth generally less than 1900 m, are unconsolidated sandstones with approximately 24-40% porosity, and are interbedded with mudstones containing on average 0.3% TOC. The occurrence of methanogens in the shallow Quaternary sediments appears to depend on both the sedimentary facies and burial depths, thus most of the biogenic gases in the Sanhu area appears to have derived from the source kitchens in the central sag above a biogenic gas floor at the depth around 1800 m. The key gas system elements for the formation of the giant biogenic gas accumulations include (1) secular low surface temperatures and lake water hypersalinity favor the preservation of suitable organic substrates for biogenic methane generation, (2) well-developed sand and mud interbeds, (3) sufficient cumulative thickness of water-saturated mudstones as caprocks, (4) presence of syndepositional anticlines of Pleistocene and later age, (5) a regional hydrogeological system favoring northeastward gas migration, and (6) ongoing dynamic gas migration and accumulation with abundant gas supply. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

45949108161	Formation and distribution of volcanic hydrocarbon reservoirs in sedimentary basins of China	Volcanic hydrocarbon exploration in China has experienced three phases: accidental discovery, local prospecting, and all-round exploration. There are mainly Carboniferous-Permian, Jurassic-Cretaceous, Paleogene-Neogene volcanic rocks and lava, pyroclastics, and karst reservoirs in the oil- and gas-bearing basins in China. Volcanic rocks cannot generate organic hydrocarbons, and the combination of volcanic rocks, source rocks, and seals are the key controlling factor of the primary lava plays. The near-source play is most favorable for hydrocarbon accumulation. Distribution of oil and gas is controlled predominantly by the hydrocarbon generating center. The play requires communication with faults or unconformities. Near-source plays are in the faulted basins in eastern China. Structural-lithologic hydrocarbon reservoirs are formed in the higher place of faults and lithologic hydrocarbon reservoirs are formed on the slope. Two types of plays are developed in central and western China. The near-source play is most favorable for the formation of large stratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoirs. © 2008 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

48549092408	Accumulation and distribution of oil and gas controlled by paleo uplift in poly history superimposed basin	Uplift is a large-scale positive structural element of sedimentary basin and has strong influences on the structural evolution, depositional system and fluid flow in the basin. Uplift has the poly-mechanism in its generation. The extension, compression and strike-slipping environments can give rise to the formation of uplift. With the transition of geodynamic settings, the varied primary-generated uplifts may show the distinct characteristic of superposition owing to the combination of the above-mentioned mechanisms and entitle a kind of much complicated structure and configuration. The evolution of uplift has undergone a process from the formation-period (or embryo-period), growing-period to mature-period and then succeeding, decreasing gradually or disappearing in the end. This process can be called as uplift cycle. Uplift can thus show a shape of any accordingly period of such a developing process. The existing uplift today is in some periods of growing. Uplift is an important area for oil and gas accumulated in petroliferous basin and has great influences upon pool-formation. The uplift during deposition period has restricted the development of the source rock-reservoir rock-cap rock assemblages. The uplift during reservoir-forming period controlled oil-gas accumulation. The uplift during adjusting period or modifying period governed the re-distribution of oil and gas, and the uplift during perching period or burying period controlled the position of oil-gas occurrence. The sedimentary basins are largely the superimposition of proto-type basins in different periods. The poly-history superposition has resulted in the favorable functions on uplift, such as intervals of the multiple oil and gas-bearing in paleo-highs, additional hydrocarbon plays exactly above or below superimposition contacts, large-scale oil-gas accumulation zones resulted from the multi-period charging and accumulation of hydrocarbon and increase of pool-forming probabilities in the uplift, or the generation of the fault-dominated oil-gas accumulation zones owing to the linkage among faults of different periods and the multiple independent petroliferous zones separated by the sealing beds of a later petrogenic origin. The axial and slope zones of the uplifts are favorable for generating a large-scale oil-gas accumulation dominated by the anticline and the lithologic-stratigraphic reservoirs respectively.

48249130463	Cracking conditions of crude oil under different geological environments	There are mainly 3 kinds of existing states of oil generating from source rocks, that is, dispersive liquid hydrocarbon inside of source rock, dispersive liquid hydrocarbon outside of source rock and concentrated liquid hydrocarbon outside of source rock. Because of the differences in thermal history and medium conditions around, and the interaction of organic and inorganic matter, the liquid hydrocarbon with 3 kinds of existing state has different cracking conditions. The gas generation dynamics experiments of crude oil matching different mediums indicate that the distribution of activation energy of methane changes a lot according to medium difference. The carbonate has a main influence on oil cracking conditions and can largely reduce its activation energy, which reflects the lower cracking temperature of crude oil. The mudstone takes a second place and the sandstone is the smallest. The catalytic cracking function to the oil of the carbonate, of the mudstone and of the sandstone changes weaken in turn.

49549093807	PetroChina key exploration domains: geological cognition, core technology, exploration effect and exploration direction	On the basis of the third evaluation on hydrocarbon resources and the distribution estimation of remaining oil/gas resources, PetroChina puts forward four key exploration domains, which are litho-stratigraphic reservoirs, foreland thrust belts, middle and lower combinations of the superimposed basins, and hydrocarbon-rich depressions or plays in the mature exploration areas. The litho-stratigraphic reservoir has become the main body of the reserves growth; the foreland thrust belts are the important domains for finding significant discoveries, the middle and lower combinations in the superimposed basins have increasingly important status in increasing geological reserves, and the fine exploration in hydrocarbon-rich depressions or plays also have prodigious exploration potential. The remaining hydrocarbon resources are mainly distributed in seven domains, which are large-scale litho-stratigraphic reservoirs, hydrocarbon-rich depressions (plays) in rift-subsidence basins, foreland thrust belts, middle-lower combinations in the superimposed basins, onshore new exploring areas and new basins, south areas of South China Sea, and unconventional resources. Among them, the former four domains have great exploration potential and are the important areas for reserves and production growth, and the latter three domains are the important fields of realizing resources strategic relay for PetroChina in the future. © 2008 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

Gas exploration and production have been growing rapidly in China, with proved gas reserves in an escalating trend. The proved gas reserves in Chinese mainland is mainly distributed in several large basins such as Ordos, Sichuan, Tarim and Qaidam. The Middle East and North Africa are still the hot spots of future gas exploration, where gas exploration will keep high speed. Gas exploration will also develop rapidly in Europe due to its rapid growth of gas demand. Gas exploration will get more active in Asia-Pacific region, where gas production will grow rapidly, with an annual growth rate in the range of 2.7-3.1%.

53949108297	Formation and distribution of shallow-water deltas and central-basin sandbodies in large open depression Lake Basins	Shallow-water deltas and central-basin sandbodies in large lacustrine depression basins have become the most important target for the stratigraphic reservoirs exploration in China. Based on the analysis of typical lacustrine shallow-water deltas in modern lakes and the study of lacustrine shallow-water deltas and central basin sandbodies in the Meso-Cenozoic large lacustrine depression basins in China, several recognizes have been obtained as following: (1) Based on the analysis of the geological settings for the shallow-water deltas formation, nine types of lacustrine deltas have been classified according to the feeder systems, lake depth and delta-front gradient; (2) Depositional model for shoal-water profile river deltas has been established which presents the terminal distributary channels and terminal splays; (3) Controls for the large-area shaltow-water deltaic sandbodies have been analyzed and the distribution model of shallow-water deltas and central-basin sands in open lacustrine depression basin has been established, and it is proposed that open lake is the most important basis for the development of large-scale shallow-water deltas in the basin center and outflow channels control the alignment of the central-basin sandbodies; (4) Fluvial, delta, lake current and bottom density current are the main traction currents that formed sandbodies in the basin center, and flooding turbidite fans and slumping turbidite fans are the main sedimentary gravity deposits; (5) The third-order sequence boundaries in the large shallow-water deltas have great influence on the distribution of lithological or diagenetic traps, and superimposed sandbodies on the sequence boundary are abundant of lithological reservoirs in the delta plains which show the great potential for oil and gas exploration. These understandings are helpful to the development of lacustrine sedimentology and the exploration of stratigraphic reservoirs in large lacustrine depression basins.

54049129681	Role of basement faults in gas accumulation of Xujiahe Formation, Sichuan Basin	The Xujiahe Formation is characterized by a large gas-bearing area, low reserve abundance, low yield, and dominantly lithologic gas pools because sandstone reservoirs are tight and low permeable, structures have gentle relief, and faults and fractures are undeveloped. Searching sweet-spots is the key step in gas exploration. The basement heterogeneity in the Sichuan basin has led to the activity of basement faults in NE and NW directions since Meso-Cenozoic, which influences the evolution of sub-structure zones and causes the occurrence of fractures and minor normal faults in Xujiahe Formation reservoirs. These fractures and minor faults improved the reservoirs quality, provided the path for gas migration, and contributed to the formation of local gas-rich trends. Meanwhile, later activity of basement faults caused an abnormally high geothermal field, accelerating the thermal evolution of source rock. The area of basement faults has the most favorable conditions for gas accumulation and is the main target for gas exploration. © 2008 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

57149105762	Principal characteristics and forming conditions for medium-low abundance large scale oil/gas fields in China	In recent years, some of large scale oil or gas fields with medium-low abundance have been discovered in onshore China. They have such characteristics in common as low porosity and permeability, small oil or gas column, low reserves abundance, and large scale. Studies conducted by the authors show that the formations of large-area reservoirs with medium-low abundance have the following favorable conditions: the large scale sandbodies caused by drag flow in the hinterland of large lacustrine basins, alternating broadly with source rocks like "sandwich-type" architecture of reservoir-source rock association, provide fundamental basis of oil/gas accumulation in large scale; the small oil or gas column and normal to low pressure system reduce the restrict requirement on cap-rock quality, which leads to large scale reservoir formation; the strong reservoir heterogeneity with poor connectivity minimizes gas escape energy and ensures wide oil/gas accumulations even in the area with relatively poor geological conditions; the late uplifting and unloading environment makes it possible for source rock desorb and discharge hydrocarbon to form reservoirs with young generation. Studies indicate that there are nice prospects in discovering large scale lithological reservoirs in the synclinal areas of large terrestrial depression basins of China. This concept has guided the oil/gas discoveries in synclinal areas of Ordos, Songliao, and Sichuan Basins, promoted the great increase of oil and gas reserves and shown a good potential for future exploration. © 2008 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

59949094123	Comparative study on volcanic hydrocarbon accumulations in western and eastern China and its significance	Volcanic hydrocarbon accumulations in eastern and western China have both generality and discrepancy. The common features are as follows: Their source-reservoir-caprock association is a near-source type; their reservoir properties are little affected by burial depth and possess strong heterogeneity; the main source rocks are coal measures mudstone and usually have a high geothermal evolution degree. The differences between the two areas are: Volcanic rocks in the eastern area are mainly formed in Mesozoic-Cenozoic intra-continental rifts; those in the western area are in Paleozoic intra-continental rifts and island-arc. Eastern volcanic activity is characterized by central eruption controlled by deep-seated faulting movement, which produced mainly intermediate-acid volcanic rocks; western volcanic activity possesses more eruption types and periods, which produced mainly intermediate-basic volcanic rocks. Reservoir space of volcanic reservoirs is primary pores and fractures in the east, while secondary dissolved pores and fractures in the west. In terms of reservoir types and controlling factors, the eastern reservoirs are mainly lithologic and structural-lithologic, with hydrocarbon accumulations controlled by effective source kitchens, deep-seated faults and volcanic eruption structures, and the in-situ features are obvious; the western reservoirs are mainly stratigraphic unconformity reservoirs, with hydrocarbon accumulations controlled by unconformities, source-reservoir-caprock associations and large faults, and both heterotopic and in-situ features exist.

62749182815	Velocity distribution of upper crust, undulation of sedimentary formation and crystalline basement beneath the ordos basin in north China	Along the line Yanchuan-Baotou-Mandela in the Ordos basin and adjacent Yinshan mountainous area in the north China, a wide-angle reflection and refraction seismic sounding has been carried out yielding Pg wave data of high resolution. By the traveltime differential tomographic imaging, traveltime inversion of the Pg wave field is performed to determine velovity distribution of the upper crust, and undulation of sedimentary formation and crystalline basement along the profile. And geological interpretation to these features is made. The result shows that the upper crust below the Ordos basin is of a double-layer structure, with a distinct interface between the upper and lower layer. The upper layer is characterized by low velocity and big gradients in vertical direction, while the lower layer has high velocity and changes gently. In the light of the velocity distribution in the upper crust of the study area, it is suggested that the sedimentary formation and crystalline basement undulate in NS direction, generating a series of rising and falling structures. From south to north, they are the depression south to Yulin, Yulin- Daotu swell, listric depression from northern Daotu to the fault on the northern edge of Ordos and secondary structure in it, and Hohhot-Baotou depression and its interior faults. In the north, seismic wave velocity in the upper crust beneath the Yinshan Mountains (Mt. ) is obviously higher than that below the areas on the both sides, exhibiting a pattern of longitudinal belt. It reflects the feature of the crystalline basement of this area, which is associated with collage and accretion of several blocks such as the Wula'er shan Mt. , Se'erteng double-layer structure, though its refraction interface of the basement is not so clear as that below the Ordos basin. Based on the structures of sedimentary formation and undulation of the crystalline basement of the study area, we have discussed the sedimentary features and hydrocarbon prospects of every depression along the profile.

74949098028	Petroleum systems of Chinese nonmarine basins	The petroleum systems of Chinese nonmarine rifted and depression basins, dominated by lacustrine strata, have distinctive source rocks, reservoir types and trap characteristics. The rifted basins are characterized by numerous faults and multiple structural salients and sags (half grabens). Sags include many subdivisions and smaller isolated sags. Most sags constitute relatively independent petroleum systems that have efficiently generated and expelled hydrocarbons, have excellent reservoir properties in a variety of sand-body types, and have multiple traps. These attributes impart a petroliferous character to the entire sag. Depression basins (intracratonic flexural basins) developed on large cratons and hosted large lacustrine systems. They feature very gentle structure, large deltaic sand-bodies, source rocks in extensive contact with sand-bodies, heterogeneous low-porosity-low-permeability reservoirs and large, widespread lithology-controlled pools. In recent years, large oil and gas reserves have been discovered in these two types of lacustrine-dominated basins, contributing significantly to the growth of reserves in onshore China, and stratigraphic oil and gas pools have become the major type of accumulation in nonmarine lacustrine basins. © 2009 The Authors.

77952881399	Relationship between the later strong gas-charging and the improvement of the reservoir capacity in deep Ordovician carbonate reservoir in Tazhong area, Tarim Basin	Some large-scale oil-gas fields have recently been discovered in marine carbonate in China, especially the significant discoveries in deep reservoir that reveals a favorable exploration prospect. Tazhong area is the first-order tectonic unit in Tarim Basin, where there are nearly trillion cubic meters of natural gas resources in the Ordovician limestone reef flat complex in Lianglitage Formation. The reservoir is shelf edge reef flat complex, characterized by ultra-low porosity, low permeability and strong heterogeneous, with a current burial depth of 4500-6500 m. Studies find that the formation and distribution of deep reservoir of the Lianglitage Formation were controlled not only by the early high-energy sedimentary facies and corrosion, but the fracture network formed by the strong gas-charging process since the Himalayan epoch, which played an important role in optimizing and improving reservoir properties. This paper discusses the relationship between the strong later gas-charging and the improvement of the reservoir capacity in deep Ordovician carbonate reservoir, and also builts the corresponding mechanisms and modes, which is favorable for the prediction and evaluation of the advantageous exploration targets. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

77953825578	Velocity structure of layered block and deep dynamic process in the lithosphere beneath the Yinshan orogenic belt and Ordos Basin	The Yinshan orogenic Belt in the northern margin of Ordos Basin is not only a transition region between strong and weak tectonic activities, but also a basin/mountain coupling zone, so there are different deep dynamical processes in the orogenic belt and basin region. Based on the high resolution data from a wide-angle reflection and refraction seismic sounding, we get the fine lithospheric structure along the profile of Mandula-Ordos-Yulin-Yanchuan as long as 650 km. Some results are summarized as follows: 1. The crust thickness is about 40 to 45 km from south to north in the profile. The property of medium and structure are different in different tectonic units. Obvious differences exist in the velocity distribution, structure pattern, and interface undulation and attributes. The velocity is 8.0-8.1 km/s on the top layer of the upper mantle. 2. There are five deep and big faults in the profile, dividing the region into four tectonic units with obviously different crust-mantle structure beneath the Ordos Basin, the basinmountain coupling belt, Yinshan orogenic belt, and Inner Mongolia tectonic area, which have respectively inherent deep processes and dynamic responses. Furthermore, we define the Bayan Obo fault between Yinshan and Inner Mongolia as the south boundary of Paleo-Asian Ocean. Subsequently, Yinshan orogenic belt and a good many metallic mineral resources were formed and frequent earthquakes happened. Therefore, the structure of the crust and mantle in this coupling region is quite complicated, and is divided into layers and blocks. Obviously, in the forming of mountains, basins, rocks, minerals and disasters, there are special deep process and dynamic mechanism.

77958465120	Fluid inclusion evidence for charge stages of hydrocarbon in the Ordovician traps of Tazhong area, Tarim Basin	Based on the microscopic thermometry technology and PVT simulation method of fluid inclusions, the trapped temperature and pressure of inclusions which come from Ordovician reservoirs at different drill-holes and buried depths in the Tazhong area were measured and calculated. All the samples belong to one hydrocarbon migration system. In combination with burial history and geothermal history and the method of "to ascertain stages of fluid filling in individual drillholes first, then to calibrate temperature by stages", the homogenization temperature of aqueous inclusions was calibrated in order to enhance the capability to determine charge stages by inclusion temperature data. Six stages hydrocarbon charges occurred in the Ordovician reservoirs. The first five periods of hydrocarbon charges below 132°C are confirmed by the coincidence of the normal-pressure burial depth and the restored trapped pressure of inclusions. The highest temperature stage (156-176°C) was caused by abnormal thermal event. The analysis of oil source and thermal evolution reveals that Tabei uplift (including the Lunnan area), the middle-west section of Tazhong uplift, and the western Manjiaer Sag are areas potential for late accumulated hydrocarbons.

The result of NMR experiments by changing TEs in the uniform magnetic field is greatly different from that in the gradient field. Only the latter can simulate the result of MRIL-Prime tools and guide well logging interpretation. According to foreign successful NMR experiments with multiple TEs in a gradient magnetic field, we discuss the application range of this method and point out that it's better to use timely logging data in order to decrease the effect of drilling mud invasion. Preliminary applications prove it very effective, as a valuable supplement of the resistivity logging method, in the determination of fluid type in complex reservoirs of the Bohai Bay Basin.

Using the travel time data obtained from the seismic sounding record, we determined the S wave velocity structure of the upper crust beneath the profile. Meanwhile, we calculated the Poisson ratio distribution along the profile using both the P wave and S wave velocity data. Based on the seismic wave field properties and structure, as well as the geological research result and the borehole data, the borehole distribution beneath the profile was deducted. The research result suggests that this profile could be divided into four major parts, which are the northern part of the Ordos basin, the Hubao depression basin, Yinshan orogenic belt and the Sunit fold system. There exist different characteristics in velocity structure, Poisson ratio distribution, and lithological composition in these four tectonic units. On basis of all the research mentioned above, we discussed the occurrence and exploitation prospects of mineral resources, coal, oil and gas energy in different tectonic units along the profit.

In fact, the two areas have more differences than they have similarities. Similarities include: (1) the lithology, properties and types of porosity of the reef and oolitic reservoirs are primarily consistent in the two areas; (2) well-developed regional caprocks that seal the fluid system; and (3) accumulation process histories, with liquid hydrocarbon charging at an early stage, cracking into gas at a high to over-mature stage, adjustment of gas reservoirs at an uplifting stage, and final reservoir generation at a late stage. Differences include: (1) gas accumulations in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area that are dominated by oil-type cracked gas, with multiple and sufficient gas sources, contrasting with gas accumulations in the Longgang area that are dominated by coal-sourced gas with insufficient gas sources; (2) heterogeneity and horizontal diversity of reservoirs in the Longgang area that are stronger than in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area; and (3) the development of deep and large faults in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area that link source, reservoir and migration pathways, contrasting with poorly developed faults in Longgang area, where laterally variable fractures are the major migration pathway. Because of these differences, abundant large-scale structurally-controlled gas accumulations are developed in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area, whereas lithology plays a more important role in gas accumulation in the Longgang area where accumulations are smaller-scale and have lower gas-bearing abundance. We suggest that future exploration for reef and oolitic gas accumulations should be strengthened in NE Sichuan and NW Sichuan Jiulongshan. In particular, the transitional zone between Longgang and Kaijiang-Liangping Bay has the best potential for new discoveries. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84862867365	Study on the multi-stage charging and accumulation model of Chinese marine petroleum: Example from eastern Lungu area in the Tarim Basin	Marine sedimentary basins in China have undergone three phases of important tectonic changes in the end of Early Paleozoic, Late Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic and Late Cenozoic. These tectonic changes have exerted strong impacts on the hydrocarbon generation, migration, accumulation and on the occurrence and distribution of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The marine basins in China generally developed multi source rocks. Due to the much difference of their developing age and position, the time of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion between these source rocks is not often synchronous. It is existed that the characteristic of the multi-stage hydrocarbon-charging. Therefore, multi-accumulation of petroleum is an important characteristic of the marine basin in China. Under the influence of multi-stage structural movements, multi-stage accumulation results from multi-stage maturity and expulsing hydrocarbon of multi source rocks. The eastern Lungu area of Tarim Basin is a typical example of multiphase hydrocarbon accumulations in a marine basin of China. At present, it has been determined that three main accumulation stages including Late Caledonian, Late Hereynian and Late Himalayan period. The heterogeneity carbonate reservoir developed in eastern Lungu area, and forming trap-system of seam and holes. After the process of earlier and later structure actions, these traps did not experience big changes. Therefore, the charging-hydrocarbon of three stages has been retained. The three-stage process of hydrocarbon charging is also confirmed by the analysis of geochemical data. Through the geological analysis, the process of hydrocarbon accumulation reappears. And, the model of marine multi-stage hydrocarbon-charging and accumulation is established.

And their distributional features are also summarized. All kinds of marine carbonate reservoirs revealed worldwide are developed onshore China, including 3 types of large-scale effective reservoirs, which are depositional reef-shoal and dolomite reservoirs, epigenetic dissolution-percolation reservoirs and deep burial-hydrothermally altered reservoirs. Besides sedimentary facies, paleoclimate and paleogeomorphy, other factors that have strong influences on the development of deep large-scale reservoirs include interstratal and intrastratal dissolution-percolation, burial dolomitization combined with hydrothermal processes, etc. Large-scale effective reservoirs in deep carbonate sequence are mostly well distributed along the unconformities and hiatuses in sedimentational sequences, while reservoirs with epigenetic dissolution-percolation origion are well occurred from the paleo-uplift highs to the lower part of slopes. The reservoirs are widely distributed in stratified shape on plane, and presented multi-interval distributional patterns controlled by multi-stage karstification vertically with strong heterogeneity. Burial dolomitization is restricted by primary sedimentary facies, and can form extensive effective reservoirs in deep layers in stripe or stratified shape. Hydrothermally related reservoirs are generally distributed along discordogenic faults, forming effective reservoirs with beadlike distribution in vertical direction and band-fence like distribution on plane, which are not restricted by burial depth.

84863079568	Dual-porosity saturation model of low-porosity and low-permeability clastic reservoirs	Abundant non-Archie phenomena have been discovered in rock electrical property experiments of reservoirs with low-porosity and low-permeability, and the classical Archie model is not suitable for the oil saturation calculation in these reservoirs. Based on the pore structure characteristics of these reservoirs, a new dual-porosity saturation model considering the effect of pore structure is presented, namely, the total rock resistance is considered as the parallel resistance of free water resistance and micro-pore water resistance. Both the effects of large pores and micro-pores on rock electrical properties are considered in this model. The model is applied to rock samples to derive the theoretical litho-electric relations which are in good agreement with the experiment measurement. The applications to low-porosity and low-permeability reservoirs of different origins in the east and middle of China show that, compared to the Archie model, the new model considers the effects of rock lithology, physical property, pore structure and oiliness on electrical properties. Therefore, oil saturation resulted from the new model is in good accordance with the real regularity and petrophysical characteristics of reservoirs, and it is much closer to the real oil-bearing conditions.

84865996272	Discovery and exploration significance of structure-controlled hydrothermal dolomites in the Middle Permian of the central Sichuan Basin	Integrated with seismic profile interpretations, Petro-mineralogic observations and geochemical analyses, the present paper proposed that dolomites in the Middle Permian Qixia Formation-Maokou Formation of the central Sichuan Basin are of a structure-controlled hydrothermal origin. The characterization of the dolomites showed that: 1) they are relatively thicker in a single layer, commonly in lenticular form, poor in lateral continuity, sometimes accompanied with developed strike-slip faults and having a "concave-down" reflection in seismic sections corresponding to dolomite intervals concerned; 2) matrix dolomites composed mainly of meso- or macro-crystalline grains have the saddle-shaped dolomite with undulatory extinction stuffed in their fractures and vugs, where a large amount of breccias with white dolomites filled between them develops, forming zebralike fabrics; and 3) homogenization temperatures of matrix and interstitial saddle-shaped dolomites are commonly 5°C higher than those of strata during dolomitization, ranging between 105.8~159.6°C and 113.2~138.6°C, respectively. In addition, they show lighter oxygen isotopes (-7.64‰~-7.95‰) and higher

84872819331	Large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation factors and characteristics of marine carbonate reservoirs in three large onshore cratonic basins in China	In recent years, a series of large oil-gas fields dominated by stratigraphic-lithological reservoirs have been found in marine carbonate reservoirs in three large onshore basins in China, i.e., Tarim Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Ordos Basin. Despite low abundance of reserves in each of these oil-gas reservoirs, their overall scale is large due to cluster distribution. In order to reveal accumulation factors and distribution patterns of large-scale oil-gas fields in marine carbonate reservoirs, this study analyzed and discussed large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation factors and characteristics of marine carbonate reservoirs in the three large cratonic basins from four aspects: (1) tectonic evolution of cratonic basin; (2) distribution of hydrocarbon source kitchen; (3) development conditions of effective reservoirs; and (4) model of hydrocarbon accumulation. Results show that widely distributed hydrocarbon kitchens and their late large-scale accumulation are resource base of large oil-gas fields. A large area of reefs and shoals in stratoid distribution and karst reservoirs controlled by unconformity surface provide effective reservoir space for formation of large oil-gas fields. Coupling of annealing geothermal field and progressive burial is an important mechanism of large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation in marine carbonate reservoirs in the cratonic basins. Downward invasion model, lift model, and switching model are important pathways for petroleum accumulation. This study indicates that palaeouplifts and associated slope zones, reefs and shoals in platform margin zone, intra-platform shoals symbiotic with evaporites, and deep faults meet geological conditions for large-scale oil-gas field formation in carbonate reservoirs, and thus are favorable zones for oil-gas exploration.

84873715380	Large-scale accumulation and distribution of medium-low abundance hydrocarbon resources in China	This paper analyzes the large-scale accumulation conditions and distribution characteristics of medium-low abundance hydrocarbon resources in China. Large-scale development of accumulation elements and their change in scale are the material basis of large scale oil and gas accumulation, determining the regional nature of oil and gas distribution. Liquid hydrocarbon dispersed in marine source rocks being cracked to form a large volume of gas and coal measure source rocks expelling gas during uplift are two important factors for the formation of large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation, which control the scale of source rocks that enter the main gas-generating stage. Volume flow and diffusive flow are the main migration-accumulation mechanism for the large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation, which ensures the sufficiency of hydrocarbon supply. Pancake, layer-like, and cluster are three main accumulation forms of large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation, which ensure the scale of hydrocarbon accumulation. Middle to low abundance hydrocarbon resources are characterized by near-source distribution, main-body play, late accumulation stage and single accumulation type. The periclinal area of palaeo-highs in marine craton basins, the lower slopes and sags in an intra-continental depression basin, and the gentle slopes of foreland basins are the most likely areas for the development of large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation, and they have two types of accumulation, large area and large scope. The proposal of the large-scale accumulation of middle to low abundance hydrocarbon resources in China improves the hydrocarbon discovering potential in middle to deep layers of superimposed basins and in the lower slopes and sags in depression basins, enlarges the exploration scale, and extends the hydrocarbon exploration from local second-order structure zones to the whole basin with the main source rock as the center, and from middle layers to deep, even super-deep, layers. © 2013 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

84876050102	Observation and implication of the paleo-cave sediments in Ordovician strata of Well Lundong-1 in the Tarim Basin	Well Lundong-1 is located in the periclinal area on the eastern flank of the Tahe-Lunnan paleo-uplift in the Tarim Basin. A 25-m-high cave fill sequence was observed in the Upper Ordovician interval of the well at 6800-6825 m. A third cut of cores was obtained from the top of the cave. The following conclusions were obtained by studying the cave sediments and depositional sequence, and by undertaking paleontological and elemental geochemistry analyses. 1. The cave sediments contain abundant brachiopod, gastropod, echinoderm, ostracod, and acritach fossils, which can be classified into two groups: cave autochthonous and cave allochthonous fossils (from collapse breccia dissolution or transportation by underflow). The fossils indicate that the cave was formed before the Carboniferous and partly-filled and buried during Carboniferous resubsidence. 2. Elemental geochemistry shows that the mud that filled the cave is sourced from calcareous paleo-soil and weathered crust that came from a salty environment with poor water circulation. 3. The formation and evolution of the cave occurred in three stages. The first stage occurred after the deposition of the Late Ordovician Lianglitage Formation, the second stage took place after the deposition of the Late Ordovician Sangtamu Formation, and the last stage happened after Silurian deposition. Major dissolution occurred in the latter two stages as a result of bedding-confined deep underflow karstification. Based on the reconstruction of the cave formation history, favorable paleokarst targets can be predicted and estimated to aid paleogeography and paleokarstology studies. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84879542529	Features and genesis of reservoir heterogeneity in the second member of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Fm, Sichuan Basin	Sandstones in the second member of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Fm in the Sichuan Basin are strong in heterogeneity. In order to understand the features and genesis of their heterogeneity, we reviewed the previous studies on structural evolution, sedimentary settings and evolution as well as diagenesis, and performed an analysis of rock grain sizes, composition, and heavy minerals, and laboratory data such as cast thin section, scanning electric microscope, mercury injection and NMR by use of 120 outcrop samples, 160 rock debris samples, and 150 core samples. The following conclusions are obtained. (1) The significant heterogeneity of the sandstone reservoirs is characterized by obviously heterogeneous rock fabric, a large variation coefficient of interlayer and intralayer permeability, a poor lateral connectivity of sandbodies with medium to high porosity and permeability, and the directivity of permeability distribution in channels. (2) The unique structural and sedimentary settings and multistage migrations of channels provide geological conditions for the formation of reservoir heterogeneity in the second member of the Xujiahe Fm. (3) The constructive diagenesis of channel coarse grain sandstone, chlorite liner and alkali feldspar is the key factor controlling the degree of reservoir heterogeneity.

Through mineralogic observations, geochemical analyses and comprehensive interpretations of seismic profiles, the Middle Permian saccharoidal dolomite in Qixia and Maokou formations which are related with hydrothermal dolomitization have following characteristics: (1) higher occurrence frequency, greater thickness in a single layer (5~40 m), host limestone dominated by bioclasitc limestone or bioclasitc micrite; (2) residual bioclasitc textures developed in mesocrystalline-macrocrystallinpore dolomites and bioclast-dissolved pores partly filled with authigenic quartz and saddle dolostone mostly with intergranular and corroded pores, which porosity averages between 6%and 10%; (3) an obviously higher homogenization temperature of dolomite matrix (125~178°C) than the stratum temperature during dolomitization, which is indicated by more negative oxygen isotopes (-10.1‰~-11.42‰), higher

84882276763	Similarities and differences between natural gas accumulations in Sulige gas field in Ordos basin and Xujiahe gas field in Central Sichuan Basin	Both Sulige gas field in the Ordos Basin and Xujiahe gas field in Central Sichuan Basin are large low-porosity and low-permeability gas fields composed of conventional gas reservoirs and unconventional gas accumulations, representing typical cases of low-grade natural gas accumulations in China. Studies show there are both similarities and differences between these two fields in terms of forming conditions, mechanism and distribution. The similarities include: (1) large-scale development of accumulation conditions and close source-reservoir contacts, providing basis for large-scale accumulations; (2) large-scale energy storage during source kitchen burial and large-scale gas expulsion during uplift, providing important conditions for large-scale natural gas accumulation; (3) coexisting volume flow and diffusion flow, giving rise to the co-existence of conventional gas reservoirs and unconventional gas accumulations; and (4) clustered lithologic gas accumulations on a large scale. The differences lie in: (1) different source-reservoir-seal assemblages, giving birth to two kinds of accumulations, i.e. large area accumulations and large-scale patchy accumulations; (2) different source kitchen continuity and gas supply potentials, leading to different enriched gas-bearing layer series and different abundances. Timely understanding of the similarities and differences between large-scale natural gas accumulations with low porosity and permeability in these two basins would be conducive to avoid risks and improve exploration success ratio and benefits. © 2013 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

84883390628	Understanding tight oil reservoir hydraulic fracturing stimulation using two wells simultaneous microseismic monitoring approach	The tight sand oil reservoir found in the Ordos basin is known for its very low porosity and permeability. Almost every well has been stimulated using hydraulic fracturing techniques. The average production for a vertical well is approximately 4-5 tons per day. Among such a large number of fracture jobs, enhanced production after stimulation does not always meet expectations. Since 2005, hydraulic fracturing monitoring services have been carried out widely in this field to improve fracture geometry understanding and optimize well placement. With the implementation on-site, real-time hydraulic fracture monitoring, the pumping procedure can be adjusted accordingly based on the mapped microseismic events. Based on the past hydraulic fracturing monitoring experience in this field, an average microseismic event detectable distance range around 300 m is expected for the case of geophones inside a monitor well. Two parallel horizontal wells were thus drilled at 600m apart. Horizontal section length is around 1,500m for both wells. The original hydraulic fracture plans for each well consisted of 18 stage stimulations, but were subsequently adjusted to 13 stages based on real-time hydraulic fracture monitoring results. Three monitoring wells were drilled from toe to heel as shown in Figure 1. These monitor wells will also be used as water injection wells in later secondary recovery processes. So hydraulic fractures generated by the pumping from both horizontal wells are not expected to extend far enough to reach the monitor wells. With this favorable well layout, simultaneous dual-well hydraulic fracture monitoring was proposed and conducted. In order to obtain the optimized fracturing parameters first, the initial 3 stages of each treatment well was conducted at one stage per well i.e. stimulate well-1 and then move to frac well-2. Simultaneous hydraulic fracturing began after the initial six stages were completed. Copyright © 2013 International Petroleum Technology Conference.

84888098873	A research on carbonate karst reservoirs classification and its implication on hydrocarbon exploration: Cases studies from tarim basin	Karst reservoirs were very important explorational target in China marine hydrocarbon-bearing basins. Based on the eases studies of karst reservoir from Tarim basin, it could be concluded that porespace, which was mainly composed of vug, cavern and solution fissure with different geological background and origins, could distributed in the area of carbonate hills and carbonate interstratum. According to the distribution of porespace, karst reservoirs could be divided into four types, in which, buried hill (weathering crust) karst reservoir could be divided into two subtypes as limestone buried hill karst reservoir and dolomite crust karst reservoir. Buried hill (weathering crust) karst reservoirs developed in area of buried carbonate hill which were related to mid-long term angle uncomformity with intensive terrain relief while interstratum karst reservoir and bedding karst reservoir developed in area of interstratum with minor terrain relief. Interstratum karst reservoir was related to short-mid disconformity within carbonate sequence with bedded distributional characteristics while bedding karst reservoir was related to slope geological background with circle-rimmed distributional characteristics around carbonate hill. Fault-related karst reservoir mainly developed in area of interstratum, especially in the core of anticline and porespace developed along fault. Tradditional karst reservoirs give the way to the subdivision of karst reservoirs which expand the explorational realm for karst reservoirs. The explorational realm has been stretched from carbonate hill into carbonate interstratum which would play important roles for hydrocarbon exploration in China marine carbonate basins.

84900480243	Petroleum geological features and exploration prospect in deep marine carbonate strata onshore China: A further discussion	Deep marine facies carbonate reservoirs have become one of the important succession regions of China onshore oil and gas exploration and development, so such exploration and geological research in this field is of realistic significance to the sustainable, steady and smooth development in oil and gas sector in China. Therefore, through a deep investigation into the fundamental geological conditions of deep marine carbonate reservoirs, we found that such resource potential is great and far beyond the expectation, so there is a great prospect for such great discoveries as giant oil or gas fields. The following findings were obtained. First, there are two kinds of hydrocarbon kitchens, which were respectively formed by conventional source rocks and liquid hydrocarbons cracking that were detained in source rocks, and both of them could provide large-scale hydrocarbons. Second, the petrophysical properties of carbonate reservoirs are immune from their buried depth due to the bedding and interstratal karst, as well as the burial and hydrothermal dolomitization, so effective carbonate reservoirs could be extensively developed in the deep and ultra-deep strata. Third, parts of marine source rocks could form hydrocarbon accumulations spanning important tectonic phases under the coupling effects of progressive burial and annealing geothermal field, and liquid hydrocarbons could be kept in ultra-deep strata over 7000 meters meaning that not only gas pools but also oil pools could be found in deep marine strata. Fourth, large-scale uplifts were formed by the stacking of multi-episodic tectonism and oil and gas could be accumulated through three types, i.e., downward invasion model, lift model and switching model. In addition, groups of stratigraphic and lithologic traps were widely developed in the areas of percline structure of paleouplifts and continental margins. In conclusion, large-scale fields could be formed in marine carbonate strata in onshore basins of China because of the above-mentioned advantages.

84902478329	Types, characteristics, origin and exploration significance of reef-shoal reservoirs: A case study of Tarim Basin, NW China and Sichuan Basin, SW China	Taking reef-shoal bodies developed in multiple formations in the Tarim Basin and Sichuan Basin as examples, this paper examines the origin of pores and heterogeneity of types of reef-shoal reservoirs, and tries to find out the distribution rules of various reef-shoal reservoirs. Reef-shoal reservoirs can be classified into two main types, i.e. biohermal reservoirs and grain shoal reservoirs. The former, related to reef framework, in the form of frilled platform margin, can be subdivided into interior platform reef complex and margin reef complex (sedimentary or tectonic origin). The latter, not related to reef framework, is controlled by the fluctuation of sea level on gentle slope carbonate platform, is widely developed on carbonate ramp due to the migration of shoal, and can be subdivided into interior platform shoal and platform-margin shoal on steep slopes. Reservoir space of reef-shoal carbonates was primarily formed during syngenetic and burial stages. Syngenetic porosity is controlled by original rock fabric and dissolution related to the exposure of sequence boundaries, while porosity development and distribution in burial stage is closely related to that in syngenetic stage, showing inherited features. Reef-shoal reservoirs are strongly heterogeneous, and complicated in effective reservoir distribution. Platform margin reef and biohermal shoal coexisting with reef on the top of shallowing upward sequence are main reservoirs rich in pores, the grain shoal deposited on top of shallowing upward cycle of isolated reef is also the main zone rich in pores, which usually interbeds with tight reservoir. Overall, grain shoal reservoirs are bigger in scale and better in physical properties than biohermal reservoirs.

84906445594	The porosity origin of dolostone reservoirs in the Tarim, Sichuan and Ordos basins and its implication to reservoir prediction	Origin of dolostone remained a controversial subject, although numerous dolomitization models had been proposed to date. Because of the dolomitization's potential to be hydrocarbon reservoirs, one debatable issue was the role of dolomitization in porosity construction or destruction. Based upon case studies of dolostone reservoirs in various geological settings such as evaporative tidal flat (Ordos Basin, NW China), evaporative platform (Sichuan Basin, SW China), and burial and hydrothermal diagenesis (Tarim Basin, NW China), here we systematically discuss the origin of porosity in dolostone reservoirs. Contrary to traditional concepts, which regarded dolomitization as a significant mechanism for porosity creation, we found two dominant factors controlling reservoir development in dolostones, i.e., porosity inherited from precursor carbonates and porosity resulted from post-dolomitization dissolution. Actually, dolomitization rarely had a notable effect on porosity creation but rather in many cases destroyed pre-existing porosity such as saddle dolostone precipitation in vugs and fractures. Porosity in dolostones associated with evaporative tidal flat or evaporative platform was generally created by subaerial dissolution of evaporites and/or undolomitized components. Porosity in burial dolostones was inherited mostly from precursor carbonates, which could be enlarged due to subsequent dissolution. Intercrystalline porosity in hydrothermal dolostones was either formed during dolo- mitization or inherited from precursor carbonates, whereas dissolution-enlarged intercrystalline pores and/or vugs were usually interpreted to be the result of hydrothermal alteration. These understandings on dolostone porosity shed light on reservoir prediction. Dolostone reservoirs associated with evaporative tidal flat were laterally distributed as banded or quasi-stratified shapes in evaporite-bearing dolostones, and vertically presented as multi-interval patterns on tops of shallowing-upward cycles. Dolostone reservoirs associated with evaporative platform commonly occurred along epiplatforms or beneath evaporite beds, and vertically presented as multi-interval patterns in dolostones and/or evaporite-bearing dolostones of reef/shoal facies. Constrained by primary sedimentary facies, burial dolostone reservoirs were distributed in dolomitized, porous sediments of reef/shoal facies, and occurred vertically as multi-interval patterns in crystalline dolostones on tops of shallowing-upward cycles. Hydrothermal dolomitization was obviously controlled by conduits (e.g., faults, unconformities), along which lenticular reservoirs could develop. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

12944305622	Characteristics of seismic attenuation of gas reservoirs in wavelet domain	Reliable estimates of the anelastic attenuation factor, Q , are desirable for improvement of resolution through inverse Q filter and to facilitate amplitude analysis. This paper derives an energy attenuation formula of seismic waves in the wavelet-scale domain from the wavelet theory and seismic wave propagation equation in anelastic medium. The energy attenuation formula has the following features: (1) The larger Q is, the more slowly the energy attenuates; and the smaller Q is, the faster the energy attenuates. (2) The smaller scale, the less the energy involving in signal. (3) The energy of a signal on different scales is equal while the impulse source propagates in an ideal elastic medium (i.e. Q = ∞). The energy attenuation formula can be used to estimate the quality factor Q from surface seismic data and to extract energy attenuation section of varied scales as an attribute parameter for discriminating fluid contents and lithology. It avoids window problems that the classic spectral ratio method encounter. Theoretical model experiments show the correctness and effectivity of this method.
