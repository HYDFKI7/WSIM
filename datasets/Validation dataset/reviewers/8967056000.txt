In this paper, we propose an energy effective distributed multisensor target detection method, which is different from the existing single sensor target detection methods, and target is detected by multisensor cooperation scheme. The first algorithm presents a method of the time series discretization to solve the distance of the target detected by the first connected node. The detected information is aggregated in the aggregating node, and the optimal path by the second algorithm is built up to transmit the aggregated packets to the sink. According to the simulation results, the probability of the single node target detection is compared with that of the multisensor collaborative target detection, and the influence of the weight coefficient on average node energy consumption is analyzed.

24744448241	Selection algorithm for QoS routing based on K-shortest paths	Facing the problem of multiple constraint Quality of Service Routing (QoSR), a novel selection algorithm based on K shortest paths, QRBKP, was proposed. This algorithm calculated the K shortest paths first according to each constraint parameter. Then the QoSR satisfying multiple constraints was selected among all shortest paths with the value of k changing adaptively to the QoS constraints. Both intra-node-pair reassignment method and inter-node-pair reassignment method were proposed to assure the routing table space not out of the range of designed routing table space. Theoretical analysis shows QRBKP can solve QoSR not only with additive constraint parameters, but also with non-additive constraint parameters. Simulation results show that the routing computational success ratio of QRBKP is higher than that of current algorithms in solving QoSR under the same computational time.

First, the algorithm simplifies the RWA problem into a routing problem with a layered-graph model. Then, we search for routes for the routing problem. The ants used in our algorithm are transported in a control plane, so we can search for routes in the control plane and transport traffic in the data plane synchronously. And the route for a connection request can be determined in real-time. The hops and congestion of routes are also considered in our algorithm, so the blocking probability is reduced. Finally, we use different kinds of ants with the motivation of bandwidth differentiation so that the low bandwidth request traffic can use the key link and the high bandwidth request traffic selects a detour path, and therefore the blocking probability can also be reduced. Simulation results show that ADIR performs better than other routing approaches in terms of traffic blocking probability and traffic blocking fairness.

And the basic issue of sink mobility is deciding when and where to move the sink during network operation. In this paper, we have proposed a novel energy efficient strategy for single mobile sink in eventdriven sensor networks in which events occur infrequently, but continue for some time once they occur, such as fire, etc. The strategy is a heuristic geometric centre approach, and designed to respond properly to stochastic events that have uncertainty in their positions, area sizes, occurrence times and durations. As a result, energy consumption is reduced and network lifetime is improved. In the strategy, a quasi-optimal position for the sink is obtained considering distances from the sink to the sensors which are in event areas when one/more event(s) arises or terminates. And then the sink moves to the position. We compare our strategy with traditional strategies for single mobile sink by simulations.

The algorithm maximizes the possible data aggregation by building and updating a Hop-Tree, takes the local state of nodes to build and maintain Hop-Tree to gain better adaptation to heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, depends on Time-To- Live (TTL) mechanism to limit the Hop-Tree update range to avoid over-overlapping of paths according to the correlation of events, and designs a forced path building strategy to balance the data load on the backbone nodes of Hop-Tree to further balance the energy consumption. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our algorithm can maximize the possible data aggregation while balance the energy consumption among nodes and enhance the monitoring ability of WSNs significantly.

84883341085	A dynamic routing algorithm for data-aggregation optimization in event-driven wireless sensor networks	In order to optimize the total energy consumption of data collection for wireless sensor networks, we study how to route data for improving data aggregation efficiency and propose a dynamic routing algorithm for data-aggregation optimization in event-driven wireless sensor networks. It clusters nodes within event areas in a distributed manner with low control overhead and establishes an approximate Steiner tree based on events aided by the sum of Euclidean distances from nodes to cluster heads. The algorithm does not only improve the data aggregation ratio but also decreases the control overhead for building and maintaining routing structure, achieving energy-efficient data routing and collection and promoting network performance eventually. Algorithm analysis and experiments show that the algorithm can effectively decrease the amount of transmissions for both data and control packet, prolonging network lifetime.

84891913011	Energy-efficient boundary node selection algorithm based on target detection	The target detection is a kind of very important application in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents an energy efficient distributed boundary node selection (DBNS) algorithm. The boundary nodes (BN) are selected distributively, starting from the Sink node at the edge of the monitoring area. Then, the candidate nodes are screened to guarantee the effectiveness of the boundary node selection. In the target detection process, when the target enters the monitoring area, the boundary nodes send messages to the adjacent nodes, and record the entry time and entry position; and the target tracking is realized through the node response mechanism. Simulation experiment results indicate that compared with other boundary node selection algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better performances in the number of boundary nodes, the average number of data packets, the time of target detection and the node residual energy.

84896479922	The degree-constrained adaptive algorithm based on the data aggregation tree	In the PEDAP algorithm, a minimum spanning tree considering the energy consumption is established based on the Kruskal algorithm, and updated every 100 rounds. There exists a defect that the energy of some nodes rapidly expires because the degrees of nodes differ significantly, and the delay time is not considered. Based on the above analysis, a new algorithm called DADAT (a Degree-based Adaptive algorithm for Data Aggregation Tree) is proposed. The energy consumption and the delay time are both considered, and a weight model to construct a minimum spanning tree is established. Furthermore, the node degree on the tree is readjusted according to the average degree of the network, and nodes are labeled by red, yellow, and green colors according to their remaining energy; the child nodes of the red nodes are adaptively transferred to their neighbor nodes which are labeled as green. Finally, we discuss the weight and the update rounds' impact on the network lifetime. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively balance the energy consumption and prolong the lifetime of the network, as well as achieving a lower latency. Â© 2014 Xiaogang Qi et al.

84896809245	Distributed malicious nodes detection in wireless sensor networks	Data theft and node attack in wireless sensor networks causes great damage to the networks and the attacker destroys network and obtains the data of the network by malicious nodes distributed in the network. Therefore, it is necessary to detect these malicious nodes and to eliminate their influence. We propose a distributed malicious nodes detection protocol which called BMND based on Bayesian voting, every node determine its suspected malicious nodes by its request message and abnormal behavior. Also, we determine the malicious nodes by Bayesian voting, so that the network can protect itself from such malicious nodes' influence. The simulation results show that our algorithm has good performance in both the detection rate and false positive rate. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

In this paper, based on small-world and scale-free concepts of complex network theory and considering the characteristics of wireless sensor network, a topology model with small-world and scale-free concepts for heterogeneous sensor network is presented. This work is achieved by applying heterogeneous sensors and preferential attachment mechanism. Furthermore, the topology evolution algorithm is designed. Finally, we simulate the network characteristics, and simulation results are consistent with the theoretic analysis and show that topologies of wireless sensor network built by this model have small-world and scale-free feathers and can significantly improve energy efficiency as well as enhance network robustness, leading to a crucial improvement of network performance.

84914146458	Analysis on resilience of wireless sensor networks growth model	Resilience has become one of the most important indicators in evaluating the topological structure of wireless sensor networks. How to construct a robust topology of WSNs is even more important. Based on complex networks theory, a topology evolution model-DEDA, which considers the node degree, the remaining energy and the transmission distance, is proposed. Some resilience metrics are introduced to analyze the resilience of WSNs and computer simulations are performed to compare the resilience of several topologies that are generated with different growth models. The experimental results show that DEDA model provides better resilience against both random and deliberate attacks.
