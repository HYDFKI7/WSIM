0031909481	Screening of depression in patients with chronic medical diseases in a primary care setting	Background. Patients with chronic medical diseases may have depression that is not recognized by their primary care physicians. Objectives. We aimed to examine the application of Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) in the screening of depression in primary care patients with chronic medical diseases in a Chinese population. Methods. We studied 268 patients with chronic medical diseases in the Family Medicine Outpatient Clinic using a structured questionnaire including basic demographic data, a Chinese version of the SDS and a rating for the self-perceived severity of physical condition. The severity of chronic medical diseases was assessed by the authors using the Duke University Severity of Illness Scale from a chart audit. Fifty patients were randomly selected for a diagnostic interview according to the DSM-IV criteria. The construct validity and internal consistency reliability, sensitivity and specificity of the SDS were examined. Results. The results revealed that the SDS has good construct validity and internal consistent reliability in the evaluation of depression in Chinese patients with chronic medical diseases. A cut-off point of 55 had a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 90.0%. Depressed patients reported more cognitive symptoms than depressed affect and physical symptoms. Female patients had more severe depressed affect than male patients, but males had more prominent diurnal variation of mood than females. Conclusions. We concluded that SDS can be a good screening tool for depression in Chinese patients with chronic medical diseases. Owing to constraints in the expression of sexual desire in the Chinese, elderly subjects tended to report loss of libido in the response to the SDS.

0031969917	Stress-reducing effect of physician's tape-recorded support on cardiac surgical patients in the intensive care unit	Staying in an intensive care unit (ICU) is very stressful for patients after heart surgery. Although it is a general belief that support from doctors is important to reduce patients' tension, no quantitative data are available. We investigated the stress-reducing effects of a tape-recorded message from the physician which provided information regarding the surgery and emotional support for heart surgery patients postoperatively in the ICU. Sixty patients who underwent cardiac surgery were randomly allocated to two equal groups. The patients in the experimental group listened to a tape- recorded message from their attending surgeon soon after they recovered from anesthesia, while the control group rested during the study period. The effectiveness of the tape-recorded support program was evaluated by the influence on heart rate, blood pressure, and finger skin temperature, as well as the degree of subjective pain, tension, anxiety, depression, and anger. The pain and tension levels of the patients were measured using a visual analogue scale, while the severity of anxiety, depression, and anger was evaluated using the Brief Symptom Rating Scale. Patients' evaluation of the usefulness of the program was also assessed. After listening to the physician's recorded message, the mean increase in the skin finger temperature in the experimental group was higher than in the control group (0.44 °C, p = 0.0513). The experimental group had significant decreases in their mean scores of pain (-1.11 vs 0.36, p = 0.0043), tension((-2.26 vs - 0.25, p = 0.0001), anxiety (-1.3 vs 0.57, p = 0.0473), and depression (-2.24 vs -0.37, p = 0.0253). The patients showed a high needed for this support program (mean need score 8.4). These findings show that a physician's tape- recorded message providing information and emotional support can reduce stress in heart surgery patients in the ICU postoperatively.

33645278405	Outcome of short-term hospitalization in a psychosomatic ward	Background and Purpose: This study investigated the short-term outcome of patients with common mental disorders (CMDs) admitted to a psychosomatic ward. Multidimensional outcome measurements were used, including psychological symptoms, global functioning, and service satisfaction. Methods: A total of 56 consecutive patients with CMDs admitted to a 33-bed psychosomatic ward for crisis intervention or due to refractory conditions unresponsive to treatment at outpatient clinics were enrolled. Structured measurements including psychological symptoms, personality traits, family functioning and global functioning, at admission and discharge, were used to assess outcome. Baseline social functioning was measured at admission. Perspective on life satisfaction and satisfaction with therapy were assessed at discharge. Univariate analysis and multiple regression models that employed the stepwise method were used to determine the predictors of outcome. Results: Psychological symptoms, global functioning and family function demonstrated significant improvement after hospitalization (p<0.05). Personality traits remained stable during hospitalization. Baseline social functioning, educational level, marital status, comorbid mental disorder, length of hospital stay, and neuroticism were significantly associated with psychological stress at discharge (adjusted R

33645306348	Validity of the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale among subjects admitted for general health screening	Background and Purpose: Hospital-based general health screening plays an important role in the early detection of mental disorders. The present study examined the validity of the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) in subjects admitted for a 2-day general health screening program. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a modified 2-phase design was conducted at a medical center in Taipei. A total of 283 consecutive subjects who received health screening in a 1-month period completed the BSRS-5 in the first phase. There were 172 (60.8%) males and 111 (39.2%) females with a mean age of 54.4±12.0 years. 115 subjects received a standard psychiatric interview with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus in the second phase. Results: In this hospital-based sample, the internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) coefficient for the BSRS-5 was 0.84 and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.91 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-0.95]. The optimal cut-off point was 5/6. The rate of accurate classification was 82.2% (82.6% sensitivity, 81.8% specificity, 81.9% positive predictive value, 82.5% negative predictive value). The estimated prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity in this sample was 27.2% (95% CI, 22.2-32.4%). Conclusion: The BSRS-5 is an effective screening instrument for the identification of psychiatric morbidity in hospital-based health screening settings.

33745890897	A programme of symptom management for improving quality of life and drug adherence in AIDS/HIV patients	Aim. This paper reports an evaluation of the effect of symptom management programmed on drug adherence, CD4 count and virus load and the quality of life of patients with HIV/AIDS. Background. Patients with HIV/AIDS have to face the long-term side effects caused by highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens. There has been little research to evaluate the influence of drug intervention side effects on self-care. Methods. Sixty-seven patients with HIV/AIDS were randomly assigned to one-on-one teaching, group teaching, or control groups. All those in the one-on-one and group teaching groups attended a symptom management programme once a week, followed by 3 weeks of continuity and telephone counselling. Those in the control group were offered experimental intervention at the conclusion of data collection. The Customized Adherence Self-Report Questionnaire, CD4 count and virus load, and Quality of Life Index were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the symptom management programme before and at 3 months after the intervention. Results. Median differences on the Customized Adherence Self-Report Questionnaire, CD4 count and virus load, and quality of life in both experimental groups were statistically significantly better than in the control group. Conclusions. The symptom management programme can increase self-care ability in managing medication side effects in patients with HIV/AIDS. © 2006 The Authors.

33845690304	The strategy and prospects of suicide prevention in Taiwan	Suicide mortality rates have been steadily rising in Taiwan, and suicide has been among the top ten causes of death for the last consecutive eight years. In response to this situation, the Taiwan Department of Health assigned the Taiwan Association Against Depression the task of setting up the Taiwan Suicide Prevention Center. The mission of the Center, suicide prevention, is advanced by its establishment of efficient networks nationwide capable of delivering related care services. Suicide prevention strategies can be categorized, based on coverage, as universal, selective or indicated interventions. The Center also plans to standardize the national suicide report format and care delivery system, improve mental health service quality, and organize community support networks. It pursues an encompassing health care mechanism model, where clients are considered the first priority, the family a fundamental supporting unit, and the community a solid foundation. The Center will offer a helping hand for individuals who have attempted suicide by maintaining a spirit of positive values and achieving mutual benefits.

34548686140	Effects of electromyography biofeedback-assisted relaxation on pain in patients with advanced cancer in a palliative care unit	Most patients with advanced cancer experience pain. However, many cancer patients do not find satisfaction with conventional treatment of pain relief. This study examined the effect of electromyography (EMG) biofeedback-assisted relaxation on cancer-related pain in advanced cancer patients. We hypothesized that changes in EMG activity in frontal muscles underlie the efficacy of EMG biofeedback-assisted relaxation. This was a randomized control study. The experimental group (n = 12) received 6 EMG biofeedback-assisted relaxation sessions over a 4-week period, whereas the control group (n = 12) received conventional care. The primary efficacy measure was the level of pain, measured by the Brief Pain Inventory. Findings from this study show that relaxation training supplemented with visual and auditory EMG biofeedback signals is effective in reducing cancer-related pain in advanced cancer patients, possibly through a mechanism of attenuation of physiological arousal. Electromyography biofeedback-assisted relaxation training may be used along with medications for effective pain management in patients with advanced cancer. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34547690790	Two-phase survey of eating disorders in gifted dance and non-dance high-school students in Taiwan	Background. Despite a growing body of literature reporting eating disorders (EDs) in non-Western countries in recent years, most of these studies are limited to questionnaire-based surveys or caseseries studies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of EDs in Taiwanese high-school students. Methods. The study subjects consisted of all the female high-school students enrolled in the gifted dance class in 2003 in Taiwan (n=655) and non-dance female students randomly chosen from the same school (n=1251). All the participants were asked to complete self-report questionnaires, including the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) and the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE). All the screen positives and an approximate 10% random sample of the screen negatives were then interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders Patient Version (SCID-I/P). Results. The prevalence of individual EDs was much higher in the dance [0.7% for anorexia nervosa (AN), 2.5% for bulimia nervosa (BN) and 4.8% for EDs, not otherwise specified (EDNOS)] than in the non-dance (0.1, 1.0 and 0.7% respectively) students. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that being in the dance class, higher concern about body shape and lower family support were correlates of EDs for all students, whereas lower parental education level was associated with EDs only for non-dance students. Conclusion. EDs were more prevalent in the weight-concerned subpopulation. Although AN is still rare, BN has emerged as a comparable prevalent disorder in Taiwan, as in Western countries. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

37349113397	Predictors of treatment response and length of stay for inpatients with major depression	Background/purpose: Depressive illness is highly recurrent, frequently chronic and associated with a high level of functional disability. Studies have shown that depression combined with anxiety is the most common reason for admission worldwide. This study aimed to examine the variables associated with treatment response or length of stay (LOS) among a group of inpatients with major depression. Methods: The attending psychiatrist rated severity of depression (using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, HAM-D) of the patients (n = 67), and the patients were asked to complete several self-rating scales (including the Beck Depression Inventory, BDI) on admission. Three days before discharge, these assessments were repeated. Logistic regression models were used to examine the variables of remission status (defined by the HAM-D or the BDI) and LOS (dichotomized by a median of 25 days), respectively. Results: The remission rates of depression at discharge defined by the HAM-D (≤7) and the BDI (≤8) were 40% and 16%, respectively. Lower socioeconomic status and less clinical severity at admission were associated with clinicians' objective assessment of remission, while suicide attempt during this index episode was associated with patients' subjective remission. LOS of depressive inpatients was neither related to baseline severity nor to remission status at discharge. Patients with positive family history and more frequent hospitalization were associated with a hospital stay of longer than 25 days. Conclusion: There was no evidence to show that patients with a long hospital stay would gain treatment benefits over patients with short stay. This study provides evidence to support that a structured inpatient treatment plan might gain some economic benefits without compromising treatment efficacy. The admission of hospitalization repeaters should be managed optimally based on the considerations of treatment efficacy and its impact on longer hospital stay. © 2007 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

39549088087	Obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a manifestation of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus	Neuropsychiatric syndrome is a common and serious clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurring in about half of all patients during the course of the disease. We report here a case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms as an unusual manifestation of neuropsychiatric SLE. A 17-year-old girl with SLE was admitted to a medical center with the chief complaint of recent-onset repeated doubt and repetitive checking, which subsided after treatment. She had recurrent and intrusive doubt about losing her belongings and tried to suppress the thoughts by mental acts of praying and repetitive checking. The central nervous system lupus involvement in this patient was confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed widespread areas of abnormal high signal intensity over the internal capsules and basal ganglia, and focal lesions at the peripheral parenchyma of the frontal and parietal areas. Single photon emission computed tomography also showed decreased perfusion at the left temporal lobe. This supported the hypothesis that basal ganglia abnormalities could be the common pathophysiology of coexisting obsessive-compulsive symptoms and SLE. Moreover, increased awareness of hidden psychopathology, an accepting attitude, and careful probing for obsessive-compulsive symptoms are important while taking care of SLE patients. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

40749142032	Determinants of suicidal ideation in Taiwanese urban adolescents	Background/Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to examine the determinants of adolescent suicidal ideation in Taiwanese urban adolescents. Methods: A descriptive and correlational study design was used. A sample of 2341 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years in middle and high school was recruited for this study. Data were collected between January 2005 and July 2007. Instruments used included the Children's Depression Inventory, the Cognitive Triad for Children, the Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation, the Life Event Checklist, and the revised Daily Hassle Scale. Results: Approximately 51% of the adolescents were identified as belonging to the high-risk group and needed further assessment for at-risk suicidal ideation. Specifically, 51.6% and 50.7% of the adolescents in middle and high schools, respectively, were-identified as belonging to the high-risk groups. Results revealed that type of school, depressive symptoms, cognitive triad, and daily hassles significantly predicted adolescent suicidal ideation. Middle school students were likely to report a greater amount of suicidal ideation. Students with higher levels of depressive symptoms, negative cognitive triad and daily hassles tended to have more suicidal thoughts. The best predictor was the negative cognitive triad (β=-0.43, p < 0.001) followed by depressive symptoms (β = 0.35, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Results from this study have important implications for identifying high-risk suicidal adolescent groups and for furthering suicide prevention work. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

58149296046	Risk factors for suicide in Taiwanese college students	The authors investigated the personality characteristics, psychopathology, parenting style, and family function among Taiwanese college students with high, moderate, and low suicidal risks. Participants: The sample included 2,919 first-year college students (1,414 men, 1,505 women) from a university in Taipei, Taiwan. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire assessed domains covering demographics, personality, psychopathology, frequency of substance use, parenting style, family functioning, and suicidal behaviors. The authors used mixed models for data analysis. Results: The authors observed a positive linear trend between increased suicidal tendency and levels of neuroticism, harm avoidance, novelty seeking, psychopathology, and parenting styles of low affection, overprotection, and authoritarian controlling. Use of tobacco and alcohol and impaired family adaptation and cohesion were associated with high and moderate suicidal risks. Conclusions: Personality, psychopathology, substance use, and familial factors are important correlates of suicidal risks among college students in Taiwan. Optimal suicide prevention strategies in the college setting should incorporate the multiple facets of suicidal risks. © 2008 Heldref Publications.

59149096081	Non-psychiatric physicians' knowledge, attitudes and behavior toward depression	Background/Purpose: Depression is a major health concern, often treated by non-psychiatrists. This study assessed self-reported knowledge, attitudes and treatment practices of non-psychiatric physicians in the recognition and management of depression. Methods: Survey questionnaires were given to non-psychiatric physicians who attended a depression training program. We asked physicians about their current clinical practice, knowledge, confidence, attitudes and perceived barriers to care regarding recognition and management of patients with depression. Results: Of 524 eligible non-psychiatric physicians, 375 (72%) completed surveys. The majority of physicians held a strong sense of responsibility for managing depression, although they provided treatment to only a small proportion of depressed patients. Most of them were not confident treating depressed patients, and they reported that incomplete knowledge and training were major barriers that limited their involvement. The patient and organization barriers were not related to reported management, but the physician barriers (lack of skills and knowledge in managing depression) were related to reported rate of treatment. Age, prior depression training, and education were major contributing factors to domains of knowledge, attitude and behavior, in terms of the number of domains involved. Family physician orientation was associated with higher score on knowledge scale, but not with other variables of attitude and behavior. Conclusion: Our study suggests that non-psychiatrists may also play a role in the care of depression, but identifying and managing depression can be a challenge to them. Attitudinal barriers, confidence, and knowledge of treatment may compromise the physician's ability to manage depression. Future interventions and educational efforts need to address each of these issues. ©2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

79951947362	The relationship between pre-sleep arousal and spontaneous arousals from sleep in subjects referred for diagnostic polysomnograms	Background: To explore the relationship between pre-sleep arousability and spontaneous arousals from sleep, we conducted a cross-sectional study. Methods: Four hundred and four outpatients with suspected sleep-disordered breathing who had received diagnostic polysomnograms were enrolled. Spontaneous arousals from sleep were identified by electroencephalogram and scored according to the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Pre-sleep arousals were evaluated with the Pre-sleep Arousal Scale. Results: After controlling for confounders, the Cognitive subscale was correlated with spontaneous arousal indices during non-rapid eye movement sleep (b = 0.41, p= 0.01). Among patients with apnea-hypopnea index <. 40/hour, a relationship between the Cognitive subscale and spontaneous arousal indices was found during both non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep. In contrast, among patients whose apnea-hypopnea index was ≥. 40/hour, this relationship was not present (b = 0.25, p= 0.35). Conclusion: Pre-sleep cognitive hyperarousal is associated with increasing spontaneous arousals from sleep. Severity of sleep-disordered breathing may modulate this relationship. © 2011.

84908545211	Effectiveness of interactive discussion group in suicide risk assessment among general nurses in Taiwan: A randomized controlled trial	The evidence of suicide prevention training for nurses is scarce. Strategies to enhance general nurses' ability in suicide risk assessment are critical to develop effective training programs in general medical settings. This study was aimed to examine the effectiveness of an interactive discussion group in a suicide prevention training program for general nurses. In this randomized study with two groups of pre-post study design, the sample was recruited from the Medical, Surgical, and Emergency/Intensive Care Sectors of a 2000-bed general hospital via stratified randomization. Among the 111 nurses, 57 participants randomly assigned to the control group received a two-hour baseline suicide gatekeeper lecture, and 54 participants assigning to the experimental group received an additional five-hour group discussion about suicide risk assessment skills. Using a case vignette, the nurses discussed and assessed suicide risk factors specified in a 10-item Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale during a group discussion intervention. The findings revealed that the nurses achieved significant and consistent improvements of risk identification and assessment after the intervention without influencing their mental health status for assessing suicide risks. The result suggested an effective approach of interactive group discussion for facilitating critical thinking and learning suicide risk assessment skills among general nurses.

48849105155	The five-item Brief-Symptom Rating Scale as a suicide ideation screening instrument for psychiatric inpatients and community residents	Background: An efficient screening instrument which can be used in diverse settings to predict suicide in different populations is vital. The aim of this study was to use the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) as a screening instrument for the prediction of suicide ideation in psychiatric, community and general medical settings. Methods: Five hundred and one psychiatric, 1,040 community and 969 general medical participants were recruited. The community participants completed a structured telephone interview, and the other two groups completed the self-report BSRS-5 questionnaire. Results: The logistic regression analysis showed that the predictors of suicide ideation for the psychiatric group were depression, hostility and inferiority (p < 0.001, p = 0.016, p = 0.011), for the community group, inferiority, hostility and insomnia (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.003), and for the general medical group, inferiority, hostility, depression and insomnia (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.020, p = 0.008). The structural equation model showed the same symptom domains that predicted suicide ideation for all three groups. The receiver operating characteristic curve using the significant symptom domains from logistic regression showed that for the psychiatric group, the optimal cut-off point was 4/5 for the total of the significant dimensions (positive predictive value [PPV] = 78.01%, negative predictive value [NPV] = 79.05%), for the community group, 7/8 (PPV = 68.75%, NPV = 96.09%), and for the general medical group, 12/13 (PPV = 92.86%, NPV = 88.48%). Conclusion: The BSRS-5 is an efficient tool for the screening of suicide ideation-prone psychiatric inpatients, general medical patients, and community residents. Understanding the discriminative symptom domains for different groups and the relationship between them can help health care professionals in their preventative programs and clinical treatment. © 2008 Lung and Lee; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

4944221568	A program of symptom management for improving self-care for patients with HIV/AIDS	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a symptom management program on self-care of medication side effects among AIDS/HIV-positive patients. Sixty-seven patients from a sexually transmitted disease control center, a medical center, and a Catholic AIDS support group in Taipei were randomly assigned to three groups: one-on-one teaching, group teaching, and a control group. All subjects in each teaching group attended a 60- or 90-minute program on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) side effect self-care education and skill training once per week for 3 weeks; subjects also underwent counseling by telephone. A medication side effect self-care knowledge questionnaire, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and unscheduled hospital visits were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the symptom management program. The results revealed there were significant differences in mean difference of knowledge and unscheduled hospital visits between baseline and posttesting at 3 months for symptom management in the two groups. The mean difference of the self-esteem scale was not significant between the two groups. In summary, the symptom management program effectively increased the ability of AIDS/HIV-positive patients to self-care for medication side effects. We recommend that this program be applied in the clinical nursing practice.

54949103234	Towards an e-Health system for suicide prevention	Electronic health (e-Health) is an emerging research field that focuses on healthcare based in emerging information and communication technologies. Researchers on e-Health have been working on database management systems to store and retrieve electronically the health records, conducting e-referral of the patients, e-transferring of the patient information and helping several other sectors of a hospital management system (e.g. finance, pharmacy etc). This paper examines the problem of e-Health system development for mental illnesses that may lead to suicides. We propose a Decision Support System (DSS) that is able to mine complex real-world data of suicidal patients based on evolving knowledge engineering techniques. Evidence-based suicidal scenarios are analyzed using statistical modeling to mine knowledge. Finally the performance of the DSS is tested on some test data.

54449093708	Parental characteristics, parenting style, and behavioral problems among Chinese children with Down syndrome, their siblings and controls in Taiwan	Background/Purpose: The literature has documented maternal distress and behavioral problems among children with Down syndrome (DS), however, little is known about paternal adjustment and behavioral problems among the siblings of children with DS. Here, we examined parental psychopathology, parenting style and emotional/behavioral problems among children with DS, their siblings, and controls in Taiwan. Methods: We recruited 45 families of children with DS (age, 2-14 years) and 50 families of normally developing children (age, 3-15 years). If there were more than two children in the case family, the sibling whose age was closest to the child with DS was recruited (age, 3-18 years). Both parents completed self-administered measures of their personality characteristics, psychopathology, family functioning parenting styles, and child behavioral problems, using the Chinese versions of the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Brief Symptom Rating Scale, Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale, Parental Bonding Instrument, and Child Behavioral Checklist, respectively. Results: Children with DS demonstrated significantly more severe symptoms than normal children of a wide range of behavioral problems such as attention problems, delinquency, social problems, somatic complaints, thought problems, and withdrawal compared with the other two groups, and obtained similar parental treatment, except for paternal overprotection. Their parents suffered from more psychopathology and their mothers were less often employed than their counterparts. The siblings of children with DS obtained less overprotection from their mothers than children with DS and less maternal care and control than normal children. There was no difference in emotional/behavioral problems between the siblings and normal controls. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that in addition to the physical, educational and psychological needs of children with DS, the psychological care of their mothers, fathers and siblings also needs to be-evaluated. Moreover, parenting counseling should focus not only on children with DS, but their siblings as well. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

56349162674	Charcoal burning and maternal filicide-suicide trends in Taiwan: The impact of accessibility of lethal methods	Charcoal burning has emerged as a novel suicide method in Taiwan and its impact on maternal filicide-suicide (MFS) remains unexplored. Using official national mortality data and reports of MFS cases from electronic newspaper archives, the authors aimed to examine whether the newly available charcoal burning was associated with an increase in MFS incidents during the period from 1999 to 2006. The trends for changes in age/gender/method-specific suicide rates and MFS incidence were analyzed and then correlated with each other. The results indicated that charcoal burning was the leading method of filicide in reported MFS incidents. The increase in MFS incidents paralleled that of charcoal burning-specific suicide rates in females aged 25-44 years, while suicide rates by other methods did not change significantly. Easy accessibility and perceived painlessness as conveyed by the media might account for the choices of charcoal burning for MFS. Restricting access to charcoal burning should therefore be prioritized for further prevention strategies. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

5644235777	A review of the legislative mechanisms available to protect the social participation rights of people with depression in the Asia Pacific region	Objective: To conduct a review of the legislative mechanisms potentially available to protect the social participation rights of people with depression in the Asia Pacific region. Methods: Questions were sent to the SEBoD International Advisory Board and Internet and legal database searches were conducted to supplement responses from advisors. Results: While it cannot be said that comprehensive antidiscrimination legislation in relation to disability exists in all countries in the Asia Pacific region, most countries have commenced the process. Many have implemented either human rights or antidiscrimination legislation and most have set up a Human Rights Commission to protect social participation rights and allow complaints to be lodged. Conclusions: This review highlighted the difference between legislation and practice. While many countries have enacted laws, insufficient resources have been committed to support the objectives to realise the protection of rights enshrined in legislation. Additionally, many people may not know that the laws exist or do not have the money or social supports to fight for their rights. Many countries, however, have commenced a concerted approach to tackling the larger issues and have developed comprehensive action plans to address the social participation rights of people with disability.

61649128411	The recognition of diagnosable psychiatric disorders in suicide cases' last medical contacts	Objective: The objective of this study is to examine physicians' awareness of diagnosable psychiatric disorders in suicide cases' last medical contacts (MCs). Materials and methods: The contact rates and proportions of both psychiatric and somatic diagnoses in a national cohort of suicide subjects (N=3468) in Taiwan seeking psychiatric or nonpsychiatric medical services within 1 month and 1 year preceding death were examined. Results: The overall rates of MCs were 72.6% within 1 month and 89.2% within 1 year preceding suicide. While around 99.9% of the suicide subjects who contacted psychiatrists within 1 month preceding death were diagnosed as having psychiatric disorders, only 19.7% of those visiting nonpsychiatric physicians had psychiatric diagnoses. Suicide subjects, however, frequently complained of somatic symptoms, for example, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache/dizziness and back problem during their contacts with nonpsychiatric physicians within 1 month preceding death. Conclusions: Despite the high rates of MCs preceding suicide, the majority of suicide subjects were not diagnosed. Emphasizing psychosomatic manifestations of psychiatric disorders in physician education programs may help enhance the awareness of psychiatric disorders/suicide risk in clinical settings. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

63049131823	Relationship between mental health and job satisfaction among employees in a medical center department of laboratory medicine	Background/Purpose: Mental disorders associated with insomnia, depression and anxiety are common in the community and the workplace. Many studies have found a close link between mental health and job satisfaction. The present study investigated the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and level of job satisfaction, as well as the relationship between psychological distress and job satisfaction and associated factors, among nonphysician employees of a laboratory medicine department at a university medical center. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive and correlational study design was used. The employees were recruited and asked to complete a set of questionnaires, including a five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) and a 40-item Job Satisfaction Questionnaire (JSQ-40). A total of 38 (26.21%) males and 107 (73.79%) females with a mean age of 40.80 ± 7.3 years completed the entire set of questionnaires. Results: The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity defined by the BSRS-5 was 34.33%, with insomnia ranking the highest (28.36%), followed by depression (25.37%), hostility (24.63%), anxiety (23.13%), and inferiority (20.15%). Job satisfaction global assessment scores on a scale of 0 to 100 indicated that most respondents were satisfied with their jobs. In general, subjects with more severe psychological distress reported lower levels of job satisfaction on five dimensions measured by the JSQ-40. Factors related to organizational communication were especially important in overall job satisfaction and severity of psychological distress. Conclusion: The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the workplace is high. The severity of psychological distress is negatively associated with job satisfaction. Early detection of psychiatric morbidity through self-administered screening questionnaires, as well as implementation of organizational mental-health promotion programs, is recommended to improve employees' mental health and job satisfaction. © 2009 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

64149131141	Individual and family correlates for cigarette smoking among Taiwanese college students	Objective: This college-based questionnaire survey aimed to explore the individual, family, and peer correlates for cigarette smoking among first-year college students. Method: The sample included 2918 first-year college students (males, 45.5%) recruited from a national university in Taiwan (participation rate, 79.1%). The participants reported on questions about various substances, attitudes toward substances, personality characteristics, psychopathology, suicidal behaviors, parenting style, family function and use of substances, and peer substance use. Results: There were 263 (9.0%; males, 70.6%) current smokers. Compared to nonsmokers, college smokers were more extraverted and neurotic, and showed less harm avoidance, and more novelty seeking in their personality. They had more hostile, somatic, depressive, paranoid, and psychotic symptoms in terms of psychopathology. Smokers were more likely to use other substances, and to have suicidal ideations, wishes, plans, and attempts. Smokers perceived lower family cohesion, less care from their fathers, and less overprotection from their mothers. They were more likely to have peers and family members who also smoked or used other substances. The most associated correlates were male sex, older age, other substance use, novelty seeking, suicidal ideation and attempts, sibling and peer substance use, a prosubstance attitude, and less maternal overprotection. Conclusions: Our findings support the association of cigarette use in Taiwanese young adults with several individual, family, and peer factors identified in Western studies. Intervention in cigarette use should be multifaceted, by taking its correlates and the concurrent psychopathology, use of substances, and suicidality into consideration. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

65549102875	Physician suicide in Taiwan, 2000-2008: Preliminary findings	Research regarding physician suicide in Taiwan is lacking. Using national physician insurance data from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2008, the present study aimed to explore the association between physicians' suicide and their characteristics, including age, sex, specialties, area of residence, hospital types, and suicide methods. The majority (53.1-70.6%) of suicide cases occurred among physicians in their 40s. More suicides were reported among physicians serving in the community, living in urban areas, and from specialties such as general practice, family practice, psychiatry, and surgery. The leading suicide methods were hanging/suffocation, drowning, jumping from heights, charcoal burning and drug poisoning. In conclusion, physicians committing suicide were likely to be in their 40s, to serve in the community and to live in urban areas. Future efforts should focus on exploring the causes and possible interventions for physician suicide. © 2009 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

68749110677	Suicidal risk evaluation using a similarity-based classifier	Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death in the world and it is showing an increasing trend. Suicide is preventable by early screening of the risks. But the risk assessment is a complex task due to involvement of multiple predictors, which are highly subjective in nature and varies from one case to another. Moreover, none of the available suicide intent scales (SIS) are found to be sufficient to evaluate the risk patterns in a group of patients. Given this scenario, the present paper applies similarity-based pattern-matching technique for mining suicidal risks in vulnerable groups of patients. At first, medical data of groups of suicidal patients have been collected and modeled according to Pierce's Suicide Intent Scale (PSIS) and then engineered using a JAVA-based pattern-matching tool that performs as an intelligent classifier. Results show that addition of more factors, for example, age and sex of the patients brings more clarity to identify the suicidal risk patterns. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

69949162064	Methods of suicide in different psychiatric diagnostic groups	Background: An important element in suicide risk assessment is the evaluation of the intended suicide method. This study aimed to compare suicide methods in different psychiatric diagnostic groups in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 12,391 adult suicide cases between 2000 and 2004, which were recorded in official death records, were linked to Taiwan's National Health Insurance data files. A descriptive study was conducted to compare methods of suicide across different psychiatric diagnostic groups. Results: The proportion of jumping suicide was particularly high in cases with more severe psychopathology. Compared to suicide victims without any history of psychiatric disease, the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of jumping suicide among schizophrenic, bipolar, and major depressive patients were 3.1 (95% CI: 2.6-3.7), 2.2 (95% CI: 1.8-2.7), and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.6-2.2), respectively. Charcoal burning was less frequently used by those with a history of psychiatric diagnosis. Limitations: It is difficult to determine the reliability and validity of the claim data. Information on non-fatal acts of self-harm is unavailable. Conclusions: Suicide victims with different psychiatric diagnoses vary in their choice of suicide methods. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

7044238455	Response of Taiwanese obese binge eaters to a hospital-based weight reduction program	Objective To investigate the characteristics and prevalence of binge eating among overweight Taiwanese and to determine the effect of binge eating on outcome of weight loss treatment. Methods One hundred and eighty-nine participants in a 12-week traditional weight-reduction program were classified on the basis of the Bulimic Investigation Test, Edinburgh (BITE) scores into binge eaters (≥20), subthreshold binge eaters (10-19), and nonbinge eaters (0-9). Results This study found a 15.9% prevalence of binge eating. The binge-eating groups (binge eaters and subthreshold binge eaters) were younger, had an earlier onset of obesity, and more psychological distress than nonbinge eaters. Differences in obesity treatment weight loss among binge eaters, subthreshold binge eaters, or nonbingers by last observation carried forward (LOCF) method were not significant. At the end of treatment, the subthreshold binge eaters had the greatest weight loss. Although their binge eating and mood significantly improved, binge eaters and subthreshold binge eaters still had significant pathology in eating behaviors at completion of the program. Conclusion Alternative treatment strategies focusing on disordered eating behaviors are needed to supplement standard dietary management of overweight treatment-seeking binge eaters. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

7044263122	Long-term outcome of bulimia nervosa in Taiwanese	Background and Purpose: Patients with bulimia nervosa (RN) often experience many associated psychiatric symptoms and behaviors other than disordered eating and body image disturbance. Follow-up studies showed a broad range of remission rates and few prognostic factors were consistently identified. This study examined the outcome of BN in Taiwanese patients using a broad scope of assessment methods. Methods: From January 1985 to August 1999, a total of 68 consecutive patients with BN who visited the Department of Psychiatry at National Taiwan University Hospital were identified by chart review and invited to participate. Forty five patients (66.2%) agreed to participate in the study and were invited back for a follow-up assessment. The follow-up assessments used both semi-structured interview and self-rating questionnaires. Results: The mean duration of follow-up was 4.7 ± 2.9 (2 to 15) years. One patient died of gradual weight loss and malnutrition during the follow-up period. Forty four percent of the patients (n = 20) had no signs of eating disorder at follow-up, while 56% of the patients (n = 25) still met the criteria for diagnosis of an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa, BN, and eating disorders not otherwise specified). The rate of crossover from BN to anorexia nervosa was 6.6% (n = 3). The illness persisted for more than 2 years in most of the patients (84.5%). Purging subtype of BN was the only predictor of the presence of an eating disorder diagnosis at follow-up. Conclusions: This study found a high percentage of Taiwanese patients with BN failed to recover from eating disorders on long-term follow-up. The need for attention to the chronic nature of BN should be emphasized by medical professionals managing these patients.

70350704938	The suitability of the BSRS-5 for assessing elderly who have attempted suicide and need to be referred for professional mental health consultation in a metropolitan city, Taiwan	Objectives: The goals of this study are to (1) investigate the prevalence of necessary referral for professional mental health consultation for elderly people who attempted suicide ("suicide-attempted") in Kaohsiung city, Taiwan during 2006-2007, (2) assess whether the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) can be used as an efficient screening instrument for assessing the probability of a second suicide attempt among the elderly, and (3) examine predictors of needing referral among the suicide-attempted. Methods: During the study period, 144 suicide-attempted elderly subjects were enrolled. Demographic data, BSRS-5, SAD PERSONS scale, and Medical Outcome Study Short Form-12 (MOS SF-12) data were collected by a trained semi-professional. The prevalence of necessary referrals for the suicide-attempted elderly was estimated, and the salient factors for their referral were evaluated with logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 109 participants out of the 144 recruited completed the questionnaires, giving a response rate of 75.7%. The prevalence of necessary referrals for professional mental health consultation was 33.9% (37/109). The significant predictors of needing referrals were lower scores for MCS (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.83-0.96), family discord (OR = 3.86; 95% CI = 1.17-12.75), and type of interviewee (OR = 4.97; 95% CI = 1.57-15.74). Conclusion: When the BSRS-5 is used to evaluate the referral of elderly patients who have attempted suicide for a professional mental health consultation, it is best to conduct in-person interviews to ask whether the elderly patient still has any suicidal ideation. In addition, evaluating quality of life and level of family discord may also be crucial for suicide prevention in the elderly. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

70450200714	Gender differences in healthcare service utilisation 1 year before suicide: National record linkage study	All suicides (n=12497) in Taiwan in 2001-2004 were identified from mortality records retrieved from the National Health insurance Database. Altogether, 95.1% of females and 84.9% of males had been in contact with healthcare services in the year before their death. Females received significantly more diagnoses of psychiatric disorders (48.0% v. 30.2%) and major depression (17.8% v. 7.4%) than males. Such differences were consistent across different medical settings where contact with hospital-based non-psychiatric physicians was as common as with general practitioners (GPs). However, diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were underdiagnosed in both genders.

71649107252	Suicide by charcoal burning in Taiwan, 1995-2006	Background: We sought to identify risk factors and trends that might underlie the greatly increased incidence of charcoal-burning suicide in Taiwan and to learn whether the increasing accessibility of a single suicide method can increase overall suicide rates. Methods: Data from a national mortality register for subjects who committed suicide during 2001 to 2006 and who were 15 years old or older when they died was analyzed. A review of available evidence and comparisons with historical cases were also performed. Results: From 1995 to 2006, 68% of suicides in Taiwan involved males, and suicide rates for men increased from 9.5 to 26.7 per 100,000 population; suicide rates for women rose from 5.6 to 11.7 per 100,000 population. The sex ratio (M:F) increased from 1.69:1 to 2.28:1. The greatest increase in suicide rates occurred among those 25-44 years of age. The incidence of charcoal-burning suicide was 0.22 per 100,000 in 1999 but reached 6.48 per 100,000 in 2006. Age, gender, marital status, and year of committing suicide were significant predictors for suicide by charcoal burning. This single suicide method accounted for 33.5% of suicide deaths in Taiwan in 2006. Limitations: The number of suicides by charcoal burning may be under- or overestimated, and life events of the suicide subjects were not analyzed. Conclusions: Romanticizing suicide by charcoal burning by the media and cultural influences may have contributed to the increased suicides. Prohibiting sale of charcoal in convenience stores, enforcing media guidelines, and setting up carbon monoxide detectors may help prevent suicide by charcoal burning. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77952322412	Predictors of carbon monoxide poisoning-induced delayed neuropsychological sequelae	Objective: Carbon monoxide poisoning (COP) commonly results in delayed neuropsychological sequelae (DNS). The aim of the article is to demonstrate the clinical characteristics and potential predictors of COP-induced DNS later. Method: Retrospective medical record review was performed for patients who had COP in the past year at a National Medical Center in Taiwan. Sixty patients with COP were registered during a one-year period. Fifty-six of them (93.3%) were COP because of suicide attempt. Patients with COP who have a complete medical record of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores were recruited. Multiple regression analysis was performed to search for the predictive factors of DNS. Results: Forty-three patients were recruited. Most had attempted suicide (93.0%) using CO, and thirteen developed DNS later. A longer duration of admission, more sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and positive findings in brain computed tomography (CT) scans were more often found in patients with DNS than those without DNS. The GCS and MMSE scores and positive findings in brain CT scans were associated with the development of DNS but COHb was not. Conclusions: Our results identified several potential predictors of DNS. This finding may help clinicians understand and treat COP patients efficiently. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77952106584	Psychiatric Morbidity in HIV-infected Male Prisoners	Background/Purpose: The seroincidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Taiwan has drastically increased since 2004, particularly among injection drug users and prisoners. The major purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence and correlates of psychiatric morbidity among HIV-infected male prisoners. Methods: In 2006, data were collected from all of HIV-infected male prisoners (n = 535) in seven prisons in Taiwan. This collection was performed using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire in group settings directed by our interviewers. Psychiatric morbidity was measured using the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale in 535 participants, which represented an 85% response rate. After excluding incomplete data, 479 participants were included in the analysis. Results: Psychiatric morbidity was present in 46% of participants. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that correlates of the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale defined cases included the following: being a recidivist, having poor self-rated health status, and having experienced psychiatric symptoms in one's lifetime (e.g. significant physical pain or discomfort, depression for 2 weeks or longer, serious anxiety or tension, trouble understanding, concentrating, or remembering, and serious thoughts of suicide), with a Nagelkerke R

77955491119	Population-based post-crisis psychological distress: An example from the SARS outbreak in Taiwan	Background/Purpose: As a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, the World Health Organization placed Taiwan on the travel alert list from May 21 to July 5, 2003. The aim of this study was to explore the post-crisis psychological distress among residents in Taiwan after the SARS epidemic. Methods: The target population consisted of a nationwide representative sample of residents aged ≥ 18 years. Data were collected using computer assisted telephone interview systems by stratified random sampling according to geographic area. The survey (n = 1278) was conducted in November 2003, about 4 months after resolution of the SARS crisis in Taiwan. The maximum deviation of sampling error at the 95% confidence level was ± 2.74%. Psychological distress was measured by a question related to subject's changes in perception of life, plus the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the correlation of psychological distress. Results: About 9.2% of the participants reported that their perceptions of life became more pessimistic following the SARS crisis. The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 11.7%. Major predictors of higher levels of pessimism after the SARS epidemic included demographic factors, perception of SARS and preparedness, knowing people or having personal experiences of SARS-related discrimination, and individual worries and psychiatric morbidity. The correlates of symptomatic cases, as indicated by the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, included age ≥ 50 years, senior high school graduate, and worries about recurrence of SARS. Conclusion: Psychological distress was significantly correlated with demographic factors and perception regarding the SARS epidemic. It is suggested that marketing of mental health education should be segmented according to age and education level, which should enhance crisis communication for newly emerging infectious diseases among community populations. © 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

77956933877	Prevalence and correlates of lifetime suicidal ideation among HIV-infected male inmates in Taiwan	The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence and correlates of lifetime suicidal ideation (SI) among HIV-infected male inmates. All participants in seven prisons, comprising roughly 20% of all HIV-infected male inmates in Taiwan, were stratified by geographic location and surveyed using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire. The five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) was used on 535 participants to measure various dimensions of psychological distress. Seven questions regarding lifetime psychiatric symptoms were also added to the questionnaire. Questionnaire results in this sample revealed that 23.7% had suffered depressive symptoms for at least two weeks, 20.6% experienced serious anxiety or tension symptoms, 12.5% had serious thoughts of suicide symptoms, and 4.1% had made a suicide attempt. Results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that SI was significantly related to (1) recent psychological distress, and (2) lifetime experience of depression for two weeks or more, serious anxiety or tension, or hallucinations. Since nearly 70% of the respondents reported at least one psychiatric symptom in their lifetime, it would seem important to target HIV-infected male inmates with mental health interventions and suicide prevention. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

The study aimed to identify the characteristics associated with early suicide of those patients discharged from psychiatric wards in Taiwan. The results indicated that among 672 suicide victims who died within one year post-discharge from psychiatric wards in Taiwan between 2000 and 2004, diagnosis of schizophrenia, shorter disease duration, and co-morbidity with cancer were all significantly associated with suicide occurring within one month of discharge. Clinical diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, recent psychiatric diagnosis, and co-morbidity with severe physical illnesses should receive special monitoring for potential suicide after discharge. © 2010 The American Association of Suicidology.

79955891815	Why do people choose charcoal burning as a method of suicide? An interview based study of survivors in Taiwan	Background: Marked increases in the incidence of charcoal burning suicide have contributed to Taiwan's rising suicide rate in the past decade. To assess possible opportunities for intervention, we have compared survivors of suicide attempts by charcoal burning with people who ingested poisons. Methods: We interviewed a consecutive series of suicide attempters by charcoal burning (n = 37) and self-poisoning (n = 38) admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) between January 2009 and March 2010. Interviews included the Structured Clinical Interview of DSMIV (SCID) and Beck Suicide Intent Scale. Results: Compared to people who ingested medicines/poisons, charcoal burning suicide attempters were less likely to have a pre-existing physical illness or contact with psychiatric services prior to the attempt and more likely to be employed. Charcoal burning suicide attempters had higher levels of suicide intent (mean score 20.1) compared to people ingesting poisons (mean score 13.5) (p < 0.001) and were considerably more likely to report that their choice of method was influenced by the media (87% vs. 8%), particularly the portrayal of the method as a peaceful way of dying. Charcoal burning suicides were less impulsive. Limitations: The study sample was limited to a single hospital. Conclusions: Survivors of suicide attempts by charcoal burning have high levels of intent and low levels of psychiatric contact indicating they may be more difficult to prevent than suicides by self-poisoning. Encouraging responsible media reporting of suicide and restricting the availability of charcoal may be the most promising approaches to preventing these deaths. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

0036014481	Association of pyschological distress with psychological factors in rescue workers within two months after a major earthquake	Background and Purpose: Studies of the health of rescue workers after a major disaster have frequently focused on posttraumatic stress disorder. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of psychological distress and its psychosocial predictors in rescue workers within a 2-month period after an earthquake that struck central Taiwan on September 21, 1999. Methods: A total of 1,104 rescue workers serving in the earthquake were enrolled in the study. Psychological distress was measured using the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS), personality traits using the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), and family function using APGAR (adaptability, partnership, growth, affection, and resolve) indexes. These measurements were performed within 2 months of the earthquake. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to examine the association between psychological distress and various psychosocial factors. Results: BSRS assessment revealed severe psychological distress in 137 (16.4%) subjects. The most common symptom dimension was phobic-anxiety (18.7%), followed by hostility (17.6%), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (16.2%), depression (14.9%), paranoid ideation (14.2%), interpersonal sensitivity (13.3%), psychoticism (11.9%), anxiety (10.8%), additional symptoms (8.5%), and somatization (6.2%).

80054104228	Analysis of medical litigation among patients with medical disputes in cosmetic surgery in Taiwan	Background: This study aimed to investigate the key factors in medical disputes (arguments) among female patients after cosmetic surgery in Taiwan and to explore the correlates of medical litigation. Methods: A total of 6,888 patients (3,210 patients from two hospitals and 3,678 patients from two clinics) received cosmetic surgery from January 2001 to December 2009. The inclusion criteria specified female patients with a medical dispute. Chi-square testing and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Results: Of the 43 patients who had a medical dispute (hospitals, 0.53%; clinics, 0.73%), 9 plaintiffs eventually filed suit against their plastic surgeons. Such an outcome exhibited a decreasing annual trend. The hospitals and clinics did not differ significantly in terms of patient profiles. The Chi-square test showed that most patients with a medical dispute (p < 0.05) were older than 30 years, were divorced or married, had received operations under general anesthesia, had no economic stress, had a history of medical litigation, and eventually did not sue the surgeons. The test results also showed that the surgeon's seniority and experience significantly influenced the possibility of medical dispute and nonlitigation. Multiple logistical regression analysis further showed that the patients who did decide to enter into litigation had two main related factors: marital stress (odds ratio [OR], 10.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-94.73) and an education level below junior college (OR, 9.33; 95% CI, 1.01-86.36). Conclusion: The study findings suggest that the key characteristics of patients and surgeons should be taken into consideration not only in the search for ways to enhance pre- and postoperative communication but also as useful information for expert testimony in the inquisitorial law system. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.

80054717967	Evaluation of the suicide prevention program in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, using the CIPP evaluation model	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Kaohsiung Suicide Prevention Center (KSPC) of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, during the period from June 2005 to June 2008. We used a modified CIPP evaluation model to evaluate the suicide prevention program in Kaohsiung. Four evaluation models were applied to evaluate the KSPC: a context evaluation of the background and origin of the center, an input evaluation of the resources of the center, a process evaluation of the activities of the suicide prevention project, and a product evaluation of the ascertainment of project objectives. The context evaluation revealed that the task of the KSPC is to lower mortality. The input evaluation assessed the efficiency of manpower and the grants supported by Taiwan's Department of Health and Kaohsiung City government's Bureau of Health. In the process evaluation, we inspected the suicide prevention strategies of the KSPC, which are a modified version of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy of Australia. In the product evaluation, four major objectives were evaluated: (1) the suicide rate in Kaohsiung, (2) the reported suicidal cases, (3) crisis line calls, and (4) telephone counseling. From 2005 to 2008, the number of telephone counseling sessions (1,432, 2,010, 7,051, 12,517) and crisis line calls (0, 4,320, 10,339, 14,502) increased. Because of the increase in reported suicidal cases (1,328, 2,625, 2,795, and 2,989, respectively), cases which were underreported in the past, we have increasingly been able to contact the people who need help. During this same time period, the half-year suicide re-attempt rate decreased significantly for those who received services, and the committed suicide rate (21.4, 20.1, 18.2, and 17.8 per 100,000 populations, respectively) also decreased. The suicide prevention program in Kaohsiung is worth implementing on a continual basis if financial constraints are addressed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

83655166992	Finding social phobia patients from the Internet	Patients with social phobia commonly resist face-to-face assessments, and a number of alternative assessment methods based on the Internet are being developed. The aim of this study was to identify patients with social phobia on the Internet and characterize their condition, using the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). In Stage I, this study recruited 1307 participants from the Internet, most of whom were well-educated young females, who had remained unmarried and unemployed. The Internet-based SPIN demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.937) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.942). In Stage II, we examined the discriminant validity of the SPIN via structured telephone interviews. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve used to discriminate social phobia was 0.871 with an optimal cut-off point of 24 on the total score for the SPIN. According to the SPIN scores, 919 of Stage I participants (70.3%) reached the threshold of social phobia, 531 of which (57.8%) had never sought professional help. These results suggest that the Internet is a potential avenue through which to find untreated patients with social phobia. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The patient, with a history of dementia with Lewy bodies, had presented with multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms. Within 2 months of escitalopram, she became delirious with a serum sodium level of 122 mmol/L. After discontinuation of escitalopram, her consciousness improved with resolving hyponatremia. Delirium and hyponatremia (122 mmol/L), however, recurred after escitalopram was rechallenged. Apart from eight other cases to date, this is the only one with recurrent hyponatremia.

84860160455	Associations between chronotypes, psychopathology, and personality among incoming college students	Chronotye is associated with age, sex, personality, and parental monitoring during childhood. The evening type is associated with poor school performance, sleep problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, tobacco smoking, caffeine consumption, alcohol drinking, and suicidality in adolescents. The present study tested the relationships between chronotype and a wide range of psychopathology and personality traits among 2919 incoming undergraduate students. Each participant completed a self-administered questionnaire that included demographics, plus the Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) scale, Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS), Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and Maudesley Personality Inventory. The t-score distribution of the M-E scale was used to form the morning (t-score >60, n=419), evening (t-score <40, n=371), and intermediate (40≤t-score≤60, n=2129) groups. Multivariable regression was employed for data analysis. For males, the evening type scored higher on all subscales of the BSRS than the morning type, except phobic anxiety. For females, the evening type had higher scores than the other two types on all subscales, except in obsession/compulsion and phobic anxiety, where the evening type only scored higher than the intermediate type. The evening type of both sexes also scored higher than the morning type in novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and neurotic personality characteristics, but lower than the morning type in extraversion and social desirability. In reward dependence, the evening type scored lowest for males, but there was no difference for females. The findings of the evening type being associated with possible psychopathology and certain types of personality have public health implications, that is, chronotype needs to be taken into account in the development of mental health prevention programs and assessment of and intervention for mental problems in young adults.

84860730803	Low prevalence of major depressive disorder in Taiwanese adults: Possible explanations and implications	Background This study examined the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), and the correlations and co-morbid conditions associated with MDD, in the adult Taiwanese population, which a previous estimate in the 1980s had found to be at the lower end of the spectrum worldwide. Possible explanations for the reported low prevalence of MDD were evaluated.Method As part of a survey of common psychiatric disorders in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged ≥18 years who were non-institutionalized civilians in Taiwan, a face-to-face interview using the paper version of the World Mental Health Survey of the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI) was conducted between 2003 and 2005. Functional impairment and help-seeking behaviors were compared between Taiwanese subjects with MDD and their counterparts in the USA.Results Among the 10 135 respondents, the lifetime prevalence of MDD was 1.20% [standard error (s.e.)=0.2%]. Individuals who were divorced or widowed, aged ≤40 years, and female were at increased risk, whereas rural residents were at lower risk for MDD. The proportion of MDD cases co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders in this study was much lower than in the US study. Only one-third of Taiwanese individuals with MDD sought help despite having twice the number of lost workdays compared with the US sample.Conclusions Despite the low prevalence of MDD in Taiwanese adults, the pattern of low help-seeking behavior and profound functional impairment indicates much room for improvement in the early detection of and intervention in major depression in this population. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

0038670487	Development of a teaching style inventory for tutor evaluation in problem-based learning	Objective: To develop and validate a self-rating instrument to assess teaching styles among tutors in problem-based learning (PBL). Methods: The development of the teaching style inventory (TSI) was based theoretically on four types of teaching behaviours: the assertive, suggestive, collaborative and facilitative styles, as proposed by Bibace et al. A 35-item questionnaire was generated and evaluated for content validity by a group of experienced tutors. The questionnaire was mailed to 196 tutors at the National Taiwan University College of Medicine. The results were submitted for item analysis, internal consistency testing and exploratory factor analysis. Longterm test-retest reliability was assessed by a sample of 50 tutors after a 6-month interval. Results: Finally, 118 tutors returned the questionnaires. In the item reduction process, seven items were excluded due to low interscale correlation. Principle component factoring yielded a three-factor solution that accounted for 48.5% of the total variance. Internal consistency coefficients of the four hypothetical domains ranged from 0.73 to 0.83. All domains correlated to each other as expected. Assertive and facilitative styles, which are theoretically opposite teaching styles, showed a negative correlation with each other. Most of the items of each hypothetical domain correlated better with their own domain than with other domains. Longterm test-retest correlations of the four domains ranged from 0.54 to 0.81. Conclusion: The TSI demonstrated high internal consistency reliability, acceptable longterm test-retest reliability, and construct validity. Further psychometric testing should focus on applicability to other populations, predictive validity and short-term test-retest reliability. This instrument can be used by programme directors for the recruitment of tutors and can also be used to increase the self-awareness of tutors.

84868633531	Predictors for suicidal ideation after occupational injury	Risk of suicide has been associated with trauma and negative life events in several studies. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation, and the population attributable risk among workers after occupational injuries. We investigated workers who had been hospitalized for ≥ 3. days after occupational injuries between February 1 and August 31, 2009. A self-reported questionnaire including demographic data, injury condition, and the question of suicidal ideation was sent to 4498 workers at 3. months after their occupational injury. A total of 2001 workers (45.5%) completed the questionnaires and were included in final analysis. The prevalence of reporting suicidal ideation was 8.3%. After mutual adjustment, significant risk factors for suicidal ideation higher than "serious" in a self-rated severity scale (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.31; adjusted population attributable risk, aPAR = 34.7%), total hospital stay for 8. days or longer (OR = 1.98; aPAR = 20.5%), intracranial injury (OR = 2.30; aPAR = 10.2%), and marriage status of being divorced/separated/widowed (OR = 2.70; aPAR = 10.0%). Three months after occupational injury, a significant proportion of workers suffered from suicidal ideation. Significant predictors of suicidal ideation after occupational injury included broken marriage, intracranial injury, injury severity, and total hospital stay. Identification of high risk subjects for early intervention is warranted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84873739441	Gender and age differences among youth, in utilization of mental health services in the year preceding suicide in Taiwan	The primary objective of this study was to explore gender and age differences in the use of medical services during the year preceding suicide. Data were obtained from the mortality dataset of Department of Health and National Health Insurance Database. Included in the sample were 862 persons aged 12-24 years who committed suicide in Taiwan between 2001 and 2004. We compared the records of medical service utilization of adolescents (ages 12-18 years) with young adults (ages 19-24 years). Persons in both age groups contacted general practitioners more often than other types of medical providers in the year preceding suicide, with the exception of the month before suicide. Females made greater use of medical services than males in both age groups. Suicide prevention strategies should increase the emphasis in training non-psychiatric medical practitioners to identify and treat young persons at suicide risk. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84873741791	Community-based case management for the prevention of suicide reattempts in Kaohsiung, Taiwan	Although a previous suicide attempt constitutes a major risk factor for an eventual completed suicide, few interventions specifically designed to prevent suicide reattempts have been evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of case management for the prevention of suicide reattempts. A total of 4,765 subjects with a recent suicide attempt referred from medical and non-medical organizations were consecutively recruited from July 2006 to June 2008. The suicide prevention program of Kaohsiung Suicide Prevention Center (KSPC) provided case management and followed up suicideattempt cases for 6 months. Survival analysis showed that the risk of suicide reattempt was significantly lower in the case management group than in the non-contact group throughout a six-month follow-up period (hazard ratio = 2.93; 95% CI = 2.47-3.47). The hazard ratio (HR) of the Cox proportional hazard model for sex was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.65-0.91). Case management appears to be effective in preventing suicide reattempts in patients with a recent prior attempt. In addition, case management appeared to be more beneficial in preventing suicide reattempts in male subjects. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84879202005	Effectiveness of a nationwide aftercare program for suicide attempters	Background The effectiveness of large-scale interventions to prevent suicide among persons who previously attempted suicide remains to be determined. The National Suicide Surveillance System (NSSS), launched in Taiwan in 2006, is a structured nationwide intervention program for people who survived their suicide attempts. This naturalistic study examined its effectiveness using data from the first 3 years of its operation. Method Effectiveness of the NSSS aftercare services was examined using a logistic/proportional odds mixture model, with eventual suicide as the outcome of interest. As well, we examined time until death for those who died and factors associated with eventual suicide. Results Receipt of aftercare services was associated with reduced risk for subsequent suicide; for service recipients who eventually killed themselves, there was a prolonged duration between the index and fatal attempts. Elderly attempters were particularly prone to a shorter duration between the index and fatal attempts. Male gender, the lethality potential of the index attempt, and a history of having had a mental disorder also were associated with higher risk. Conclusions The structured aftercare program of the NSSS appears to decrease suicides and to delay time to death for those who remained susceptible to suicide. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

84885481152	Identifying high-school dance students who will develop an eating disorder: A 1-year prospective study	This study examined the changes in eating disorder (ED) status over 1 year and identified risk factors for EDs among female dance students. In 2003, all students enrolled in each of the nation's 12 high schools with gifted dance programs participated in a two-phase survey. The same participants were invited to take part in a follow-up survey 1 year later. In all, 583 persons completed the phase 1 questionnaire survey, and 245 persons completed interviews twice at baseline and follow-up. Thirty-five females had a newly developed ED, and less than half of the ED cases found at baseline had recovered at follow-up. Being a grade 12 student carried a reduced risk of EDs, whereas higher baseline scores on the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE) increased risks of developing an ED after 1 year. A 10-item BITE questionnaire validly identified girl dance students who would develop EDs later in high school. EDs were more commonly developed during middle adolescence, and we suggest that prevention work against EDs begin in this period among the dance student population. The brief screening questionnaire might help detect intervention targets of a prevention program among adolescent dance students. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84885676672	The predictors of suicidality in previous suicide attempters following case management services	Suicide attempts constitute a serious clinical problem. People who have attempted suicide are at an elevated risk for additional suicide attempts, but there is limited evidence regarding the predictors of suicidality of suicide attempters following case management services. In the present study the indicators of suicidality after case management were examined. A total of 1,056 subjects who had recently attempted suicide were recruited from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2011. The suicide prevention center of Kaohsiung City in Taiwan provided case management services and followed up on suicide attempt cases for 6 months. The salient factors for repeat suicide attempts were estimated using a logistic regression analysis. The results showed that multiple factors, including a "willingness to receive mental health services during a crisis," "social support," "a history of mental disorders," and "a history of suicide," could predict repeat suicide attempts with hazard ratios (0.58, 0.54, 3.84, 1.51) and 95% confidence interval (0.39-0.86, 0.36-0.83, 2.41-6.10, 1.03-2.21). The four factors mentioned above were the most accurate predictors of subsequent suicidality when case management services were utilized after 6 months of follow-up. The findings of our study could help clarify future strategies for suicide prevention. © 2013 The American Association of Suicidology.

84885315813	Perception of spokespersons' performance and characteristics in crisis communication: Experience of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in taiwan	Background/Purpose: To explore perception of spokespersons' performance and characteristics in response to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Methods: This study was conducted from March to July, 2005, using semi-structured in-depth interviews to collect data. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze the transcribed data. Interviewees included media reporters, media supervisors, health and medical institution executives or spokespersons, and social observers. Results: Altogether, 35 interviewees were recruited for in-depth interviews, and the duration of the interview ranged from 1 hour to 2 hours. Results revealed that the most important characteristics of health/medical institutions spokespersons are professional competence and good interaction with the media. In contrast, the most important behaviors they should avoid are concealing the truth and misreporting the truth. Three major flaws of spokespersons' performance were identified: they included poor understanding of media needs and landscape; blaming the media to cover up a mistake they made in an announcement; and lack of sufficient participation in decision-making or of authorization from the head of organization. Conclusion: Spokespersons of health and medical institutions play an important role in media relations during the crisis of a newly emerging infectious disease. © 2013.

84885321794	Work-related fatigue among medical personnel in Taiwan	Background/Purpose: Work-related fatigue among medical personnel is a major concern for patient safety, however heavy on-call duty is common in many hospitals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of self-reported work-related fatigue and its associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1833 participants was conducted in two hospitals in Taipei City, Taiwan, using a self-administered questionnaire. Participants reported their demographic characteristics, health-related behavior, health status and symptoms, and work-related fatigue during the past 3 months. Results: The prevalence of work-related fatigue among the 1833 participants was 30.9%. Youngerparticipants (20-29 years old) were more likely to report work-related fatigue than older participants (40-65 years old) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-2.01]. Physicians, nurses, and medical technicians were more likely to report work-related fatigue symptoms than administrative personnel (aOR=2.30, 95% CI=1.57-2.79; aOR=2.83, 95% CI=1.87-3.99; and aOR=2.01, 95% CI=1.12-3.06, respectively). Those who drank coffee more than five times a week were more likely to report work-related fatigue than those who did not drink coffee at all (aOR=2.53, 95% CI=1.25-1.93). Participants with poor and very poor self-reported health were more likely to report work-related fatigue (aOR=1.80, 95% CI=1.26-2.38) than those who reported that their health was fair, good, or very good. Conclusion: We identified factors associated with work-related fatigue among hospital workers in Taipei City. These findings can be applied toward on-the-job training and the development of preventive measures for occupational safety in general hospitals. © 2013.

84890546646	Comparative validity of the chinese versions of the bulimic inventory test edinburgh and eating attitudes test for DSM-IV eating disorders among high school dance and nondance students in taiwan	Objectives To compare the validity of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE) as screening tools for eating disorders (EDs), and to identify a new threshold for each questionnaire to detect ED cases among dance and nondance students. Method Dance students enrolled in high schools with gifted dance programs and nondance students randomly chosen from the same or nearby schools were invited to participate in a 2-phase ED survey. Participants completed the EAT and BITE questionnaires in the first phase. All participants who screened positive and 10% of the participants who screened negative were interviewed blindly using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders Patient Edition. Results The BITE had better accuracy than the EAT in detecting ED in general among both dance and non-dance students. BITE scores of 19 and 16 were the optimal cutoff values for determining ED among dance and nondance students, respectively. The optimal cutoff value for the EAT to diagnose an ED was 19 for dance students and 12 for nondance students. Both questionnaires showed higher sensitivity and lower specificity in dance students than nondance students at the same cutoff points. Discussion The BITE had better diagnostic performance than the EAT in this nonclinical population, although its ability to detect restrictive behaviors is likely as limited as that of the EAT. Plausible explanations for these results and limitations of this study are discussed in the text. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84893001746	Co-Occurring Eating and Psychiatric Symptoms in Taiwanese College Students: Effects of Gender and Parental Factors	Objective: To test whether gender and parental factors moderate the relationships between symptoms of eating disorder (ED) and other psychiatric symptoms. Methods: A total of 5,015 new entrants completed several questionnaires and 541individuals with ED symptoms were identified by the Adult Self-Report Inventory-4 that assessed a wide range of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition psychopathology. The participants also reported on their parents' attitude toward them before their ages of 16. Results: ED symptoms, female gender, less parental care, and more parental protection were associated with more severe co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. Gender and parental factors also demonstrated differential moderating effects on the relationships between ED and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Parenting counseling may be individualized to young adults with ED symptoms and different co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0742270590	Hyperleptinemia in Subjects with Persistent Partial Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after a Major Earthquake	Objective: Leptin, a peptide hormone derived from adipose tissue, regulates food intake and controls weight. Serum leptin levels may be elevated in critically ill patients and in cases of physical stress. Our aim was to examine the relationship between postdisaster psychiatric symptoms and serum leptin levels. Methods: We recruited 92 subjects who visited emergency medical stations immediately after the giant earthquake seized middle Taiwan on September 21, 1999. Of these cases, 43 met the criteria for subsyndromal acute stress disorder. Eighteen months later, we measured serum leptin levels and performed in-depth psychiatric assessments using the posttraumatic stress disorder subset in the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Instrument and the Brief Symptom Rating Scale short form. Results: After we adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index, serum leptin levels were significantly higher in the persistent subsyndromal group (N = 15; estimated marginal mean, 9.641; 95% confidence interval, 7.673-11.610) than in others (estimated marginal means, 4.775-6.368). A hyperaroused state predicted a higher adjusted leptin level. On the Brief Symptom Rating Scale, general severity index, paranoid tendency, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were positively correlated with adjusted leptin levels. Conclusions: We found a direct relationship between stress-related psychopathologic symptoms and serum leptin levels. Subjects with persistent subsyndromal posttraumatic stress disorder and hyperarousal had significantly higher serum leptin levels. Therefore, leptin may be a valid neuroendocrinologic marker for the hypervigilant state of vulnerable people who have faced tremendous danger and uncertainty. Further studies are needed to examine the correlation between leptin levels and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, particularly the inverted diurnal serum leptin levels in hyperaroused subjects.

1342288365	Development and verification of validity and reliability of a short screening instrument to identify psychiatric morbidity	Background and Purpose: The accurate identification of minor mental disorders associated with depression and anxiety in non-psychiatric medical settings is an important component of mental health care. The present study aimed to develop a reliable and valid short screening tool to improve the identification of psychiatric morbidity. Methods: Data from the 50-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-50) obtained from 721 medical inpatients were used to develop a short screening tool (BSRS-5) ot identify psychiatric morbidity. The BSRS-5 comprises 5 symptom items, selected from the BSRS-50, each of which has the highest correlation with the corresponding subscale score of Anxiety, Depression, Hostility, Interpersonal Sensitivity and Additional Symptoms in the BSRS-50. Various types of reliability and validity of the BSRS-5 were assessed in different populations, including 253 human immunodeficiency virus-1 infected outpatients, 257 psychiatric outpatients, 56 psychiatric inpatients, 100 rehabilitation outpatients with chronic low back pain, 2915 university freshmen, and 1090 community members. Results: Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) coefficients of the BSRS-5 ranged from 0.77 to 0.90. The test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.82. Concurrent validity coefficients between the sum score of BSRS-5 and the General Severity Index of BSRS-50 ranged from 0.87 to 0.95. Choosing 6+ as the cut-off score for psychiatric cases, the rate of accurate classification of BSRS-5 was 76.3% (78.9% sensitivity, 74.3 % specificity, 69.9% positive predictive value, 82.3% negative predictive value). The BSRS-5 could differentiate the severity of illness in psychiatric outpatients based on psychiatrist's ratings using the Clinical Global Impression scale, severity of psychopathology of psychiatric inpatients between admission and discharge, levels of pain indicated by 4 dimensions of the Dallas Pain Questionnaire for outpatients with chronic low back pain, and the severity of psychopathology between university students and community members with and without suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The BSRS-5 can be used to identify psychiatric morbidity in both medical practice and the community.
