9444286947	Spiral CT localization of pancreatic functioning islet cell tumors	Background: Surgeons are always concerned about the localization of pancreatic functioning islet cell tumor. If the tumor is accurately localized before operation, resection of the pancreatic body and tail without intention can be avoided. The purpose of this study was to evaluate spiral CT localization of pancreatic functioning islet cell tumors and CT techniques. Methods: CT manifestations in 6 patients with clinically and pathologically proved pancreatic functioning islet cell tumors were analyzed retrospectively. Results: In 4 patients with insulinomas and 2 patients with glucagonomas, 5 were localized accurately by CT before surgery and 1 was detected retrospectively. The enhancement of tumors was greater than that of normal pancreas in arterial phase and pancreatic parenchymal phase. Four patients showed mild high-density and 2, iso-density in the portal venous phase. Conclusion: Spiral CT multi-phase enhanced scan with 1.5 ml/kg contrast agent and 2-5 mm slice width can localize functioning islet cell tumors accurately. © 2004, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

16244367165	Study on detoxification of main alkaloids in Aconitum by high performance liquid chromatography- atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry	High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/ Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) has been applied for analysis of alkaloid mixtures from the aconite of Aconitum and Si-Ni decoction. The detoxification of the alkaloids was also investigated, and 14-benzoylaconine, 14-benzoylmesaconine and 14-benzoylhypaconine were found as hydrolysis products. Diesterditerpene-type Aconitum alkaloids are converted into benzoylaconine derivatives by hydrolysis, and then into aconine derivatives. Thus, the toxicity of alkaloids was reduced. The compatibleness could synergistically affect the reduction of toxicity during hydrolysis. © by PSP 2005.

14844286406	Tamoxifen can reverse multidrug resistance of colorectal carcinoma in vivo	Aim: To investigate the effect of tamoxifen (TAM) on multidrug resistance (MDR) of colorectal carcinoma in vivo and its relationship with estrogen receptor (ER). Methods: Multidrug resistance was determined by means of semi-quantitative retro-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to test mdr1 gene mRNA and ER expression was studied by immunohistochemistry. Tumor tissues from three cases of human colon carcinoma, which had mdr1(+)/ER(+), mdr1(+)/ER(-), mdr1(-) expressions, were planted subcutaneously in the neck of nude mice to establish three xenograft models. These models were subdivided into four subgroups randomly: Doxorubicin (DOX)-treated group, TAM-treated group, DOX and TAM group and control group. The dimensions of these xenografts were measured after each course of treatment and the xenografts were removed at the end of the experiments for measurements of weight and the variation of mdr1 mRNA level with RT-PCR. In each course, TAM [15 mg/(kg/d)] was administrated orally per day in the first seven days and DOX (3.6 mg/kg) was injected peritoneally on the first day. Data was evaluated by q and t tests. Results: In the animal models with mdr1(-) tumor, the weights and volumes of the planted tumor in DOX group [(39.1±2.29) mg, (31.44±1.61) mm

22244435245	Chinese herbal formula, Bing De Ling, enhances antitumor effects and ameliorates weight loss induced by 5-fluorouracil in the mouse CT26 tumor model	The use of complementary and alternative medicines-including a variety of herbal therapies-by patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy has been well documented. Despite such widespread use, however, the benefits and potential mechanisms of such herbal medicines remain largely anecdotal. In this study we examined the effects of a Chinese herbal formula, Bing De Ling, when administered as an adjunct to chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the CT26 mouse colon cancer model. 5-FU and Bing De Ling were administered to both naïve and CT26 mouse colon cancer-bearing BALB/c mice. Our results indicate that although the herbal formula alone did not result in antitumor effects under experimental conditions, it significantly enhanced 5-FU-induced tumor growth inhibition. Oral administration of Bing De Ling also increased survival rates of both tumor-bearing and tumor-free mice treated with 5-FU. Furthermore, oral administration of Bing De Ling reduced weight loss in tumor-free mice receiving 5-FU when compared to tumor-free mice that received 5-FU alone. Our data further show that 5-FU upregulates serum levels of IL-6, known to contribute to weight loss, in tumor-free mice, and that this increase in IL-6 is significantly less in mice that received Bing De Ling in addition to 5-FU. These data show Bing De Ling both enhances the antitumor responses of 5-FU and ameliorates side effects. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

28444492992	Physicochemical characterization of the Strychnos alkaloids by capillary zone electrophoresis	A capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method has been developed for investigating the physicochemical characteristics of five Strychnos alkaloids in Strychnos nux-vomica L. Firstly, the dissociation constants of the five Strychnos alkaloids were determined, based on the relation between the effective mobility of the solutes and the buffer pH. The mathematical relationship was strictly deduced from the fundamental electrophoretic theory and the dissociation equilibrium. Secondly, an equation describing the relation between the migration time of alkaloids of similar structure and their molecular weights was developed and used to predict the migration order and to calculate the electrosomotic velocity. The results predicted by the theory agreed with those from experiments. 2005 © The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

27744590599	High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for identification of isoflavones and description of the biotransformation of kudzu root	High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry has been used to identify isoflavone aglycones and glycosides in kudzu root. Fourteen isoflavones were detected. Among these, six were identified by comparison with authentic standards. Tentative identifications of the other isoflavones are based on UV spectra, mass spectra of protonated and deprotonated molecules, and MS-MS data. Several are reported for the first time in kudzu root. The bioactivity and bioavailability of isoflavone aglycones are usually greater than those of their glycosides. To improve the bioavailability of kudzu root isoflavones, crude β-glycosidases prepared from microbes were used to hydrolyze the isoflavone glycosides. Several MS modes are combined not only to identify the isoflavones in kudzu root, but also to describe the biotransformation of kudzu root isoflavone glycosides. It is also proved that crude β-glycosidases have high selectivity toward the O-glycosides of isoflavones. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

31444447562	Effect of total flavone of Litchi Chinensis Sonn on duck hepatitis B virus	AIM: To study the anti-duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) action of the total flavone of Litchi Chinensis Sonn (TFL). METHODS: Guilin ducklings with congenital infection of DHBV were used as the animal modal. TFL was orally given to the ducks with the doses 2 g/(kg·d) and 1 g/(kg·d) for 15 days. The expression of DHBV DNA was detected by spot blot hybridization before and after TFL was given. The pathological changes of the duck liver were also examined by HE staining. RESULTS: TFL at the dose of 2 g/(kg·d) can lower the level of serum DHBV DNA significantly (vs control group: 0.74±0.42 vs 1.64±0.68, P <0.05) 15 days after treatment. No marked necrosis was observed in the liver of high dose group (0/6), but 4 of 6 cases appeared obvious necrosis in control group after treatment. There was significant difference between them (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: TFL can protect duck liver against inflammation by the inhibition of DHBV.

33747879616	Optimization of Analysis Method of Kudzu Root Crude Extract by High Performance Liquid Chromatography	Kudzu root is an important traditional Chinese herb. Its crude extract has been used in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris in China. Several parameters for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical method for kudzu root extract, including HPLC model, mobile phase, additive and gradient conditions, have been optimized. The HPLC retention parameters a and c, and the peak shape parameters σ and τ of 25 chromatographic peaks were obtained accurately and rapidly using five linear gradients and were calculated using CSASS software. The CSASS software was then used to simulate the gradient conditions in the experiments, and the optimized condition was obtained. The comparison of the simulated and real chromatogram profiles showed that the potential of simulation using the CSASS software as compared with that of the real experimental conditions was precise. The reversed-phase HPLC model and the mobile phase of (A) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and (B) water containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid were used. The optimized gradient profile showed a linear increase as follows: from 5% A to 35% A at 0-33 min; from 35% A to 100% A at 33-50 min; then the HPLC system was held for 5 min. The reproducibility and precision of the method were investigated. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of retention time, peak height, and peak area were less than 0.25%, 11%, and 4.9%, respectively, which showed that the method was stable, reliable, and reproducible. © 2006 Chinese Chemical Society and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

34548093564	Multi-slice spiral CT angiography in evaluating donors of living-related liver transplantation	Background: During the past years, the number of liver transplantation has increased greatly, but the number of available organs has not increased. In view of the critical shortage of organs, the indications for living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) have broadened since experience with the procedure has been achieved. This study was undertaken to assess the value of multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) angiography in evaluating the hepatic arterial and veinous anatomy of potential donors for LRLT. Methods: MSCT was performed after intravenous injection of contrast material at 3 ml/s. The total dose was calculated as 2 ml/kg. Twenty LRLT donors (2 men and 18 women) were subjected to MSCT angiography of hepatic blood vessels. These were generated by volume rendering and maximum intensity projection, while curved planar reformation was added in 5 patients. Results: We identified 10 important hepatic vascular variants in 9 of the 20 donors (4 arterial, 4 venous, and 2 portal venous variants). In hepatic arterial variants, two had a replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery, an accessory right hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery and a replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery. In hepatic venous variants, three had an accessory inferior right hepatic vein and one had two accessory inferior right hepatic veins. In hepatic portal venous variants, two had trifurcation of the main portal vein. Conclusions: As a non-invasive and reliable method, MSCT angiography is of value in the clinical evaluation of LRLT donors. MSCT angiography should be recommended as a routine preoperative examination for potential LRLT donors. © 2007, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

METHODS: Forty-three elderly patients with advanced digestive tract cancers were randomly enrolled in the study and divided into two groups. The degree of depression was evaluated by the Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS). IAP was examined by simple agar diffusion. Immunological parameters such as the percentage of T-lymphocyte subsets and natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood were determined and compared between the two groups of patients by flow cytometry. Patients who were depressed according to the scores of the SDS took antidepressant therapy. After patients were assessed as normal, the immunological parameters were RESULTS: The depression rate was 44%. SDS was positively correlated with the level of IAP (r = 0.549, P < 0.01), negatively correlated with the percentages of CD3 and CD4 (r = -0.163, P < 0.001 and r = -0.163, P < 0.001), and had no relationship with the percentages of NK or CD8 (r = 0.262, P > 0.05 and r = 0.611, P > 0.05). The two groups showed significant differences of IAP, CD3 and CD4 (IAP: 908.33 ± 275.75 mg/L vs 537.60 ± 282.64 mg/L, P < 0.01; CD3: 67.05 ± 13.12 vs 73.27 ± 8.03, P < 0.05; and CD4: 36.68 ± 11.29 vs 43.72 ± 9.16, P < 0.05) between the depressed and non-depressed groups. The change of IAP before and after antidepressant therapy was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, and NK between the two groups showed no obvious changes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is a high rate of depression in elderly patients with cancers of the digestive tract. Antidepressant treatment was found to improve immune function.

37749032393	Systematic screening and characterization of flavonoid glycosides in Carthamus tinctorius L. by liquid chromatography/UV diode-array detection/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry	The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a complex system, which always consists of numerous compounds with significant difference in the content and physical and chemical properties. In this paper, a screening method based on target molecular weights was developed to characterize the flavonoid glycosides in the flower of Carthamus tinctorius L. The screening tables of aglycone and glycan were designed, respectively, in order to select and combine freely. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan mode with higher sensitivity and selectivity was adopted in the screening, which benefit the characterization for the minor components. Seventy-seven flavonoid glycosides were screened out finally, and their structures were characterized by tandem mass spectrometric method in both positive and negative ion modes. The glycosylation mode, aglycone, sequence and/or the interglycosidic linkages of the glycan portion and glycosylation position were elucidated by the fragmentation rule in the MS. Numerous compounds screened out with this method showed the structure variety in secondary plant metabolites, and the purposeful screening systemically and subsequent structure characterization offered more information about the chemical constitutions of TCM. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

0033807087	A SXRF method for determining the relative concentration of trace elements in plasma protein affected by cisplatin	This article presents an analytical method for the determination of the relative concentrations of trace elements in plasma protein by gel chromatography combined with SXRF (synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence). The fraction of plasma protein of male Kunming mice (body weight 24.2 ± 0.3 g), treated with a cisplatin ip injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg, was obtained by the separation of a Sephadex G-50 column (buffered with ammonium acetate, pH 5.7). The SXRF experiments were performed at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider synchrotron radiation facility. The elements (Pt, S, Ca, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Br, and Sr) in the fraction of the plasma proteins (>22 kDa) were assayed using highly sensitive SXRF. The relative concentrations of elements were calculated by a normalization of Compton scattering intensity around 22 keV, after the normalization for the collection time of the X-ray spectrum and the counting of the ion chamber, and subtracting the contribution of the polycarbonate film for the supporting sample. The determination could prove that the element Pt in plasma was bound with macromolecular protein. Cu and S were present in the fraction of the protein in mice treated with cisplatin increase, and their ratios of treated/control were 1.66 ± 0.06 and 1.78 ± 0.33, respectively; Zn decreased to a ratio of 0.78 ± 0.09. Our results are in agreement with others that cisplatin exposure leads to a marked loss of kidney copper and a moderate rise in kidney zinc. However, this article primarily describes one of the analytical methods used; it does not emphasize the results of the effect of cisplatin on trace elements in plasma protein.

38549113419	Potential protein toxicity of synthetic pigments: Binding of poncean S to human serum albumin	Using various methods, e.g., spectrophotometry, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry, the interaction of poncean S (PS) with human serum albumin (HSA) was characterized at pH 1.81, 3.56, and 7.40 using the spectral correction technique, and Langmuir and Temkin isothermal models. The consistency among results concerning, e.g., binding number, binding energy, and type of binding, showed that ion pair electrostatic attraction fixed the position of PS in HSA and subsequently induced a combination of multiple noncovalent bonds such as H-bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. Ion pair attraction and H-bonds produced a stable PS-HSA complex and led to a marked change in the secondary structure of HSA in acidic media. The PS-HSA binding pattern and the process of change in HSA conformation were also investigated. The potentially toxic effect of PS on the transport function of HSA in a normal physiological environment was analyzed. This work provides a useful experimental strategy for studying the interaction of organic substances with biomacromolecules, helping us to understand the activity or mechanism of toxicity of an organic compound. © 2008 by the Biophysical Society.

84861796127	High level interleukin-6 in the medium of human pancreatic cancer cell culture suppresses production of neurotransmitters by PC12 cell line	It has been suggested that pancreatic cancer is associated with a greater prevalence of depression than many other cancers, but the mechanism accounting for this potential association has not yet been illustrated. In the present study, conditioned media (CM) from three pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary pancreatic cancer cells from two patients were added to culture system of differentiated pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. The release of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) by PC12 was significantly inhibited after CM treatment (P<0.05), similar to what happened after recombinant interleukin 6(IL-6) treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment with anti-IL-6 antibody significantly blocked the inhibitory effects of pancreatic cancer CM on DA and NE production (P<0.05). We also demonstrated that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of catecholamine, was reduced after exposure to IL-6, which was accompanied by JAK-STAT3 pathway activation. Our results demonstrated that IL-6 in CM from pancreatic cancer down-regulated the production of DA and NE by PC12 cell. The possible underlying mechanisms might be decreasing TH production via activation of JAK-STAT3 signal transduction pathway. The present study might help to better understand the close relationship between pancreatic cancer and depression. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84861861100	MiR-145 inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth by N-RAS and VEGF	MiR-145 is known as a tumor suppressor in numerous human cancers. However, its role in tumor angiogenesis remains poorly defined. In this study, we found that miR-145 was significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues by using 106 cases of normal and cancer tissues as well as in breast cancer cells. MiR-145 exhibited inhibitory role in tumor angiogenesis, cell growth and invasion and tumor growth through the post-transcriptional regulation of the novel targets N-RAS and VEGF-A. In addition, we provide evidence that the expression levels of miR-145 correlate inversely with malignancy stages of breast tumors, although there is no association between miR-145 levels and hormone receptor levels in breast cancer. Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR-145 plays important inhibitory role in breast cancer malignancy by targeting N-RAS and VEGF-A, which may be potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84877117382	MicroRNA-143 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis and sensitizes chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin in colorectal cancers	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancer-related causes of death in the world. Recently, downregulation of microRNA-143 (miR-143) has been observed in CRC tissues. Here in this study, we found that miR-143 expression was downregulated both in CRC patients' blood samples and tumor specimens. MiR-143 expression levels were strongly correlated with clinical stages and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), a known oncogene, was a novel direct target of miR-143, whose expression levels were inversely correlated with miR-143 expression in human CRC specimens. Overexpression of miR-143 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, tumor growth and angiogenesis and increased chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin treatment in an IGF-IR-dependent manner. Taken together, these results revealed that miR-143 levels in human blood and tumor tissues are associated with CRC cancer occurrence, metastasis and drug resistance, and miR-143 levels may be used as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC in the future. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

41749116894	Accuracy of 16-row multislice computed tomographic angiography for assessment of small cerebral aneurysms	OBJECTIVE: Many cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage are the result of rupture of small cerebral aneurysms. The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 16-row multislice computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in detecting small cerebral aneurysms (≤5 mm) compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), surgical findings, or both. METHODS: One hundred ninety-two consecutive patients underwent CTA for suspected cerebral aneurysms. All aneurysms prospectively detected by CTA were confirmed by DSA or surgery. This was performed with a 16-detector row machine, with a detector slice of 0.75 mm, reconstruction interval of 0.40 mm, and timing determined by bolus trigger. CTA and DSA images were reviewed by two independent, blinded neuroradiologists who performed aneurysm detection, quantitation, and characterization using maximum-intensity projections, shaded-surface display, and volume-rendering techniques reconstructions. RESULTS: Combining CTA, DSA, and intraoperative findings, 64 small cerebral aneurysms (≤5 mm) were identified in 54 (28%) of the 192 patients. Three small cerebral aneurysms identified on CTA were not clearly depicted at DSA but were confirmed at surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 16-slice CTA for small aneurysms were all 100% on a per aneurysm basis. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 16-slice CTA for small aneurysms were both 100%, respectively, on a per aneurysm basis. There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity between 16-slice CTA and DSA (P > 0.05). Sixteen-slice CTA images show more clarity and accuracy in the relationship of aneurysms to bone structures and adjacent branch vessels. CONCLUSION: Noninvasive 16-slice CTA is sensitive enough to replace conventional DSA in the triage, diagnosis, and treatment planning in patients with small cerebral aneurysms.

43249105556	Two-dimensional LC-MS analysis of components in Swertia franchetiana Smith	An off-line 2-D-LC approach was developed for the separation and identification of components in extracts of Swertia franchetiana Smith, which is a traditional Chinese medicine. An octadecylsilica column was used for further separation of fractions from a cyanc, column with UV and MS detection. In this method, a longer column was used in the second dimension to improve the separation ability, and "on-column focusing" was adopted to reduce sample loss and pollution on concentrating the fractions from the first dimension. More than 118 and 575 components were detected in the chloroform and n-butanol extracts by this method, respectively. In contrast, only 20 and 95 peaks were detected by the one-dimensional method. Most of the additionally detected compounds were of low-abundance components. Many compounds can be preliminarily identified according to their UV and mass spectra in the two-dimensional method. The obtained results not only demonstrated the powerful resolution of 2-D-LC, but also led to in-depth comprehension of the UV and mass spectra of complex samples. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

42549170070	Indomethacin enhances the cytotoxicity of recombinant human lymphotoxin α on tumor cells by suppressing NFκB signaling	Indomethacin is widely used to treat inflammatory and prevent adverse events which frequently accrue in biotherapy. In phase I clinical trial of recombinant human lymphotoxin α (rhLTα), indomethacin was premedicated to alleviate chill and fever. However, it is unknown whether indomethacin influences the therapeutic efficacy of rhLTα. In this study we found that pre-treatment with low dose of indomethacin enhanced the cytotoxicity of rhLTα and/or cisplatin/adriamycin on human tumor cells. Further investigation demonstrated that indomethacin dose-dependently suppressed the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) by inhibiting phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. In addition, indomethacin decreased the expression of NFκB-regulated gene products involved in rhLTα-induced anti-apoptosis (XIAP, cFLIP and cIAP-1), which may explain its sensitization of tumor cells to rhLTα and/or cisplatin/adriamycin. ©2007 Landes Bioscience.

Taking traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-Rhizoma Corydalis as an example, the chromatographic retention parameters and peak shape parameters of 24 compounds were studied. After recognition of each peak under five different linear gradient conditions, the binary parameters equation was established to calculate the retention parameters on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with 2.1 mm i.d. column packed with 1.7 μm particles. And further retention times under other binary gradient conditions were predicted. The largest relative error of predicted retention time for each compound in R. Corydalis was 0.75%. The exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) model and automatic peak curve-fitting method were used to resolve the overlapping peaks, to calculate the peak shape parameters and to obtain the peak shape rules.

52149117578	Platinums sensitize human epithelial tumor cells to lymphotoxin α by inhibiting NFκB-dependent transcription	Lymphotoxin α (LTα) was first identified as a direct anti-tumor factor, whereas increasing evidence has recently shown that in most cases the growth inhibition mediated by LTα requires the synergistic action of other factors, such as RNA transcription or protein synthesis inhibitor. In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of LTα and ten chemotherapeutic drugs on cell growth in a panel of human epithelial tumor cells, and explored the molecular mechanism of their mutual action. The results showed that platinums (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin) are more universally effective than other chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin, epi-doxorubicin, 5-flourouracil, mitomycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and vinorelbine) to enhance the response of six human epithelial tumor cell lines (A375, Bcap37, NCI-H157, SW480, BGC-823 and HeLa) to LTα. A systemic treatment with a combination of LTα and cisplatin in a human Bcap37 breast cancer xenograft nude mice model dramatically improved the therapeutic efficacy of LTα. Further analysis revealed that the sensitization of platinums was associated with platinums-induced suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFκB) and subsequent downregulation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), which rescued caspase-3 from inhibition. Our results suggested that a proper combination of bio-agents such as LTα and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs such as platinums may be an efficient treatment strategy for human epithelial cancers. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

53049094346	Novel two-dimensional reversed-phase liquid chromatography/hydrophilic interaction chromatography, an excellent orthogonal system for practical analysis	A novel two-dimensional reversed-phase liquid chromatography/hydrophilic interaction chromatography (2D-RPLC/HILIC) system is developed with the introduction of the click β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) stationary phase. The offline system shows excellent abilities for the separation of polar and medium-polarity components in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It facilitates us not only to separate components that cannot be resolved by uni-dimensional chromatography, but also to achieve much more efficient detection of components with low abundance. The orthogonality of this new system is excellent. A simple geometric approach is developed to characterize the practical orthogonality of 2D-LC in the analysis of complex unknown samples. The mathematical characterization results are in good accordance with the experimental findings, and both demonstrate that the proposed 2D-RPLC/HILIC system is a powerful tool for the separation of polar and medium-polarity complex samples. This system may have a great potential for the separation of peptides and metabolomic compounds with similar polarity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental results show that the contents of major components of all samples decocted together are higher than those of Danshen. The contents of Danshen major components are the highest in classic formula (the mass ratio of Danshen to Sanqi is 5: 3). Therefore, Danshen decocted together with Sanqi at a ratio of 5 : 3 can increase the dissolution ability of Danshen ingredients. This, therefore, could constitute a solid rationale to the compatibility rule in Chinese traditional medicine with both scientific merits and intrinsic reasoning.

The LC retention parameters of 34 components were obtained quickly by using three linear gradient elutions. Overlapping separation range map (OSRM), which is related to the separation quality and the analysis time, was utilized to search the optimised stepwise gradient method for HPLC analysis of flavones of Astragalus. Finally, the optimised stepwise gradient elution conditions were set up with the help of this map. Under the optimised conditions, the sample of flavones of Astragalus was well separated in reasonable time. The method is more convenient than that using a series of isocratic elutions.

The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 16-row multislice CTA in detecting intracranial aneurysms compared with 2D-DSA and surgical findings. Methods: One hundred fifty-two consecutive patients were included in the study and successively underwent 16-slice CTA, 2D-DSA, and surgery in some patients. This was performed with a 16-row multislice CT machine, detector slice of 0.75 mm, reconstruction interval of 0.40 mm, and timing determined by bolus trigger. The 16-slice CTA and 2D-DSA results were evaluated independently by 3 different neuroradiologists who performed aneurysm detection using MIP, SSD, and VRT. Results: With the combination of 16-slice CTA, 2D-DSA, and intraoperative findings, 92 aneurysms were detected in 86 of the 152 patients. Two aneurysms were missed when 16-slice CTA was used. Three aneurysms were not clearly depicted at 2D-DSA, but proven at surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity between 16-slice CTA and 2D-DSA (P = 1.0). The sensitivity of 16-slice CTA for detecting aneurysms <4 mm, between 4 and 10 mm, and >10 mm was 96% (95% CI: 79.6%-99.9%), 98.1% (95% CI: 89.7%-100%), and 100% (95% CI: 78.2%-100%), respectively, on a per-aneurysm basis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 16-slice CTA for detecting aneurysms were 97.8% (95% CI: 92.4%-99.7%), 100% (95% CI: 94.6%-100%), and 98.7% (95% CI: 95.5%-99.8%), respectively, on a per-aneurysm basis. Conclusion: Sixteen-slice CTA shows promising diagnostic accuracy that appears to be comparable with 2D-DSA for the detection of suspected intracranial aneurysms, and 16-slice CTA is sensitive enough to replace 2D-DSA in detecting aneurysms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

61649094922	Retention properties of novel β-CD bonded stationary phases in reversed-phase HPLC mode	With the given special structures, the CD bonded stationary phases are expected to have complementary retention properties with conventional C18 stationary phase, which will be helpful to enhance the polar selectivity in RP mode separation. In this work, two β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) bonded stationary phases for reversed-phase HPLC, including 1, 12-dodecyldiol linked β-CD stationary phase (CD1) and olio (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linked β-CD stationary phase (CD2), have been synthesized via click chemistry. The resulting materials were characterized with FT-IR and elemental analysis, which proved the successful immobilization of ligands. The similarities and differences in retention characteristics between the CD and C18 stationary phases have been elucidated by using comparative linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs). The force related to solute McGowan volume has no significant difference, while the hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions between solutes and CD stationary phases are stronger than between solutes and C18, which is attributed to the special structures (CD and triazole groups) of CD stationary phases. Chemical origins are interpreted by comparison between CD1 and CD2. Similar dispersive interactions of CD1 and CD2 are attributed to their similar length of spacer arms. CD2 which contains OEG spacer arm has relative weaker HBD acidity but stronger HBA basicity. CD stationary phases display no serious different methylene selectivity and higher polar selectivity than in the case of C18. Higher acid selectivity and lower basic selectivity are observed on CD2 than on CD1. Distinctive retention properties and good complementary separation selectivity to C18 make the novel CD bonded stationary phases available for more application in RPLC. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

QCS and poly (aspartic acid) were processed to nanoparticles via the ionotropic gelation technique. The size, polydispersity, zeta potential, and morphology of the nanoparticles were characterized. Entrapment studies of the nanoparticles were conducted using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein. The effects of the pH value of nanoparticles with different QCS/poly (aspartic acid) ratios, QCS molecular weight (MW), poly (aspartic acid) concentration, and BSA concentration on the nanoparticle size, the nanoparticle yield, and BSA encapsulation were studied in detail. Suitably pH value of nanoparticles with different QCS/poly (aspartic acid) ratios, moderate QCS MW, optimal concentration ratio of poly (aspartic acid), and QCS favored more nanoparticles formed and higher BSA encapsulation efficiency. The release of BSA from nanoparticles was pH-dependent. Fast release occurred in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4), while the release was slow in 0.1 M HCl (pH 1.2).

The synthetic procedure is simple and controllable. Different-sized CdTe QDs with controllable photoluminescence (PL) wavelengths from 500 to 610 nm can be synthesized within 5 h in aqueous solutions at a temperature of 100 °C. When the molar ratio of GSH to TGA is 1:1, quantum yields (QY) of the yellow-emitting CdTe QD550 (QDs with emission maximum at 550 nm) obtained can reach to 63% without any postpreparation treatment. The synthesized CdTe QDs possess free carboxyl and amino groups, which were successfully conjugated with insulin (INS) for delivery to cells, demonstrating that they can be easily bound bimolecularly and have potentially broad applications as bioprobes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Lactate dehydrogenase release assay and cell detachment index were used to monitor cytotoxicity. Changes in fibrogenic molecular markers were observed by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction and high-content imaging analysis of immunofluorescence.Results. Three flavonoids (quercetin, baicalein and baicalin) and two non-flavonoids (salvianolic acid B and emodin) demonstrated anti-fibrotic activities in both total collagen accumulation and nodule formation assays. The remaining 16 compounds had little anti-fibrotic effect or were cytotoxic. The anti-fibrotic compounds suppressed collagen I expression at both mRNA and protein levels and also variably suppressed α-smooth muscle actin expression and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Methanol extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge and Rheum palmatum L., which are rich sources of baicalein, baicalin, salvianolic acid B and emodin, respectively, also showed in vitro anti-fibrotic activities.Conclusions. Five herbal compounds and three herbal extracts have in vitro anti-fibrotic activities. These data warrant further studies on these anti-fibrotic entities and suggest it a promising strategy to discover new anti-fibrotic drugs by screening more plant materials.

70450174897	Development of orthogonal two-dimensional hydrophilic interaction chromatography systems with the introduction of novel stationary phases	Two different offline 2-D hydrophilic interaction chromatography (2D-HILIC/HILIC) systems have been developed. In the two systems, a click maltose column was used in the first dimension, an amide column or a click β-CD column was used in the second dimension, respectively. Both of the systems were used for the analysis of very polar components in Carthamus tinctorius Linn., which is a traditional Chinese medicine. Excellent orthogonality and separation results were obtained in both 2D-HILIC/ HILIC systems, while the peak capacity of the system based on click maltose and amide column was higher for its adoption of stationary phase with smaller particle size in the second dimension. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

0035073727	Effects of cell fermentation time and biomass drying strategies on the recovery of poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates from Alcaligenes eutrophus using a surfactant-chelate aqueous system	In the course of poly-3-hydroxyalkanoate (PHAs) recovery from Alcaligenes. eutrophus by a surfactant and chelate method, a number of operating parameters, in addition to dosage of chemical agents, temperature and pH, might influence recovery results. The effects of cell culture time and drying strategy were investigated on poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) recovery. Increasing fermentation time was confirmed to benefit PHB/PHBV accumulation and recovery, but at the late fermentation, both the PHB/PHBV content and the recovered product purity were not clearly enhanced with the increased culture time. Experiments also indicated that the wet or 60° dried biomass could be utilized to recover PHB and PHBV, but the purity and molecular weight of the product were lower than using the lyophilized. By employing one of the following tactics (increasing the surfactant dose, raising the pH, increasing the temperature or lengthening the treatment time), the purity of recovered PHB/PHBV was significantly improved, which suggested another energy-saving strategy for drying biomass instead of freeze drying. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

7444262012	Comparison between acclimated and unacclimated biomass affecting anaerobic-aerobic transformations in the biological removal of phosphorus	Acclimated and unacclimated experiments were conducted with propionic/acetic acids wastewater and activated sludge (biomass) long-term cultured, respectively, with acetic and propionic acid enriched wastewater. Biomass acclimated with the propionic acid enriched wastewater, compared with unacclimated, had a increased specific soluble ortho-phosphate (SOP) release (increased from 0.75 to 0.91 mmol-P/g-MLVSS) and uptake (from 0.96 to 1.25 mmol-P/g-MLVSS), SOP-uptake/SOP-release ratio (from 1.28 to 1.38 mol/mol), net SOP removal (from 0.46 to 0.69 mmol/l) and SOP removal efficiency (from 61.33 to 92.00%). However, the ratios of both anaerobic accumulated and aerobic utilised polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) were reduced. The reasons for these changes were due to the decreased glycogen transformations and cell growth as well as increased phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAO) involved in the acclimated biomass. Further investigation indicates that the propionic acid enriched wastewater was less efficient for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) than acetic acid in short-term tests, but much more efficient in the long-term cultured experiments. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

77953100252	Stationary phases for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and their applications in separation of traditional Chinese medicines	Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is an alternative of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) for the separation of polar compounds. The main characteristic of HILIC is the use of polar stationary phases and aqueous/organic (usually acetonitrile) mobile phases. In recent years, HILIC has attracted more and more attentions for the demanding of the separation of polar compounds in many research fields and the advantages of HILIC, such as the good retention of polar compounds, orthogonality to RPLC and compatibility with mass spectrometry (MS), etc. Stationary phases are the basis of the development and application of HILIC. The structure of the bonded phases, retention properties and applications of the HILIC stationary phases are reviewed in the present article. The conventional stationary phases for normal phase liquid chromatography used in HILIC and the stationary phases specially developed for HILIC are introduced. The advantages, drawbacks and the general situation of applications of the different stationary phases are commented. The applications in the separation of traditional Chinese medicines are also reviewed. The further development of HILIC stationary phases is looked ahead.

77955577648	Levonorgestrel inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in uterine leiomyoma cells	Background: The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a widely recognized intrauterine anti-fertility system, which can alleviate symptoms of uterine leiomyoma. This study aims to evaluate leimyoma cell growth inhibition induced by high concentrations of LNG. Study Design: After treatment with LNG, the growth rate of the cultured primary uterine leiomyoma cells was studied with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis rate was determined by morphological changes and flow cytometry. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were performed to measure the differential mRNA and protein expression levels. Results: The proliferation rate of uterine leiomyoma cells was suppressed after treatment with LNG at a minimum concentration of 10 mcg/mL. The inhibitive effect was positively correlated with the LNG concentration and with the incubation time. Flow cytometry showed that the apoptosis rate was increased with the LNG concentration. The mRNA levels of IGF-1, Bcl-2 and survivin were down-regulated significantly after treatment with 10 mcg/mL LNG. Western blot analysis confirmed that the expression of Bcl-2 and survivin was decreased significantly, and the p38 phosphorylation level was increased and caspase 3 was activated remarkably 72 h after treatment with 10 and 20 mcg/mL LNG. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that LNG may suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis of the uterine leiomyoma cells. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77954922518	Chemically bonded maltose via click chemistry as stationary phase for HILIC	A HILIC stationary phase was synthesized through bonding maltose on silica particles via click chemistry. A set of representative polar compounds including sugars, amino acids and small peptides were employed to evaluate chromatographic properties of Click Maltose. The results illustrated the surface adsorption mechanism from the direct hydrogen bonding interaction between sugars and Click Maltose played an important role on retention behavior of sugars under HILIC mode. The chromatographic behavior of anions on Click Maltose was consistent with HILIC/WAX mechanism, while the retention of cations was depended on electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) mechanism. The Click Maltose stationary phase was successfully used in the separation of standard samples of polar compounds and complex samples of oligosaccharides from the natural product. The Click Maltose also exhibited good reproducibility and stability, which were helpful to further application. Our study confirmed the advantages and application potential of bonded oligosaccharides for HILIC separation. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

In the curve of the distribution of the X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the special PXRL, there was a plateau with a diameter of 21.3 μm in which the distribution of the X-ray intensity was homogeneous. The gain in flux density in the plateau of the PXRL is 1490. The uniformity of this plateau was 2.9%. This was helpful for the quantitative X-ray fluorescence analysis of a single aerosol particle with smaller size than that of the plateau of the PXRL. The fingerprint database of aerosol particles with given sizes from various air pollution sources was established with the single particle analysis method. The size-resolved source apportionment of aerosol particles in haze in Beijing city was performed with this fingerprint database. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

78049442793	Association of Shp2 with phosphorylated IL-22R1 is required for interleukin-22-induced MAP kinase activation	Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines produced by activated T cells and is involved in several tissue responses. IL-22 signals through a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1) and IL-10R2, and the intracellular signaling pathways mediated by IL-22 receptor are not completely known. Here we investigate the effect of Src homology-2 containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (Shp2) on IL-22 signaling pathway using SW480 colon cancer cells as a model. The results show that IL-22 induces IL-22R1 phosphorylation, and Shp2 is recruited to the tyrosine phosphorylated IL-22R1 upon IL-22 stimulation. Furthermore, Tyr251 and Tyr301 of IL-22R1 are required for Shp2 binding to the IL-22R1. Shp2 binding to IL-22R1 and Shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase activity are required for activation of MAP kinases and signal transducer and activatorof transcription (STAT3) phosphorylation by IL-22. These results reveal a critical role of Shp2 in IL-22 mediated signal transduction pathways. © The Author (2010).

78649647290	Anti-hepatic fibrosis effect of total flavone from Litchi chinensis Sonn in rats with bile duct occlusion	AIM: To determine whether total flavone from Litchi chinensis Sonn (TFL) has antihepatic fibrosis effects in a rat model of bile duct occlusion (BDO) and to explore potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: Hepatic fibrosis was induced in rats by common bile duct ligation. TFL was orally given to fibrotic rats at a dose of 200 or 100 mg/(kg·d). Silymarin was used as a positive control. Four weeks later, serum level of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN) and procollagen type III (PC III) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA); the degree of liver fibrosis was evaluated by HE staining and Masson collagen staining; and the expression of TRAIL in liver tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry using the streptavidin-biotin enzyme complex (SABC) method. RESULTS: Serum levels of TRAIL, HA, LN and PC III were significantly lower in the high-dose TFL group, sham-operation group and silymarin group than in the model group (all P < 0.05) though that was no significant difference between the low-dose TFL group and model group (P > 0.05). Serum TRAIL level is correlated with hepatic TRAIL expression level. Serum TRAIL level also has a positive correlation with serum levels of HA, LN and PC III. The degree of liver fibrosis was significantly improved in the high-dose TFL group and silymarin group. CONCLUSION: TFL at a dose of 200 mg/(kg·d) can inhibit the expression of TRAIL, HA, LN and PC III and improve the degree of liver fibrosis in rats with hepatic fibrosis.

78449246241	Role and possible mechanism of NF-κB in tumorigenesis of prostate cancer	Prostatitis is a risk factor of prostate cancer. Nuclear factor-κ (NF-κB) plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer induced by prostatitis. Hypoxia, a marker of inflammation, and Toll like receptors both can activate NF-κB. Inflammatory cells can regulate the biological behavior of tumors through NF-κB. Moreover, NF-κB has a cross-talk with many pro-inflammatory factors. NF-κB regulates tumor growth through various ways, including apoptosis promotion and proliferation suppression, mediation of invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of tumors; NF-κB also can induce progression of prostate cancer from the androgen-dependent to the androgen-independent stage. Anti-inflammation and NF-κB-targeting therapies cast new lights on prostate cancer treatment, which deserves further study.

The effects of the pH value of nanoparticles, QCS molecular weight (Mw) and poly(aspartic acid) concentration on GLA encapsulation were studied. Suitably pH value of nanoparticles, moderate QCS MW, optimal concentration ratio of poly(aspartic acid) and QCS favored higher GLA encapsulation efficiency. The release of GLA from nanoparticles was pH-dependent. Fast release occurred in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7.4), while the release was slow in 0.1 M HCI (pH = 1.2). The results showed that the new QCS/poly(aspartic acid) nanoparticles have a promising potential in GLA delivery system. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers.

Methods: A recombinant lentiviral plasmid PLJM1-Napsin A was constructed, then transfected into A549 cell and identified. A549 cells EMT model was established by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) treatment in vitro. The morphology change was observed under inverted microscopy successively. To observe the degree of EMT by TGF-β1 intervening A549 cells, the expression of E-cadherin and collagen type I was detected by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Finally, in order to investigate the mechanism, the protein expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was detected by Western blotting. Results The result of sequencing the recombinant lentiviral plasmid PLJM1-Napsin A was predicted as designed. The expression of Napsin A protein in transgenic A549 cells was more than that in A549 cells and A549-PLJM1 cells (P < 0. 01). After TGF-β1 treatment, the cells changed from epithelial-shaped into interstitial-shaped; TGF-β1 induced EMT in A549 cells, as demonstrated by significant reduction of E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels (P < 0. 01) as well as up-regulation of collagen type I (P < 0.01). Transfection of Napsin A in A549 cells could not only restrain the TGF-β1-induced morphological changes, but also partially block the TGF-β1-induced expression of E-caherin (P <0. 01) and collagen type I (P<0. 05) expression. In EMT model in vitro, TGF-β1 treatment significantly induced the expression of FAK (P < 0. 01), but this induction was significantly blocked by Napsin A overexpression (P < 0. 01). Conclusion It could partially block EMT by Napsin A gene transfection into A549 cells, and the mechanism might be associated with the inhibition of integrin signaling pathway.

79959459891	MiR-148a inhibits angiogenesis by targeting ERBB3	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in carcinogenesis in various solid cancers including breast cancer. Down-regulation of microRNA-148a (miR-148a) has been reported in certain cancer types. However, the biological role of miR-148a and its related targets in breast cancer are unknown yet. In this study, we showed that the level of miR-148a was lower in MCF7 cells than that in MCF10A cells. V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) is a direct target of miR-148a in human breast cancer cells through direct binding of miR-148a to ERBB3 3′-UTR region. Overexpression of miR-148a in MCF7 cells inhibited ERBB3 expression, blocked the downstream pathway activation including activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and p70S6K1, and decreased HIF-1α expression. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-148a attenuated tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Our results identify ERBB3 as a direct target of miR-148a, and provide direct evidence that miR-148a inhibits tumor angiogenesis through ERBB3 and its downstream signaling molecules. This information would be helpful for targeting the miR-148a/ERBB3 pathway for breast cancer prevention and treatment in the future. © 2011 The Editorial Board of Journal of Biomedical Research.

79959708906	A literature-based meta-analysis taxane-based doublet versus single-agent taxane chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer	Purpose: Clinical trials have reported conflicting results as to whether taxane-based doublet improves outcome over single-agent taxane in patients with advanced breast cancer. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis comparing primary and secondary end points of taxane-based doublet with single-agent taxane chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer and prior anthracycline treatment. The event-based relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was derived, and a test of heterogeneity was applied. Results: Four eligible trials (2,343 patients) were selected from 488 studies that initially were identified. A significant difference in favoring taxane-based doublet over single-agent taxane was observed in progression-free survival (PFS) (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75; P = 0.039) and partial response (PR) (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.10-1.86; P = 0.008). The ORR was higher for patients receiving taxane-based doublet, although not statistically significant (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.91-1.50; P = 0.220). Whereas there was no difference in 1-year survival rate (1-year SR) (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.17; P = 0.422), clinical benefit (CB) (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95-1.09; P = 0.642), and complete response (CR) (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.31-1.79; P = 0.512). Toxicities did not differ significantly except stomatitis and diarrhea. Conclusion: Taxane-based doublet appeared to improve PFS and PR compared with single-agent taxane in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.

These celadon shards were fired during the period of the Late Yuan Dynasty to the Tianshun era of the Ming Dynasty, as identified by archaeologists at Nanjing Museum. In order to research the chemical composition features of this ancient celadon porcelain, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) for non-destructive analysis was used to determine the chemical composition of the porcelain body and glaze in these shards. The results indicate that Ti and Fe in the body of Longquan celadon are characteristic elements which can distinguish porcelain produced during the Late Yuan Dynasty from those produced in the Ming Dynasties. The results of the principal component analysis (PCA) show that different body and glaze raw materials were used for the production of porcelain in different periods and the raw materials of the body and glaze are also different for various vessel shapes.

The purpose of this study was to review the existing literature on the accuracy of Tc-99m MIBI in the diagnosis of breast cancer. After a systematic review of English-language studies, the sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy of Tc-99m MIBI in the diagnosis of breast cancer were pooled using random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize the overall test performance. Forty-five studies met our inclusion criteria. The summary estimates for Tc-99m MIBI in the diagnosis of breast cancer in the studies included were as follows: sensitivity, 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-0.84]; specificity, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.86); positive likelihood ratio, 5.06 (95% CI, 4.26-6.01); negative likelihood ratio, 0.20 (95% CI, 0.17-0.24); and diagnostic odds ratio, 27.63 (95% CI, 21.63-36.10). For patients with a palpable mass, the sensitivity and specificity were 87 and 86%, respectively. For patients without a palpable mass, the sensitivity and specificity were 59 and 89%, respectively. Tc-99m MIBI has a high level of overall accuracy for the diagnosis of breast cancer. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

83155172530	High prevalence of Entamoeba infections in captive long-tailed macaques in China	Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are bred in China for export and for use in experiments. Entamoeba infections in captive long-tailed macaques were surveyed in one of the biggest colonies located in Guangxi Province, China. One stool sample was obtained from each of the 152 different cages representing >3,000 macaques in the colony. The samples were examined by PCR for five Entamoeba species. The number of detected Entamoeba coli infections comprised 94% of the samples, 93% for Entamoeba chattoni, and 83% for Entamoeba dispar. In contrast, Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba nuttalli were not detected. Six isolates of E. dispar were obtained by culture in Tanabe-Chiba medium. Analysis of serinerich protein genes in these isolates showed two genotypes, one of which is identical to that of the E. dispar SAW760 strain in humans. This suggests transmission of E. dispar between humans and nonhuman primates. These results demonstrate that Entamoeba infections are common, but virulent Entamoeba species are absent in this colony. This work also confirms the need for monitoring with PCRbased identification of Entamoeba species for captive macaques in breeding colonies to ensure animal health and protection of humans from zoonotic hazards. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

83355177979	Anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel through dual-targeting carrier of cyclic RGD and transferrin conjugated hyperbranched copolymer nanoparticles	Targeted delivery strategies are becoming increasingly important. Herein, a novel hyperbranched amphiphilic poly[(amine-ester)-co-(d,l-lactide)]/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine copolymer (HPAE-co-PLA/DPPE) with RGD peptide (cRGDfK) and transferrin (Tf) on the periphery was synthesized and used to prepare paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for dual-targeting chemotherapy. These NPs show satisfactory size distribution, high encapsulated efficiency and a pH-dependent release profile. The intrinsic fluorescence of the hyperbranched copolymer renders the detection and tracking of NPs in vitro and in vivo conveniently. In vitro cytotoxicity studies proved that the presence of cRGDfK enhanced the cytotoxic efficiency by 10 folds in α

83655211739	Size-resolved source apportionment of aerosol particles with a confocal micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometer	A laboratory confocal micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) spectrometer based on a polycapillary focusing X-ray lens (PFXRL) in the excitation channel and a polycapillary parallel X-ray lens (PPXRL) in the detection channel was used to carry out the size-resolved source apportionment of aerosol particles. The PPXRL in the detection channel both increased the collection angle of the detector and improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the X-ray spectrum. When this confocal micro- XRF spectrometer was used to carry out the quantitative XRF analysis of single aerosol particles with smaller size than that of the overlapping foci of the PFXRL and the PPXRL, the sensitivity was corrected by using a Gaussian function. The size-resolved "fingerprint database" for the air pollution sources was established based on the quantitative XRF results for single aerosol particles. The size-resolved aerosol particles on hazyfoggy days in Beijing were apportioned. © 2011 Society for Applied Spectroscopy.

84355166783	Lipid partitioning after uninephrectomy	This longitudinal study addressed the sequential events and metabolic consequences of lipid partitioning following uninephrectomy. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into sham operation (n = 15) or left uninephrectomy (UNX, n = 18). At 1 and 3 months post nephrectomy, three rats from each group were killed for histopathological examination of adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. Renal protein expression of the lipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and adiponectin receptor was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. Blood lipids, glucose, insulin, and renal functions were longitudinally measured up to 10 months after operation. The UNX rats progressively developed lipodystrophy of subcutaneous and visceral adipose depots with failure of adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage, followed by blood lipid elevation and ectopic lipid deposition with cellular lipid peroxidation, and renal adipogenesis with chronic inflammatory infiltration. Despite having standard diet, normal food consumption and normal body weight, the uninephrectomized rats with defective lipid partitioning manifested a myriad of homeostatic disturbances including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, adiponectin resistance, and upregulation of PPAR-γ and HMGCR. Abnormal lipid partitioning from adipose depots to circulation and non-adipose tissues and non-adipocytic cells contributes to homeostatic disturbances and lipogenic activation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84855387479	Characterization of diethylnitrosamine-induced liver carcinogenesis in Syrian golden hamsters	The aim of this study was to characterize hepatocarcinogenesis in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated hamsters. Syrian golden hamsters (n=36) were administered DEN by hypodermic injection and addition to drinking water. Morphological analyses, including light microscopy and immunohistochemistry of a-fetal protein (AFP), were performed on liver and lung tissues. Primary cell culture and tumor transplantation were carried out to evaluate the potential application in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) research. From 25 to 50 weeks of treatment, liver tumors, including macronodular HCC and ascites, were found in one-third (4/12) of the animals treated with DEN. HCC was characterized by poor differentiation, frequent mitosis, AFP reaction, vessel invasion and potential application in primary cell culture and xenotransplantation. Pre-neoplastic lesions were hyperplastic nodules comprised of clear cells, bile duct proliferation, fatty metamorphosis and multilocular cysts. The DEN-treated hamsters also showed lung tumors consisting of AFP-negative, well-differentiated neoplastic cells. Characterization of DEN-induced HCC in hamsters provides insights into human hepatocarcinogenesis. This animal model has potential applications in HCC research.

84860603272	Spiral CT diagnosis of gastric stromal tumor	Objective: To assess CT diagnostic value of gastric stromal tumor (GST). Methods: Clinical data and spiral CT findings of 20 patients with pathologically proven GST were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Twenty lesions were solitary in plain CT scan image. The malignant lesions (n=9) were larger than 5.0 cm in diameter and cystic degenerations as well as necrosis were detected within the tumors, while the underlying malignant lesions (n=11) were smaller than 5.0 cm in diameter and most of them showed homogeneous density. Calcification was detected in 2 patients. On enhanced CT scan, the substantial part of the lesions was obviously strengthened. Multiplanar reformation displayed the relationship of tumor and stomach clearly. Conclusion: The CT imaging features of gastric stromal tumor are characteristic. Plain CT scan and multiplanar reformation are helpful to determine the location and nature of gastric stromal tumors.

84861129086	Efficient delivery of antitumor drug to the nuclei of tumor cells by amphiphilic biodegradable poly(L -Aspartic Acid-co-Lactic Acid)/DPPE co-polymer nanoparticles	The use of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) for controlled drug delivery has shown significant therapeutic potential. Polyaspartic acid and polylactic acid are the most intensively studied biodegradable polymers. In the present study, novel amphiphilic biodegradable co-polymer NPs, poly(L-aspartic acid-co-lactic acid) with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) (poly(AA-co-LA)/DPPE) is synthesized and subsequently used to encapsulate an antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX). The formulation parameters of the NPs are optimized to improve encapsulation efficiency. The resulting drug-loaded NPs possess better size homogeneity (polydispersity) and exhibit pH-responsive drug release profiles. Cellular viability assays indicate that the poly(AA-co-LA)/DPPE NPs did not induce cell death, whereas doxorubicin encapsulated NPs were cytotoxic to various types of tumor cells. In addition, the free NPs could not enter the cell nuclei after internalized in tumor cells. The DOX-loaded NPs exhibit efficient intracellular delivery in tumor cells with co-localization in lysosome and delay entering into the nucleus, which suggests a time- and pH-dependent drug release profile within cells. When applied to deliver chemotherapeutics to a mouse xenograft model of human lung adenocarcinoma, DOX-loaded NPs have a comparable antitumor activity with free DOX, and greatly reduce systemic toxicity and mortality. The delivery of cytotoxic drugs directly to the nucleus specifically within tumor cells is of great interest. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the application of the amphiphilic polyaspartic acid derivative, poly(AA-co-LA)/DPPE, as a nanocarrier for cell nuclear delivery of potent antitumor drugs.

84862488979	Oral administration of apigenin inhibits metastasis through AKT/P70S6K1/MMP-9 pathway in orthotopic ovarian tumor model	Apigenin, a flavonoid commonly present in the daily diet, is known for its potential anti-tumor properties. However, the effect of apigenin via oral administration on tumor growth and metastasis remains unknown. In this study we developed an orthotopic ovarian tumor model in nude mice to test the effect of apigenin oral administration, and showed that apigenin inhibited the micrometastasis of cancer cells in the animal tumor model. To understand the mechanism of apigenin in inhibiting metastasis, we found that apigenin greatly inhibited MMP-9 expression and p-AKT and p-p70S6K1 levels in the tumor tissues compared to the control group. We further demonstrated that the downregulation of MMP-9 by apigenin was mediated by the AKT/p70S6K1 pathway. These findings help to address the question with common interests to the public of whether oral uptake of flavonoids is effective in preventing cancer. Our results demonstrate for the first time that oral uptake of apigenin can inhibit tumor metastasis through MMP-9 expression using the orthotopic ovarian tumor model. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

METHODS: From Jan. 2006 to Dec. 2009, 76 patients with ovarian cancer in II-IVstage after cytoreductive surgery were analyzed retrospectively. And 36 ovarian cancer patients were treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin chemotherapy and intravenous paclitaxel chemotherapy(treatment group). Totally 40 ovarian cancer patients accepted intravenous chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel(control group). The progression free survival(PFS), survival rate and adverse reaction of two groups were observed. RESULTS: The PFS in treatment group was 27 months, The PFS in control group was 23 months, the differences was significant (P<0.05). One, two and three year survival rates in treatment and control group were 97.22%(35/36), 94.44%(34/36) and 88.88%(32/36) respectively, that in IV group were 95.00%(38/40), 90.00%(36/40) and 77.50%(31/40) respectively. Vomiting and renal function failure was obviously lower and stomachache was obviously higher in intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy group than the control group. CONCLUSION: The postoperative intraperitoneal cisplatin chemotherapy combined with intravenous paclitaxel chemotherapy has obviously prolonged PFS and survival rate, light toxicity and of patients with the moderately or advanced ovarian cancer, and is well worth clinical popularizing and application.

84862908024	MiR-145 directly targets p70S6K1 in cancer cells to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis	MiR-145 can regulate cell apoptosis, proliferation, neural development and stem cell differentiation. Previous studies indicate that miR-145 is downregulated in human colon cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of miR-145 used to regulate colon carcinogenesis and angiogenesis remain to be clarified. Here, we show that the expression of miR-145 is downregulated in colon and ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. MiR-145 inhibits p70S6K1 post-transcriptional expression by binding to its 3′-UTR. The angiogenic factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are downstream molecules of p70S6K1, are decreased by miR-145 overexpression. P70S6K1 rescues miR-145-suppressed HIF-1 and VEGF levels, tumorigenesis and tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, the miR-145 level is inversely correlated with the amount of p70S6K1 protein in colon cancer tissues. Taken together, these studies suggest that miR-145 serves as a tumor suppressor which downregulates HIF-1 and VEGF expression by targeting p70S6K1, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis. The miR-145 rescue could be a rationale for therapeutic applications in colon cancer in the future. © The Author(s) 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

84864230998	Overexpression of the DEC1 protein induces senescence in vitro and is related to better survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in China and has limited effective therapeutic options except for early surgery, since the underlying molecular mechanism driving its precursor lesions towards invasive ESCC is not fully understood. Cellular senescence is the state of the permanent growth arrest of a cell, and is considered as the initial barrier of tumor development. Human differentiated embryo chondrocyte expressed gene 1 (Dec1) is an important transcription factor that related to senescence. In this study, DEC1 immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tissue microarray blocks constructed from ESCC combined with adjacent precursor tissues of 241 patients. Compared with normal epithelia, DEC1 expression was significantly increased in intraepithelial neoplasia and DEC1 expression was significantly decreased in ESCC in comparison with intraepithelial neoplasia. In vitro, DEC1 overexpression induced cellular senescence, and it inhibited cell growth and colony formation in ESCC cell line EC9706. Fresh esophagectomy tissue sections from five ESCC patients were detected by immunohistochemistry of DEC1 and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity, and strongly positive expression of DEC1 was correlated to more senescent cells in these fresh tissue sections. Kaplan - Meier method analysis of the 241 patients revealed that DEC1 expression levels were significantly correlated with the survival of ESCC patients after surgery. The expression levels of DEC1 were also correlated with age, tumor embolus, depth of invasion of ESCC, lymph metastasis status and pTNMs. These results suggest that DEC1 overexpression in precursor lesions of ESCC is a protective mechanism by inducing cellular senescence in ESCC initiation, and DEC1 may be a potential prognostic marker of ESCC. © 2012 Xu et al.

Methods: Primary ASMCs were cultured by the method of cell digestion. Cell culture supernatant of RTE cells were collected by TNF-α stimulation of epithelial cells. Detected the IL-8 and RANTES levels in the supernatant. The effect of TLR4/PI3K-related signaling molecules on the migration of asthmatic ASMCs induced by epithelial cells were detected by Modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber with anti-TLR4 antibody, Wortmannin and PDTC drugs as a tool. Results: The levels of IL-8 and RANTES in the supernatant of TNF-αgroups were significantly increased, and that in the 20 ng/ml group was significantly higher than other groups (P < 0.01). Compared with control group, the transmembrane migration of asthmatic ASMCs from other groups was significantly increased (P < 0.01). The transmembrane migration of asthmatic ASMCs from treated groups was significantly increased than asthma group (P < 0.01). The migration of asthmatic ASMCs from TNF-α+anti-TLR4 antibody group, TNF-α+ Wortmannin group and TNF-α + Wortmannin + PDTC were significantly decreased than that of TNF-αgroup(P < 0.01). The migration of asthmatic ASMCs from TNF-α+Wortmannin+PDTC were significantly decreased than that of TNF-α+Wortmannin group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: TLR4/PI3K-relat-ed signaling molecules involved in the transmembrane migration of asthmatic ASMCs induced by airway epithelial cells and may be one of the mechanisms of airway remodeling of asthma.

84865644657	Inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cell by transfected Napsin A	Background Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a cellular process characterized by the loss of cell adhesion, inhibition of E-cadherin expression, and increased cell mobility. Cells without Napsin A are susceptible to transition. Further studies are required to investigate whether this transition can be reversed by restoration of Napsin A. Methods A Napsin A expression vector PLJM1-Napsin A plasmid was constructed and then transfected into the epithelial cell line A549 by lentivirus transfection to obtain A549-PLJM1-Napsin A cell line. Cell proliferation was assayed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide and cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry. The E-cadherin, type I collagen, and focal adhesion kinase mRNA level was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The Napsin A, E-cadherin, type I collagen, and focal adhesion kinase protein level in A549 cells was detected by Western blotting. Results Transforming growth factor-β1 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cells, as demonstrated by significant reduction of E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels (P <0.01) as well as up-regulation of type I collagen (P <0.01). Transfection of Napsin A in A549 cells can partially block the transforming growth factor-β1-regulated expression of E-cadherin and type I collagen (P <0.01).

Methods: Ninety-seven patients were confirmed operatively and pathologically. Enhanced CT scan was performed with intravenous injection bolus of approximately 75-120 ml (1-1.5 ml/kg body weight) contrast medium at a rate of 2.5-3 ml/s. In 68 patients receiving dual-phase scan, the delayed scan time of arterial and venous phases was 18-20 s and 60-70 s, respectively, and in 29 patients receiving three-phase scan, the delayed scan time of arterial, pancreatic and portal venous phases was 18 s, 40 s and 75 s, respectively, with a slice of 3-5 mm thickness, a pitch of 1-1.5, and a reconstruction interval of 2.5-4.8 mm. Results: Positive and negative predictive values of unresectable tumors were 97.65% and 75.86%, respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy were 90.67% and 90.72%, respectively. Positive predictive values of dual-phase and three-phase were 95.83% and 100%, respectively; negative predictive values were 75% and 77.78%, respectively. Conclusions: Spiral multi-phase CT is superior in revealing the involvement of peripancreatic vessels, the invasion of the neighboring organs, the size, shape and range of carcinoma, and the metastasis of liver and lymph node. The predictability of resection is obviously increased for patients with pancreatic carcinoma.

In this study, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce both ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression in vitro and in vivo. We also identify that miR-199a and miR-125b target ERBB2 and/or ERBB3 in ovarian cancer cells, and demonstrate that ROS inhibit miR-199a and miR-125b expression through increasing the promoter methylation of the miR-199a and miR-125b genes by DNA methyltransferase 1. These findings reveal that ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression is regulated by ROS via miR-199a and miR-125b downregulation and DNA hypermethylation. © 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization.

84871432529	Effect of Napsin A transfection into type II alveolar epithelial cells on pulmonary fibrosis	Objective: To study the in vitro effect and mechanism of Napsin A gene transfection into type II alveolar epithelial cells on pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: A recombinant lentiviral plasmid PLJM1-Napsin A was constructed and transfected into human type II alveolar epithelial cell line A549. The model of pulmonary fibrosis was established by the in vitro stimulation of A549 cells by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1). The morphological changes were observed continuously under inverted microscopy. The proliferation of transgenic and non-transgenic cells was detected by MTT. To observe the degree of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by TGF-β1 intervening A549 cells, the expressions of E-cadherin and fibronectin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Lastly the protein expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was detected by Western blot to investigate the mechanism. Results: The result of sequencing the recombinant lentiviral plasmid PLJM1-Napsin A was the same as the design sequence. Napsin A mRNA and protein were expressed in transgenic A549 cells(P < 0.01). The model of pulmonary fibrosis was established successfully based on the morphology of transformed interstitial cell. As compared with the control group, the proliferation rate of transgenic cells decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin significantly decreased in the model of pulmonary fibrosis(P < 0.01),while the expression of fibronectin markedly increased(P < 0.01). But the change rate of transgenic cells decreased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The expression of FAK was significantly elevated after the stimulation of TGF-β1 (P < 0.01). But the upward trend of the transgenic cells was smaller as compared with the control group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Pulmonary fibrosis may be suppressed by the transfection of Napsin A gene into type II alveolar epithelial cells. And the mechanism may be through the inhibition of integrin signal transduction. Copyright © 2010 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84872394879	Downregulation of miR-145 associated with cancer progression and VEGF transcriptional activation by targeting N-RAS and IRS1	MicroRNA-145 (miR-145) is downregulated in various tumor types. However, its mechanism in inhibiting tumor growth and angiogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that miR-145 was significantly downregulated in the plasma and cancer tumor tissues of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, and overexpression of miR-145 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. To understand the potential mechanism of miR-145 in inhibiting tumor growth, we showed that miR-145 blocked the activation of AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, and the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF via directly targeting N-RAS and IRS1, and VEGF is an important effector for tumor growth. Forced expression of N-RAS and IRS1 restored VEGF expression via transcriptional activation. MiR-145 also inhibited N-RAS and IRS1 expression to suppress AKT and ERK1/2 activation, and VEGF expression in mouse xenograft tumors. To test the clinical relevance of these results, we used 60 pairs of colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, analyzed the levels of miR-145, N-RAS and IRS1 expression in these tissues, and found that miR-145 levels were significantly inversely correlated with N-RAS and IRS1 levels in these colorectal cancer tissues, suggesting the important implication of our findings in translational application for colorectal cancer diagnostics and treatment in the future. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84874274333	Roles and Mechanism of miR-199a and miR-125b in Tumor Angiogenesis	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be involved in different aspects of cancer biology including tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we identified that two miRNAs, miR-199a and miR-125b were downregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-199a and miR-125b inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis associated with the decrease of HIF-1α and VEGF expression in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the levels of miR-199a and miR-125b were negatively correlated with VEGF mRNA levels in ovarian tissues. We further showed that direct targets of miR-199a and miR-125b HER2 and HER3 were functionally relevant. Forced expression of HER2 and HER3 rescued miR-199a- and miR-125b-inhibiting angiogenesis responses and Akt/p70S6K1/HIF-1α pathway. This study provides a rationale for new therapeutic approach to suppress tumor angiogenesis using miR-199a, miR-125b, or their mimics for ovarian cancer treatment in the future. © 2013 He et al.

84874306245	A regulatory circuit of miR-148a/152 and DNMT1 in modulating cell transformation and tumor angiogenesis through IGF-IR and IRS1	Dysregulation of microRNAs is a common feature in human cancers, including breast cancer (BC). Here we describe the epigenetic regulation of miR-148a and miR-152 and their impact on BC cells. Due to the hypermethylation of CpG island, the expression levels of both miR-148a and miR-152 (miR-148a/152) are decreased in BC tissues and cells. DNMT1, the DNA methyltransferase 1 for the maintenance methylation, is aberrantly up-regulated in BC and its overexpression is responsible for hypermethylation of miR-148a and miR-152 promoters. Intriguingly, we found that DNMT1 expression, which is one of the targets of miR-148a/152, is inversely correlated with the expression levels of miR-148a/152 in BC tissues. Those results lead us to propose a negative feedback regulatory loop between miR-148a/152 and DNMT1 in BC. More importantly, we demonstrate that IGF-IR and IRS1, often overexpressed in BC, are two novel targets of miR-148a/152. Overexpression of miR-148a or miR-152 significantly inhibits BC cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor angiogenesis via targeting IGF-IR and IRS1 and suppressing their downstream AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. Our results suggest a novel miR-148a/152-DNMT1 regulatory circuit and reveal that miR-148a and miR-152 act as tumor suppressors by targeting IGF-IR and IRS1, and that restoration of miR-148a/152 expression may provide a strategy for therapeutic application to treat BC patients. © 2012 © The Author (2012).

The chemical structure of the copolymer was determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Nanoprecipitation or emulsion/solvent evaporation was employed to prepare nanoparticles of this copolymer loaded with a lipophilic organophosphorus pesticide, chlorpyrifos. The nanoparticle size was adjusted to between 100 and 300 nm by varying the copolymer/chlorpyrifos mass ratio in the two nanoparticle preparation methods. The resulting nanoparticles exhibited high chlorpyrifos loading capacity (LC) and sustained release profiles. The nanoparticle size, loading content (LC), and encapsulation efficiency (EE) decreased with increasing mass ratio of copolymer to chlorpyrifos. Chlorpyrifos release was controlled by adjusting the ratio of copolymer to chlorpyrifos. The study showed that these chitosan-co-PLA-DPPE copolymer nanoparticles can be used as carriers for lipophilic pesticide delivery. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84876412615	Prevalence and genetic diversity of Entamoeba species infecting macaques in southwest China	Many colonies of macaques (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta) are maintained in China, especially in Guangxi and Guizhou. A total of 803 fresh stool samples infected with Entamoeba were obtained from three big colonies of macaques located in southwest China. The samples were examined for the presence of five Entamoeba species using PCR. Entamoeba nuttalli, Entamoeba dispar, Entamoeba coli, and Entamoeba chattoni infections were detected, but Entamoeba histolytica infection was not. This study is the first to report on the prevalence of E. nuttalli in wild macaques from China. Eighteen E. nuttalli isolates and five E. dispar isolates were obtained by culturing the samples in Tanabe-Chiba medium. The serine-rich protein (SRP), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), hexokinase (HXK), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), and phosphoglucomutase (PGM) genes of E. nuttalli isolates were compared with other reported isolates. The results showed clear differences among the Chinese E. nuttalli isolates and other isolates based on the SRP gene sequences. However, HXK, GPI, and PGM genes of these strains were similar to those of other isolates. The rRNA genes of E. coli and E. chattoni were also amplified and analyzed from these samples. The results suggested that host species might be a more important factor than geographic location in amebic genetic diversity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84877065903	Tet1 is required for Rb phosphorylation during G1/S phase transition	DNA methylation plays an important role in many biological processes, including regulation of gene expression, maintenance of chromatin conformation and genomic stability. TET-family proteins convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which indicates that these enzymes may participate in DNA demethylation. The function of TET1 has not yet been well characterized in somatic cells. Here, we show that depletion of Tet1 in NIH3T3 cells inhibits cell growth. Furthermore, Tet1 knockdown blocks cyclin D1 accumulation in G1 phase, inhibits Rb phosphorylation and consequently delays entrance to G1/S phase. Taken together, this study demonstrates that Tet1 is required for cell proliferation and that this process is mediated through the Rb pathway. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84878531290	Increased levels of microRNA-424 are associated with the pathogenesis of fetal growth restriction	Studies show a number of miRNAs are expressed in the placenta including miRNA-424, a hypoxia-regulated miRNA, suggesting miRNA-424 may have a potential regulatory role in fetal growth restriction (FGR). The levels of miRNA-424 and its target gene, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MEK1), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) were examined. The levels of miRNA-424 were significantly increased in placentae from women with FGR. Both mRNA levels and protein levels of MEK1 and FGFR1 were significantly reduced in placentae complicated with FGR. Furthermore, the increased levels of miRNA-424 were negatively correlated with the mRNA levels of MEK1 in placentae complicated with FGR. Our study suggests upregulated miRNA-424 may be associated with the pathogenesis of FGR. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84880306518	Repression of miR-143 Mediates Cr (VI)-Induced Tumor Angiogenesis via IGF-IR/IRS1/ERK/IL-8 Pathway	Hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] is a well-known human carcinogen associated with the increased risk of lung cancer. However, the mechanism underlying the Cr (VI)-induced carcinogenesis remains unclear due to the lack of suitable experimental models. In this study, we developed an in vitro model by transforming nontumorigenic human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells through long-term exposure to Cr (VI). By utilizing this model, we found that miR-143 expression levels were dramatically repressed in Cr (VI)-transformed cells. The repression of miR-143 led to Cr (VI)-induced cell malignant transformation and angiogenesis via upregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) expression. Moreover, we found that interleukin-8 is the major upregulated angiogenesis factor induced by Cr (VI) through activation of IGF-IR/IRS1 axis followed by activation of downstream ERK/hypoxia-induced factor-1a/NF-?B signaling pathway. These findings establish a causal role and mechanism of miR-143 in regulating Cr (VI)- induced malignant transformation and tumor angiogenesis. © The Author 2013.

84884812813	MicroRNA-26a promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis in glioma by directly targeting prohibitin	Summary: Backgrounds and Aims: Glioma accounts for the majority of primary malignant brain tumors in adults. Upregulation of microRNA-26a (miR-26a) has been observed in glioma. However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of miR-26a in glioma remain to be elucidated. Methods: Glioma cells stably overexpressing or down-expressing miR-26a were analyzed for both in vitro and in vivo biological functions. Novel target of miR-26a was identified by bioinformatics searching and molecular biological assays. Glioma specimens and normal brain tissues were analyzed for both expression levels of miR-26a and its target. Results: Forced expression of miR-26a in glioma cells significantly increased both growth rate and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo, while reduced expression of miR-26a played opposite roles. MiR-26a directly targeted prohibitin (PHB) whose expression levels were downregulated in glioma specimens. The levels of miR-26a were inversely correlated with PHB expression levels in glioma samples and strongly correlated with clinical WHO grades of glioma. Conclusion: These results reveal that miR-26a regulates PHB and promotes glioma progression both in vitro and in vivo and that miR-26a and its target PHB are associated with glioma development, which can be helpful in developing microRNA-based treatment for glioma in the future. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This herb material, containing plenty of phthalide compositions, is selected as the analytical target in this paper for its hematological activity. Some of the phthalides are not stable and are difficult to analyze by gas chromatography-MS. Under optimized LC-MS-MS conditions, six phthalides in the methanol extract of Chuanxiong are unambiguously identified, and characteristic fragments are obtained using homemade reference standards. Ten other phthalides in the extract are confirmed by means of LC-APCI-MS with positive-negative ion mode and collision-induced dissociation in combination with UV spectrophotometry. The results show that LC-MS-MS is a method of choice for fast detection and detailed structural analysis of such mixtures in the crude extract of Chuanxiong.

Methods: The non-cytotoxic concentration of docetaxel and the activity of gelatinase were determined with MTT and gelatin zymography respectively, the expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) 2 and MMP 9 was investigated with RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: The maximum non-cytotoxic concentration of docetaxel on LS174T Cells was 1.0 ng/ml. Compared with the solvent control group, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 ng/ml of docetaxel could downregulate the expression of VEGF, bFGF, MMP 2 and MMP 9 and suppress the activity of gelatinase. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the non-cytotoxic concentrations of docetaxel have strong antiangiogenic activity on LS174T Cells, which suggests docetaxel may be a promising antiangiogenic agent.

84888420806	Antioxidant effect of mogrosides against oxidative stress induced by palmitic acid in mouse insulinoma NIT-1 cells	Excessive oxidative stress in pancreatic β cells, caused by glucose and fatty acids, is associated with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Mogrosides have shown antioxidant and antidiabetic activities in animal models of diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluated the antioxidant effect of mogrosides on insulinoma cells under oxidative stress caused by palmitic acid, and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mouse insulinoma NIT-1 cells were cultured in medium containing 0.75 mM palmitic acid, mimicking oxidative stress. The effects of 1 mM mogrosides were determined with the dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay for intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and FITC-Annexin V/PI assay for cell apoptosis. Expression of glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2) and pyruvate kinase was determined by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Palmitic acid significantly increased intracellular ROS concentration 2-fold (P<0.05), and decreased expression of GLUT2 (by 60%, P<0.05) and pyruvate kinase (by 80%, P<0.05) mRNAs in NIT-1 cells. Compared with palmitic acid, co-treatment with 1 mM mogrosides for 48 h significantly reduced intracellular ROS concentration and restored mRNA expression levels of GLUT2 and pyruvate kinase. However, mogrosides did not reverse palmitic acid-induced apoptosis in NIT-1 cells. Our results indicate that mogrosides might exert their antioxidant effect by reducing intracellular ROS and regulating expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism. Further research is needed to achieve a better understanding of the signaling pathway involved in the antioxidant effect of mogrosides.

84893319290	The association of UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 with irinotecan-induced neutropenia in Asians: A meta-analysis	Background: The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is known as a biomarker of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in Caucasians. However, in Asians, the UGT1A1*28 mutation is much less frequent. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association of the UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 with neutropenia in Asians. Results: In a combination test of the two variations, patients with severe neutropenia displayed a 155% higher mutational load than those that were not neutropenic (ORG=2.55; 95% CI: 1.82-3.58). Conclusions: In Asians, a combination test of UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 might be a potential biomarker of irinotecan-induced neutropenia, an observation that will need additional trials for confirmation. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

84895128766	Chronic arsenic exposure and angiogenesis in human bronchial epithelial Cells via the ROS/miR-199a-5p/HIF-1α/COX-2 pathway	Background: Environmental and occupational exposure to arsenic is a major public health concern. Although it has been identified as a human carcinogen, the molecular mechanism underlying the arsenic-induced carcinogenesis is not well understood. Objectives: We aimed to determine the role and mechanisms of miRNAs in arsenic-induced tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. Methods: We utilized an in vitro model in which human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells were transformed through long-term exposure to arsenic. A human xenograft tumor model was established to assess tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Tube formation assay and chorioallantoic membranes assay were used to assess tumor angiogenesis. Results: We found that miR-199a-5p expression levels were more than 100-fold lower in arsenictransformed cells than parental cells. Re-expression of miR-199a-5p impaired arsenic-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth through its direct targets HIF-1α and COX-2. We further showed that arsenic induced COX-2 expression through HIF-1 regulation at the transcriptional level. In addition, we demonstrated that reactive oxygen species are an upstream event of miR-199a-5p/ HIF-1α/COX-2 pathway in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Conclusion: The findings establish critical roles of miR-199a-5p and its downstream targets HIF-1/COX-2 in arsenic-induced tumor growth and angiogenesis.

84899714247	Blood α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol levels and risk of prostate cancer: A meta-analysis of prospective studies	Background: Epidemiological studies that have examined the association of blood α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol (the principal bioactive form of vitamin E) levels with the risk of prostate cancer have yielded inconsistent results. In addition, a quantitative assessment of published studies is not available. Methods and Findings: In this meta-analysis, relevant studies were sought by a search of the PubMed and Embase databases for articles published up to October 2013, with no restrictions. Bibliographies from retrieved articles also were scoured to find further eligible studies. Prospective studies that reported adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between blood tocopherol levels and the risk of prostate cancer were included. Nine nested case-control studies involving approximately 370,000 participants from several countries were eligible. The pooled RRs of prostate cancer for the highest versus lowest category of blood α-tocopherol levels were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68-0.91), and those for γ-tocopherol levels were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71-1.12), respectively. Significant heterogeneity was present among the studies in terms of blood γ-tocopherol levels (p = 0.008) but not in terms of blood α-tocopherol levels (p = 0.33). The risk of prostate cancer decreased by 21% for every 25-mg/L increase in blood α-tocopherol levels (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69-0.91). Conclusions: Blood α-tocopherol levels, but not γ-tocopherol levels, were inversely associated with the risk of prostate cancer in this meta-analysis. © 2014 Cui et al.

84900472812	Prognostic role of C-reactive protein in prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Several studies have reported that C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation biomarker, may be associated with the prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa). The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the predictive role of CRP for survival in PCa as reported in previous studies. Related studies were identified, and evaluated for quality through multiple search strategies. Data was collected from studies comparing overall and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with elevated CRP levels and those having lower levels. However, for progression-free survival (PFS), data were collected according to the log of CRP. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the strength of associations. A total of nine studies (n = 1,497) were evaluated in this meta-analysis (five for overall survival (OS), four for CSS and two for PFS). For OS and PFS, the pooled HR of CRP was statistically significant at 1.51 (95% CI, 1.28-1.79) and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.25-1.81), respectively. For CSS, the pooled HR was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.36-2.69) with higher CRP expression in PCa, which strongly indicates poorer survival in PCa. This study demonstrates that CRP may have a critical prognostic value in patients with prostatic cancer. © 2014 AJA, SIMM & SJTU.

84899856003	A novel complex A/C/G intergenotypic recombinant of hepatitis B virus isolated in Southern China	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and subgenotypes may vary in geographical distribution and virological features. Previous investigations, including ours, showed that HBV genotypes B and C were respectively predominant in South and North China, while genotypes A and D were infrequently detected and genotype G was not found. In this study, a novel A/C/G intergenotype was identified in patients with chronic HBV infection in Guilin, a city in southern China. Initial phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene suggested the HBV recombinant to be genotype G. However, extended genotyping based on the entire HBV genome indicated it to be an A/C/G intergenotype with a closer relation to genotype C. Breakpoint analysis using the SIMPLOT program revealed that the recombinant had a recombination with a arrangement of genotypes A, G, A and C fragments. Compared with the HBV recombinants harboring one or two genotype G fragments found in Asian countries, this Guilin recombinant was highly similar to the Vietnam (98-99%) and Long An recombinants (96-99%), but had a relatively low similarity to the Thailand one (89%). Unlike those with the typical genotype G of HBV, the patients with the Guilin recombinant were seropositive for HBeAg. Moreover, a relatively high HBV DNA viral load (> 2x10

Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of literature evaluating human equilibrative nucleoside transporter1 expression as a prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and to conduct a subsequent meta-analysis to quantify the overall prognostic effect. Methods: Related studies were identified and evaluated for quality through multiple search strategies. Only studies analyzing pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy were eligible for inclusion. Data were collected from studies comparing overall, disease-free and progression-free survival (OS, DFS and PFS) in patients with low human equilibrative nucleoside transporter1 levels and those having high levels. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were used to assess the strength of associations. Hazard ratios greater than 1 reflect adverse survival associated with low human equilibrative nucleoside transporter1 levels. Results: A total of 12 studies (n = 875) were involved in this meta-analysis (12 for OS, 5 for DFS, 3 for PFS). For overall and disease-free survival, the pooled HRs of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter1 were significant at 2.93 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.37-3.64) and 2.67 (95% CI, 1.87-3.81), respectively. For progression-free survival, the pooled HR in higher human equilibrative nucleoside transporter1 expression in pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy was 2.76 (95% CI, 1.76-4.34). No evidence of significant heterogeneity or publication bias was seen in any of these studies. Conclusion: These results support the case for a low human equilibrative nucleoside transporter1 level representing a significant and reproducible marker of adverse prognosis in pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. © 2014 Liu et al.

84901792506	MicroRNA-mRNA functional pairs for cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells	Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Cisplatin is the core of first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Many patients eventually become resistant to cisplatin, diminishing its therapeutic effect. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical functions in diverse biological processes. Using miRNA profiling and polymerase chain reaction validation, we identified a panel of differentially expressed miRNAs and their potential targets in cisplatin-resistant SKOV3/DDP ovarian cancer cells relative to cisplatin-sensitive SKOV3 parental cells. More specifically, our results revealed significant changes in the expression of 13 of 663 miRNAs analyzed, including 11 that were up-regulated and 2 that were down-regulated in SKOV3/DDP cells with or without cisplatin treatment compared with SKOV3 cells with or without cisplatin treatment. miRNA array and mRNA array data were further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the genes ANKRD17, SMC1A, SUMO1, GTF2H1, and TP73, which are involved in DNA damage signaling pathways, are potential targets of miRNAs in promoting cisplatin resistance. This study highlights candidate miRNAmRNA interactions that may contribute to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.

84904305583	Heat shock protein 22 overexpression is associated with the progression and prognosis in gastric cancer	Purpose: The heat shock protein 22 (HSP22) is associated with tumor proliferation and protects tumor cell from apoptosis in many malignancies. However, the role of HSP22 in gastric cancer has not been thoroughly elucidated. The aim was to determine the relationship of HSP22 expression with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in gastric cancer and estimate the alteration of HSP22 expression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: HSP22 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) antigen expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 129 gastric carcinoma samples. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between HSP22 expression and prognosis. The response of HSP22 was assessed in 47 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Results: HSP22 protein expression was significantly associated with tumor size, depth invasion, lymph node metastasis and stage of disease (all P < 0.05). In univariate and multivariate analyses, HSP22 was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.003 and P = 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, HSP22 overexpression was associated with a poor prognosis in all patients and in patients subgroups stratified by tumor size, depth invasion and lymph node metastasis. In addition, HSP22 was significantly correlated with MMP-9 among 129 gastric cancer tissues (P < 0.001). Patients who had MMP-9 overexpression had poor OS and shorter RFS. Moreover, the alteration of HSP22 was not comparable in 47 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: HSP22 plays an important role on tumor aggressiveness and prognosis and may act as a promising target for prognostic prediction. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84905456628	Variation in Sp1 binding sites correlates with expression of survivin in breast cancer	Survivin is the smallest member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family and is deregulated in breast cancer, where it is associated with a poor overall prognosis. It is well established that survivin overexpression predominately occurs at the transcriptional level. Numerous transcription factors bind to specific sequences in the promoter regions of genes and are involved in transcriptional regulation. Specificity protein (Sp) 1 binding sites have been found in the promoter region of the survivin gene. The present study aimed to investigate whether variations in Sp1 binding sites affect survivin expression. Nested polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing were performed to analyze the survivin gene promoter region in 42 breast cancer tissue samples. Furthermore, survivin expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. High survivin protein expression was found in 66.7% (28/42) of breast cancer tissue samples. In addition, 15 variations in seven Sp1 binding sites were detected in 12 samples and Sp1 binding site variation was found to be associated with low survivin expression in the 42 samples. These findings suggested that variations in Sp1 binding sites may be associated with survivin expression.

84906253175	Computed tomography manifestations of histologic subtypes of retroperitoneal liposarcoma	Objective: Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma and accounts for approximately 20% of all mesenchymal malignancies, often occurring in deep soft tissue of retroperitoneal space. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is therefore necessary. We explored whether computed tomography (CT) could be used to differentiate between the various types of retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLS). Method: Forty-seven cases of RPLS, diagnosed surgically and histologically, were analyzed retrospectively. CT features were correlated with postoperative pathological appearance. Results: The study radiologist identified 29, 11, 2, 2 and 3 RPLS as atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDL), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL), myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (ML/RCL), pleomorphic liposarcoma (PL) and mixed-type liposarcoma. Analysis of CT scans revealed the following typical findings of the different subtypes of RPLS: ALT/WDL was mainly visible as a well-delineated fatty hypodense tumor with uniform density and integrity margin; DDL was marked by the combination of focal nodular density and hypervascularity. ML/RCL, PL and mixed liposarcoma showed malignant biological behaviour and CT findings need further studies. Conclusions: CT scanning can reveal important details including internal components, margins and surrounding tissues. Based on CT findings, tumor type can be roughly evaluated and biopsy location and therapeutic scheme guided.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the dynamic variation of plasma D-dimer and its relationship with other markers of the coagulation system including platelet counts, fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and thrombin time (TT) in terminal stage cancer patients. We designed a self-controlled study to compare plasma D-dimer dynamic variation from 0-4 weeks to 4-8 weeks before patients’ death. The plasma D-dimer levels pointed an elevated tendency and revealed statistically significant difference as patients gradually near death. Prolonged PT, APTT and TT were found. D-dimer levels were positively correlated with PT, APTT and TT but showed negative correlation with platelet counts and fibrinogen levels. Plasma D-dimer levels gradually increased as terminal stage cancer patients approaching to death. Increasing D-dimer levels may predict worse outcome.

84907278953	ALDH1A1 overexpression is associated with the progression and prognosis in gastric cancer	Background: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) is a cancer stem cell marker, and its expression correlates with prognosis in a number of malignancies. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship of ALDH1A1 expression with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in gastric cancer.Methods: ALDH1A1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 216 gastric carcinoma samples. The association between expression of ALDH1A1 and MMP-9, clinicopathological parameters, and prognosis of gastric cancer was examined.Results: ALDH1A1 protein expression was significantly associated with depth invasion, lymph node metastasis and stage of disease (all P < 0.05). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that ALDH1A1 was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (both P < 0.001). Furthermore, ALDH1A1 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in patients subgroups stratified by tumor size, depth invasion and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, ALDH1A1 was significantly correlated with MMP-9 among 216 gastric cancer tissues (P < 0.001). Patients who had ALDH1A1 overexpression, in which tumor cells displayed high invasiveness, had poor OS and shorter RFS.Conclusion: ALDH1A1 plays an important role in tumor aggressiveness and prognosis, and may act as a promising target for prognostic prediction.

84908053632	Primary malignant melanoma of the cervix: A case report	Primary malignant melanoma (MM) of the uterine cervix is a rare neoplasm and the overall prognosis of patients with this disease is poor. Immunohistochemical methods and exclusion of other primary melanoma sites are used to confirm the diagnosis. In the present study, the case of a 65-year-old female patient with an MM of the uterine cervix is reported. Diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical methods using human melanoma black 45 antibody and S-100 protein. The tumor was identified as stage IB1 using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification. Chest X-ray and abdominopelvic computed tomography results were normal. The patient subsequently underwent a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Following combined radical surgery and chemotherapy, complete remission of the tumor was achieved. The patient has since been well for 30 months without recurrence subsequent to the surgery.

84920097833	Progress on the treatment of pancreatic andenocarcinoma by fixed dose-rate infusion of gemcitabine	OBJECTIVE: This paper is aimed to review the progress on the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma by gemcitabine administrated at fixed dose-rate (FDR) infusion and discuss the application of FDR gemcitabine (FDR-GEM). METHODS: Database of PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang and Chinese Biomedical database were searched using key words “gemcitabine, fixed dose-rate, pancreatic adenocarcinoma” from 01, 2000 to 12, 2011.Publishing time and languages were not limited. Pharmacological researches, clinical trials, reviews and meta-analyses of FDR-GEM were collected. A number of 253 searching records were screened, and 26 eligible articles were included. The inclusion criteria were: 1) clinical trails or meta-analyses comparing FDR infusion and standard infusion of gemcitabine; 2) studies about the pharmacology of FDR infusion of gemcitabine. RESULTS: Pharmacological researches had demonstrated that the accumulation of gemcitabine triphosphate could reach maximum velocity with FDR-GEM. Tempero's randomized controlled trial showed that FDR-GEM improved survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma but with more hematological toxicities compared to standard infusion. FDR-GEM also had satisfying survival when in combination with other agents in recent clinical trials and hematological toxicities were less frequently with a relatively low dose. CONCLUSION: FDR-GEM can improve patients' survival for patients of pancreatic adenocarcinoma but with higher incidence of hematological toxicities.

0346639398	Primary Study on Degradation Mechanism of Polystyrenesulfonic Acid Membrane and Its Composite Membrane in Fuel Cells	The lifetime behavior of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) fabricated with polystyenesulfonic acid (PSSA) membrane was investigated in order to present the degradation mechanism of the PSSA membrane. The water evacuated from the anode and the cathode of the cell during the lifetime experiment was analyzed by the method of high-performance liquid chromatogram. The distribution of S concentration in the cross-section of the PSSA membrane was measured by energy dispersive spectrograph. Infrared spectroscopic measurements were carried out to investigate the structure of the PSSA membrane before and after the fuel cell experiment. The degradation mechanism of the PSSA membrane is indicated as that : during the fuel cell operation, the reduction of O

0842310498	Direct characterization of bitter acids in a crude hop extract by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry	The applicability of on-line coupling of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry for the separation and characterization of hop acids mixture from the crude extract of Humulus lupulus was investigated. The solvent system consisting of acetonitrile-aqueous formic acid was used to give proper separation of the six main hop bitter acids within 30 min. Further structural information about the components was acquired by collision-induced dissociation (CID). On the basis of analyses of the fragmentation patterns of the major α- and β-bitter acids respectively, identification of the minor ones was performed using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with a group of qualitatively relevant selected precursor-product ion transitions for each bitter acid in a single high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) run. Using this technique, six minor hop acids, including "adprelupulone" observed for the first time in natural resources, were detected along with the six major acids. This hyphenated techniques provides potency for rapid qualitative determination of analogs and homologs in mixtures. © 2004 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.

12244265475	Variations of elemental distribution in brain regions of neonatal rats at different iodine intakes	Iodine deficiency (ID) can result in irreversible damage to the brain during the fetal and neonatal stages. As the active center of many enzymes, trace elements play essential roles in brain function. In this work, the relative contents and distributions of elements (Cl, Br, Fe, Cu, and Zn) in two important brain regions, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, of the iodine-deficient model rats were determined by the synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) method. Meanwhile, the ID rats were supplemented with adequate and excessive iodine, respectively. The results indicated that the distributions of trace elements could be influenced by the different iodine intakes in the stage of brain development. In contrast to the control group, the contents of Cl, Br, and Zn in two brain regions showed a significant increase in the ID group; however, both Fe and Cu decreased in the cerebral cortex and increased in the hippocmapus in the ID group. In addition, only slight changes of elemental contents in brain were found between the adequate and excessive iodine-supplemented rats.

84925229534	More favorable response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in women than in men	Background: Data on sex difference in response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) remain controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize all published studies to determine whether sex-based differences in response to CRT exist. Methods and Results: We performed a literature search using MEDLINE (source PubMed; January 1966 to March 2014) and EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2014) with no restrictions. Pooled effect estimates were obtained by using randomeffects meta-analysis. Seventy-two studies involving 33 434 patients were identified. Overall, female patients had better outcomes from CRT compared with male patients, with a significant 33% reduction in the risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.74; P<0.001), 20% reduction in death or hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.90; P<0.001), 41% reduction in cardiac death (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.84; P<0.001), and 41% reduction in ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.70; P<0.001). These more favorable responses to CRT in women were consistently associated with greater echocardiographic evidence of reverse cardiac remodeling in women than in men. Conclusions: Women obtained greater reductions in the risk of death from any cause, cardiac cause, death or hospitalization for heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death with CRT therapy compared with men, with consistently greater echocardiographic evidence of reverse cardiac remodeling in women than in men. Further studies are needed to investigate the exact reasons for these results and determine whether indications for CRT in women should be different from men.
