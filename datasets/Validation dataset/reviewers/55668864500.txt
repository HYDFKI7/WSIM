84939883942	Assessment of Transfection of AdCMV-EGFP to Rat Submandibular Gland Cells	We evaluated the efficiency of transfecting adenoviral vectors encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (AdCMV-EGFP) into rat submandibular gland cells and the effects of gene transfer on cell proliferation and secretory function. Isolated submandibular gland cells were transfected with different titers (or multiplicity of infection, MOI) of AdCMV-EGFP. The transfection efficiency was evaluated by quantifying EGFP-positive cells by inverted fluorescence microscopy, cell proliferation by MTT assay, and cell secretory activity by measuring α-amylase in culture medium. A transfection efficiency of up to 70.8 % was achieved in submandibular gland cells. MTT assay showed that increased viral titers resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, which occurs on day 5 post-transfection. Simultaneously, the amylase levels started to reduce with a significant decrease on day 7 after transfection. The results show that AdCMV-EGFP transfection of submandibular gland cells at higher MOI results in cytotoxicity, decreased cell proliferation, and secretory function. However, the lower adenoviral titers (e.g., 200 particles/cell) could be an efficient and safe labeling tool for gene transfer to submandibular gland cells.

0007787694	Role and pitfalls of hepatic helical multi-phase CT scanning in differential diagnosis of small hemangioma and small hepatocellular carcinoma	AIM: To compare and analyze the contrast enhancement appearance of small hemangioma (SHHE) and small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC) with helical multi-phase CT scanning so as to determine their roles and pitfalls in the differential diagnosis of SHHE and SHCC. METHODS: The pre and postcontrast CT scanning of the liver in 73 cases (38 SHHE, 35 SHCC) were carried out. The first phase scan of the entire liver began at 30s after the injection of contrast medium, the second and third phases began at 70s, and 4min respectively. The contrast enhancement patterns and characteristics of all lesions were observed and compared. RESULTS: In SHHE, 64.29% (27/ 42) had typical manifestations in two-phase dynamic scanning, such as peripheral dramatic high-density enhancement of the lesions with progressive opacification from the periphery toward the center, 30.95% (13/ 42) were hyperdense in both phases and 4.76% (2/ 42) were hypodense in both phases. In the third phase scanning, 96.67% (28/ 30) of SHHE were hyperdense and isodense. In SHCC 59.52% (25/ 42) presented typical appearances, such as hyperdense in the first phase and hypodense in the second phase, 23.81% (10/ 42) were hyperdense in the first phase and isodense in the second phase with 4.76% (2/ 42) of hypodense in both phases. In the third phase scanning, 85.71% (24/ 28) of SHCC were hypodense. CONCLUSION: According to the contrast enhancement patterns of SHHE and SHCC in the two-phase or multi-phase scanning by helical CT, diagnosis can be established in the majority of lesions, while some atypical cases needed MRI for further investigation.

2442551618	Culture of canine periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro and their biological characteristics	Aim: To establish a simple and reliable approach to primary isolation and culture of periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) so as to investigate the feasibility of PDLFs as the seed cells for periodontal tissue engineering. Methods: With the improved tissue block culture, the periodontal ligament tissues clung to the middle third of the root surface of the totally anesthetized canine incisor teeth were gently curetted, removed, cut into small pieces, and plated onto 6-well plate with cover slip in place of the dry anchoring traditionally. After the successfully cultured cells were subcultured, methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium(MTT) colorimetric assay, immunohistochemical staining and Von Kossa staining were used to determine their biological characteristics. Results: The success rate of primary culture of canine PDLFs was up to about 89%. The PDLFs identified with immunohistochemical staining were positive for vimentin and negative for keratin, and produced mineral-like nodules in vitro. Conclusion: A simple and stable method to obtain primary PDLFs is established by means of improved tissue block culture. PDLFs cultured in vitro have partial phenotype of osteoblast-like cells, indicating that they can be used as seed cells for periodontal tissue engineering.

2442642815	Multiphase hepatic scans with multirow-detector helical CT in detection of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Multirow-detector helical CT (MDCT) allows faster Z-axis coverage and improves longitudinal resolution to scan the entire liver. This study was to evaluate the value of multiphase hepatic CT scans using MDCT in diagnosing hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Multiphase hepatic CT scans in 40 patients were carried out with a Marconi Mx8000 MDCT scanner. The scans of early arterial phase (EAP), late arterial phase (LAP) and portal venous phase (PVP) were started at 21, 34 and 85 seconds after injection of contrast medium, respectively. The number of detected lesions was calculated in each phase. The density of the liver and tumor was greater than 1 cm for HCC, and the density of the liver and tumor in each phase was statistically calculated. Results: A total of 61 lesions were found in the 40 patients, and lesions greater than 1 cm were seen in 47 cases. The density differences between the liver and tumor were statistically significant (P <0. 05) at the LAP and EAP and between the LAP, EAP and PVP. In the 61 lesions, the detectability in the EAP, LAP and the double arterial phases (DAP) was 32%, 87%, and 94%, respectively. Significant difference was found between the LAP plus PVP and the EAP plus PVP; but no significant difference was observed between the DAP plus PVP and the LAP plus PVP. Conclusions: The utility of MDCT scan in the liver has optimized the protocol of arterial phase scan. MDCT is possible to scan the entire liver in a real arterial phase and it is very valuable in the detection of small HCC. © 2004, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

2442526219	Experimental observation of relationship between indwelling time of the barrier membranes and periodontal tissue regeneration after guided tissue regeneration treatment	Aim: To observe the periodontal tissue response to guided tissue regeneration(GTR) in different period in order to explore an appropriate indwelling time of the barrier membranes after GTR. Methods: Six mongrels' grade II chronic furcation involvement was established, which had been created in all second, third and fourth premolar teeth of mandibular area. One side of the jaws were treated by GTR, and the other side were treated by flap operation therapy. The animals were sacrificed at 4, 6 and 8 weeks after operation, and routine histologic processing was performed. Results: Comparing the two different treatments, there were more periodontal regenerative tissues in the GTR treatment groups than flap operation therapy group. Furthermore, in the GTR treatment group, the parameters of periodontal regeneration tissue in 6 weeks were significantly more than those at 4 weeks, while had no significant differences between 6 and 8 weeks. Conclusion: It spends at least 6 weeks in maintaining the barrier membranes staying in the furcation place in order to gain the most regeneration tissue, when GTP is used for the treatment of grade II chronic furcation involvement.

33744781807	Whole-body MR angiography with 32-receiving channels and parallel imaging techniques: A preliminary clinical study	Objective: To preliminarily evaluate a novel whole-body 3D contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiography (MRA) technique in the demonstration of various systemic arterial diseases. Methods: Thirty patients underwent whole-body 3D CE MRA using a 1.5 T MR imager (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens AG) equipped with 32 receiving channels and integrated parallel acquisition techniques (iPAT). The patients included were with clinically documented peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD, n = 17), Takayasu arteritis (n = 3), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 1), Type B dissection (n = 4), and thoracic and/or abdominal aneurysm (n = 5). 68 surface coil elements were employed to encompass the whole body. Four 3D CE MRA stations with each field-of-view of 50 cm were acquired successively through automatic table moving. The gadolinium contrast medium dose was 0.3 mmol/kg and a biphasic injection was employed with 0.15 mmol/kg injected at a rate of 1.3 ml/s and another 0.15 mmol/kg at a rate of 0.6 ml/s. A total scan range of 188 cm, covering the arterial tree from carotid artery to trifurcation vessels, was acquired. Overall image quality of each arterial segment was assessed. The depiction of various systemic arterial diseases was evaluated and compared to other available imaging modalities including X-ray angiography in nine patients, CT angiography in eight patients, and mono-station MRA in one patient. Results: Whole- body 3D CE MRA was well tolerated by all patients. It yielded a detailed display of the arterial system with an average room time of 17.4 min. In seven of 17 patients with PAOD, whole-body MRA showed additional vascular narrowing apart from peripheral arterial-disease. In four patients with vasculitis, whole-body MRA depicted luminal irregularity, narrowing or occlusion, aneurysm, and collateral circulation involving multiple vascular segments. Whole-body MRA also clearly revealed the severity and extent of dissection and aortic aneurysm. In cases with other available imaging techniques, the demonstration of vascular pathology all agreed except one case of overestimation of stenosis by whole body MRA. Conclusion: Our results showed this 32-receiving-channel MR system with surface coil technology allowed a quick and easy-to-perform whole-body MRA. It was very valuable for a comprehensive evaluation of vascular involvement of various systemic arterial diseases.

33847064995	Utilizing generalized autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) to achieve high-resolution contrast-enhanced MR angiography of hepatic artery: Initial experience in orthotopic liver transplantation candidates	Objective: To evaluate feasibility of using GRAPPA to acquire high-resolution 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) of hepatic artery and value of GRAPPA for displaying vessels anatomy. Materials and methods: High-resolution CE-MRA using GRAPPA was performed in 67 orthotopic liver transplantation recipient candidates. Signal intensity (SI) and relative SI, i.e., Cv-ro (vessel-to-liver contrast) of the aorta and the hepatic common artery (HCA), were measured. The SI and the relative SI were compared and analyzed using T-test. For purpose of qualitative evaluation, the vessel visualization quality and the order of depicted hepatic artery branches were evaluated by two radiologists independently and assessed by weighted kappa analysis. The depiction of hepatic arterial anatomy and variations was evaluated, and results were correlated with the findings in surgery. Results: The mean SI values were 283.29 ± 65.07 (mean ± S.D.) for aorta and 283.16 ± 64.07 for HCA, respectively. The mean relative SI values were 0.698 ± 0.09 for aorta and 0.696 ± 0.09 for HCA, respectively. Homogeneous enhancement between aorta and HCA was confirmed by statistically insignificant differences (p-values were 0.89 for mean SI values and 0.12 for mean relative SI values, respectively). The average score for vessel visualization ranged from good to excellent for different artery segments. Overall interobserver agreement in the visualization of different artery segments was excellent (kappa value > 0.80). The distal intrahepatic segmental arteries were well delineated for majority of patients with excellent interobserver agreement. Normal hepatic arterial anatomy was correctly demonstrated in 53 patients, and arterial anomalies were accurately detected on high-resolution MRA image of all 14 patients. Conclusion: High-resolution hepatic artery MRA acquired using GRAPPA in a reproducible manner excellently depicts and delineates small vessels and can be routinely used for evaluating OLT candidates. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

35949002855	The value of high-resolution contrast-enhanced three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography in the evaluation of hepatic arterial anatomy	Objective: Compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), to evaluate the value of high-resolution contrast-enhanced three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography (3D MRA) in defining hepatic arterial anatomy. Methods: The data about abdominal high-resolution contrast-enhanced 3D MRA and DSA of 26 patients (24 patients with primary liver cancer, 2 patients with metastatic liver tumor) was retrospectively analyzed. The display quality of different segmental hepatic artery was scored with 4 grades and the agreement between high-resolution 3D MRA and DSA was determined with the weighted Kappa statistic. The depiction of hepatic arterial anatomy/anomalies and vascular pathology on high-resolution 3D MRA was assessed and compared with DSA. Results: With respect to display quality, there was good or fair correlation between high-resolution 3D MRA and DSA for the common hepatic artery (the mean score respectively was 3.96, 3.96 and Kappa value 0.99), gastroduodenal artery (the mean score respectively 3.85, 3.88 and Kappa value 0.85), right hepatic artery (the mean score respectively 3.92, 3.96 and Kappa value 0.65), left hepatic artery (the mean score respectively 3.77, 3.92 and Kappa value 0.43), left gastric artery (the mean score respectively 3.73, 3.85 and Kappa value 0.43), right anterior artery (the mean score respectively 3.35, 3.70 and Kappa value 0.53), right posterior artery (the mean score respectively 3.31, 3.73 and Kappa value 0.46) and IV segment artery (the mean score respectively 2.92, 3.46 and Kappa value 0.51); Poor correlation was found for the II segment artery (the mean score respectively 2.15, 3.35 and Kappa value 0.18) and III segment artery (the mean score respectively 2.19, 3.35 and Kappa value 0.21). Compared with DSA, 18 normal hepatic arterial anatomy and 7 arterial anomalies were accurately demonstrated (accuracy ratio 96.1% (25/26)), the obliteration of gastroduodenal artery correctly depicted in 1 patient on high-resolution 3D MRA image. Conclusions: High-resolution 3D MRA can provide accurate evaluation of hepatic artery and has the capacity of depicting hepatic segment artery.

31644436269	Biological characteristics of canine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in vitro under non-inducing conditions	Background: Research on seed cells is the most important aspect in the filed of tissue-engineering research, and because of their various advantages, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been taken as the ideal bone tissue-engineering seed cells. Objective: To observes the growth characteristics of in vitro cultured BMSCs and their osteogenetic characteristics under non-inducing conditions. Design: A single sample experiment. Setting: Implanting Center of Stomatological Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Materials: This experiment was conducted at the Central Laboratory of Stomatological Hospital of Fujian Medical University, between May and December 2003. BMSCs are derived from the primary passage to the 3rd passage of in vitro cultured cells from 4 one-year old dogs. Methods: Under the aseptic conditions, bone marrow puncture was made at bilateral femur trochanter and 5 mL of heparin anticoagulated bone marrow was obtained. Then it was placed in 50 mL of anti-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium in centrifuge tube for monocyte isolation. The BMSCs single cells were primarily isolated and placed in culture box for subculture. After 48 hours, culture medium was removed and the medium was changed once every 3 days. Then subculture was carried on continuously to observe BMSCs in morphology under inverted the phase contrast microscope with the assistance of HE staining. The number of cells was counted daily to calculate doubling time and to draw a growth curve. Alkaline phosphatase was detected by using calcium-cobalt method, and chinalizarin staining was used to detect the growth state of calcification tubercle. Main outcome measures: 1 Optical microscopic structure of dog BMSCs; 2 The growth curve of dog BMSCs; 3Observation of osteogenetic index- alkaline phosphatase and calcification tubercle. Results: 1 Morphological observation indicated that BMSCs were adherent to the walls, clonogenic and appearing fibroblastic phenotype, and they presented morphological changes without exposing to osteogenetic inducer. 2 The expression of Alkaline phosphatase in primary cells was stronger, and it was strong in the 1st passage cell, but weak in the 2nd and 3rd passage cells. 3Calcium deposition was observed, which was stronger in primary cells than in subcultured cells. Conclusion: 1BMSCs massively proliferated during in vitro culture, capable of differentiating into osteoblasts and considered as the optimal seed cells for bone tissue-engineering reconstruction. 2 BMSCs derived from the 3rd passage has osteogenic activity, but the osteogenic activity of the primary cultured cells was stronger than thatr of the subcultured cells.

79952360555	PHEX neutralizing agent inhibits dentin formation in mouse tooth germ	The mutation of phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome (PHEX) can lead to human X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets which displays hypo-mineralization in bone and dentin. To study its possible roles in teeth, PHEX antibody was injected into pregnant mice on E15 to explore its roles on the formation of enamel and dentin. Mallory trichrome staining results showed that arrangements of ameloblasts and odontoblasts were irregular after PHEX antibody treatment. Differentiation of odontoblasts and the formation of dentin were inhibited. Spatiotemporal distribution of PHEX protein was observed in various stages of tooth germ. Immunohistochemical results showed positive PHEX signals appeared in the inner enamel epithelium on E16 and became stronger on E18. Ameloblasts and odontoblasts showed much higher PHEX expression on P1 and P3. Expression of PHEX in odontoblasts decreased accordingly. However, enamel formation was only slightly affected. The findings proved that a decrease in PHEX expression could suppress dentin formation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84897075744	Pattern of cerebral hyperperfusion in Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment using voxel-based analysis of 3D arterial spin-labeling imaging: Initial experience	Purpose: A three-dimensional (3D) continuous pulse arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique was used to investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Materials and methods: Three groups were recruited for comparison, 24 AD patients, 17 MCI patients, and 21 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Three-dimensional ASL scans covering the entire brain were acquired with a 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner. Spatial processing was performed with statistical parametric mapping 8. A second-level one-way analysis of variance analysis (threshold at P<0.05) was performed on the preprocessed ASL data. An average whole-brain CBF for each subject was also included as group-level covariates for the perfusion data, to control for individual CBF variations. Results: Significantly increased CBF was detected in bilateral frontal lobes and right temporal subgyral regions in aMCI compared with controls. When comparing AD with aMCI, the major hyperperfusion regions were the right limbic lobe and basal ganglia regions, including the putamen, caudate, lentiform nucleus, and thalamus, and hypoperfusion was found in the left medial frontal lobe, parietal cortex, the right middle temporo-occipital lobe, and particularly, the left anterior cingulate gyrus. We also found decreased CBF in the bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital cortices and left limbic lobe in AD patients, relative to the control group. aMCI subjects showed decreased blood flow in the left occipital lobe, bilateral inferior temporal cortex, and right middle temporal cortex. Conclusion: Our results indicated that ASL provided useful perfusion information in AD disease and may be used as an appealing alternative for further pathologic and neuropsychological studies, especially of compensatory mechanisms for cerebral hypoperfusion. © 2014 Ding et al.

84908469413	Differential diagnosis of pancreatic serous oligocystic adenoma and mucinous cystic neoplasm with spectral CT imaging: Initial results	Aim: To investigate the imaging characteristics of pancreatic serous oligocystic adenoma (SOA) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) using spectral computed tomography (CT) and to evaluate whether quantitative information derived from spectral imaging can improve the differential diagnosis of these diseases. Materials and methods: From February 2010 to June 2013, 44 patients (24 SOAs and 20 MCNs) who underwent spectral CT imaging were included in the study. Conventional characteristics and quantitative parameters were compared between the two disease groups. Logistic regression was used for multiparametric analysis. The receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of single parameter and multiparametric analysis. Two radiologists diagnosed the diseases blinded and independently, without and with the information of the statistical analysis. Results: Tumour location, contour, size, and monochromatic CT values at 40 keV to 70 keV, iodine concentration, and effective atomic number (effective-Z) in the late arterial phase were the independent factors correlated with category. Multiparametric analysis with logistic regression showed that tumour size, location, and contour were the most effective variations, and obtained an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.934. With the knowledge of statistical analysis, the accuracy of the first reader increased from 70.5% to 86.4%, and the accuracy of the second reader increased from 81.8% to 90.9%. Conclusions: Although CT spectral imaging provided additional information and multiparametric analysis obtained better performance than single-parameter analysis in differentiating MCNs from SOAs, multiparametric analysis with the combination of quantitative parameters derived from CT spectral imaging did not improve the diagnostic performance. Tumour size, location, and contour played an important role in differentiating MCNs from SOAs.

56649089674	Local inflammation exacerbates cyclosporine A-induced gingival overgrowth in rats	Gingival overgrowth (GO) is a common side effect of long-term cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. The risk factors appraised include drug interactions with calcium channel blockers, age, cyclosporine dose, dental bacterial plaque, duration of treatment, and genetic predisposition. The relationship and mechanism between GO and local inflammation caused by dental bacterial plaque have not been clearly defined. This research was carried out to investigate the histomorphometrical alterations and serum levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) in CsA-induced GO with or without local inflammation. Thirty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: Group I (control); Group II (ligation); Group III (CsA); Group IV (ligation and CsA). After 9 weeks the rats were sacrificed. The morphological examination was made and the histological changes with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining were observed. TGF-β1 levels in serum were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We report here that obvious GO are found in Group III and Group IV after CsA treatment, especially those rats with existed gingivitis presented an aggravation of GO. TGF-β1 levels in CsA-exposed groups were significantly higher than untreated groups, but ligation did not affect TGF-β1 level. These findings suggest that CsA-induced GO can be exacerbated by local inflammation. TGF-β1 may be a key factor for the development of GO. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

58449130151	Effects of Simvastatin on bone healing around titanium implants in osteoporotic rats	Objectives: Osteoporosis is known to impair the process of implant osseointegration. The recent discovery that statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) act as bone anabolic agents suggests that statins can be used as potential agents in the treatment of osteoporosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that statins will promote osteogenesis around titanium implants in subjects with osteoporosis. Material and methods: Fifty-four female Sprague Dawley rats, aged 3 months old, were randomly divided into three groups: Sham-operated group (SHAM; n=18), ovariectomized group (OVX; n=18), and ovariectomized with Simvastatin treatment group (OVX+SIM; n=18). Fifty-six days after being ovariectomized (OVX), screw-shaped titanium implants were inserted into the tibiae. Simvastatin was administered orally at 5 mg/kg each day after the placement of the implant in the OVX+SIM group. The animals were sacrificed at either 28 or 84 days after implantation and the undecalcified tissue sections were obtained. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area (BA) within the limits of implant threads were measured around the cortical (zone A) and cancellous (zone B) bone regions. Furthermore, bone density (BD) of zone B in a 500 μm wide zone lateral to the implants was also measured. Results: There were no significant differences in BIC and BA measurements in zone A in any of the three groups at either 28 or 84 days after implantation (P>0.05). By contrast, in zone B, significant differences in the measurement of BIC, BA, and BD were observed at 28 and 84 days between all three groups. Bone healing decreased with lower BIC, BA, and BD around implant in OVX group compared with other two groups, and Simvastatin reversed the negative effect of OVX on bone healing around implants with the improvement of BIC, BA, and BD in zone B. Conclusion: Osteoporosis can significantly influence bone healing in the cancellous bone around titanium implants and Simvastatin was shown to significantly improve the osseointegration of pure titanium implants in osteoporotic rats. © 2008 The Authors.

60849118972	Isolation and culture of gingival fibroblasts of beagle dogs in vitro	Background: The mild beagle dog with clear genetic background, which periodontal structure is similar to human, commonly serves as a large animal model for periodontological research. Objective: To isolate, culture and purify tho gingival fibroblasts of beagle dog-in vitro. Design, Time and Setting: The observation and comparison experiment was performed in the Central Laboratory of Affiliated Stomatological Hospital of Fujian Medical University and Department of Comparative Medicine in Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Area Command of Chinese PLA from September 2006 to February 2007. Materials: Five beagle dogs, male, aged 12 months, weighing 10-13 kg were used in this study. Methods: Free gingiva of Beagle dog was incised under basic anesthesia. Gingival fibroblasts were isolated, purified and amplified with half-digestion plus improved tissue block culture. Subsequently, the origination of tissue block was verified by operation and histology. Bone marrow stromal cells induced by osteogenesis, standard substance in the kit and distilled water were served as the positive control, standard and blank groups, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: Cells were identified by immunocytochemistry and detection of alkaline phosphatase (AKP). Methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay was used to investigate the proliferation of gingival fibroblasts. Results: The border of tissue block undigested was sharp, massive epithelial cells emigrated and presented cobblestone-like appearance. The digested tissue block digested was loose and surrounded by little epithelial cells. Fibroblast-like cells emigrated quickly. The immunocytochemical study revealed that vimentin staining was positive while keratin staining was negative. The results demostrated that incised tissue blocks were free gingiva. The fact that cells originated from mesoblast was verified by immunocytochemistry. The fibroblast-like cells hardly expressed byalkaline phosphatase, in addition, the proliferation of cells was in good condition.

67650559096	Immortalization of rat cranial neural crest stem cells induced by human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene transfection	BACKGROUND: Cranial neural crest stem cells were the main source of cranio-facial tissue and organ. It is essential to immortalize these cells. The frequency of spontaneous immortalization of human cells is low, but some immortalization genes can significantly increase this frequency. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in the immortalization of rat cranial neural crest stem cells. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The observational experiment was performed at the Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from September 2007 to June 2008. MATERIALS: Three embryonic 8.5 d rats (6 weeks, 180 g), and congenital cellular immune defects male Balb/c nude mice (18-21 g) were obtained from Experimental Animal Center of Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA. Plasmid PCIneo-hTERT was supplied by Department of Endodontics, Stomatology Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA. METHODS: Primary rat cranial crest stem cells were cultured and transfected with eurayotic expressing plasmid PCIneo-hTERT encoding hTERT gene. Positive clones were selected by G418 and expanded for continuous culture. Expression of hTERT and P75 were detected in stable clone by immunocytochemical method. Telomerase activity was also measured. Growth curves were depicted to show proliferation of clones. Nude mice with transfected cells were used observe the biology features of cell clones. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cell clone, specific protein P75 expression, telomerase activity, proliferation, tumorigensis test were measured. RESULTS: Following 24 hours PCIneo-hTERT transfection, a few cells died. After adding G418 for 48 hours, cells gradually died in a large number. At day 12, cell clone appeared, and about 3 cell clones grew well, which were named clones 1, 2 and 3. Following 20-25 passages, clones 1 and 2 died. However, clone 3 grew well in vitro, and stably expressed hTERT and P75. Following transfection, telomerase activity obviously increased, and continuously expressed. After hTERT transfection, the proliferation of three clones was strong in an early phase. Subsequently, the proliferation of clones 1 and 2 gradually became slow, and clones 1 and 2 died. Clone 3 passed the senescence phase, and with no oncogenicity. CONCLUSION: Rat cranial neural crest stem cells can be immortalized by hTERT transfection and can be used as seed cells in the further study of cranial-facial cell differentiation and tissue engineering.

67650658780	Effects of DMEM and RPMI 1640 on the biological behavior of dog periosteum-derived cells	Periosteum-derived cells (PDCs) are being extensively studied as potential tissue engineering seed cells and have demonstrated tremendous promise to date. There is convincing evidence that culture medium could modulate the biological behavior of cultured cells. In this study, we investigate the effects of DMEM (low glucose) and RPMI 1640 on cell growth and cell differentiation of PDCs in vitro. PDCs isolated from Beagle dogs were maintained in DMEM and RPMI 1640, respectively. Then, the cell migration rate of periosteum tissues was analyzed. PDCs of the third passage were harvested for the study of proliferation and osteogenic activity. Proliferation was detected by MTT assay. Alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodules were measured to investigate osteogenic differentiation. Our data demonstrated that DMEM induced alkaline phosphatase activity and strongly stimulated matrix mineralization in cell culture, while similar cell migration rates and proliferation behaviors were observed in the two culture conditions. Interestingly, the osteogenic differentiation of PDCs could be enhanced in DMEM compared with that in RPMI 1640. Thus, it can be ascertained that DMEM may serve as a suitable culture condition allowing osteogenic differentiation of dog PDCs. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

67651119945	Application of autologous cryopreserved bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for periodontal regeneration in dogs	Background: Stem cell-based therapies have shown great promise in regenerative medicine and continue to generate wide interest in future clinical applications. However, the issue of storage and preservation of stem cells, for future clinical applications, still requires extensive investigation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cryopreservation on the regenerative capacity of bone marrow stem cells in periodontal defects in dogs. Materi als and Methods: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were obtained from 5 beagle dogs. After cryopreservation for 1 month, cell viability, surface adherence ability, alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation were assessed. Twenty-six periodontal fenestration defects (5 × 5 mm) were created at a location 5 mm apical to the cemento-enamel junction in experimental teeth. Cryopreserved BMSCs were transplanted into the defects using a collagen scaffold carrier. Freshly isolated BMSCs and collagen scaffold alone were used as controls. All animals were sacrificed 8 weeks after surgery, and specimens were evaluated by histomorphometry. Results: Cryopreservation had no discernible negative effect on BMSC growth and differentiation in vitro. Both freshly isolated and cryopreserved BMSC transplantations induced significantly better periodontal regeneration with newly formed cementum, alveolar bone and periodontal ligament compared with the application of collagen scaffold alone. Conclusion: Cryopreserved BMSCs showed no altered regenerative capacity compared with freshly isolated BMSCs in the application of periodontal regeneration. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

70350066622	High-resolution 3D contrast-enhanced MRA with parallel imaging techniques before endovascular interventional treatment of arterial stenosis	This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of high-resolution 3D contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (3D CE MRA) with parallel imaging techniques for the diagnosis of various arterial stenoses and its value for planning endovascular interventional treatment. Thirty-five patients underwent 3D CE MRA before endovascular interventional treatment. Numbers of patients were as follows: clinically documented renal artery stenosis (n = 10), renal transplant artery stenosis (n = 1), carotid artery stenosis (n = 12), iliac artery stenosis (n = 11) and femoro-popliteal artery stenosis (n = 1). A total of 39 arterial segments were treated. The depiction of various arterial stenoses was evaluated. The degree and length of the stenoses were compared and analyzed between 3D CE MRA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The accuracy of MRA in depicting lesion characteristics (ulceration, eccentricity, post-stenotic dilatation) was reviewed. The overall value of 3D CE MRA in planning interventional treatment was determined. The quality of 3D CE MRA in the demonstration of various arterial stenoses was judged excellent or good. A strong correlation was noted between 3D CE MRA and DSA regarding severity and length of stenosis. The accuracy of 3D CE MRA in depicting lesion characteristics was good. 3D CE MRA overestimated three severe iliac artery stenoses. Except in these three segments, the value of 3D CE MRA analysis was judged high. 3D CE MRA was found to be better than DSA in revealing the distal reconstitution and occluded segment in cases of iliac artery stenosis. 3D CE MRA is accurate in demonstrating the relevant anatomy necessary to plan endovascular interventional treatment for patients with arterial stenosis. © The Author(s), 2009.

71749103065	Epithelioid angiomyolipoma of the liver: Cross-sectional imaging findings of 10 immunohistochemically-verified cases	AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging features of epithelioid angiomyolipoma of the liver (Epi-HAML), with pathology as a reference. METHODS: The CT/MRI findings (number, diameter, lobar location, and appearance of lesions) in a series of 10 patients with 12 pathologically proven epithelioid angiomyolipomas of the liver were retrospectively analyzed. The imaging features, including attenuation/signal intensity characteristics, presence of fat, hypervascular, outer rim, and vessels within lesion, were evaluated and compared with that of non-Epi-HAML in 11 patients (13 lesions). The Fisher exact test was used to compare difference in probability of imaging features between the two types. RESULTS: For 21 patients, CT images of 15 patients and MR images of six patients were available. No patient underwent two examinations. For the 15 patients with a CT scan, all HAML lesions in the two groups (10 Epi-HAML and seven non-Epi-HAML) manifested as hypoattenuation. For the six patients with MRI, all lesions (two Epi-HAML and six non-Epi-HAML) were hypointense on T1WI (fat suppression) and hyperintense on T2WI. There were 10 non-Epi-HAML, but only two Epi-HAML lesions showed the presence of fat, which significantly different between the two types (P = 0.005). On the dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) imaging, eight Epi-HAML, and 13 non-Epi lesions manifested as hypervascular. Punctate or curved vessels were displayed in 10 Epi-HAML as well as in nine non-Epi lesions and outer rim enhancement could be found with eight Epi-HAML as well as six non-Epi lesions. CONCLUSION: Little or no presence of adipose tissue was found to be an imaging feature of Epi-HAML, compared with the non-Epi type. In addition, hypervascularity with opacification of central punctiform or filiform vessels on DCE would be a characteristic enhancement pattern for Epi-HAML. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

77949741047	Diagnostic methods for initial evaluation of primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors	Objectives: To describe the imaging features of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) at initial presentation with clinical, surgical, and pathologic correlation, and to evaluate values of various techniques in GISTs. Methods: This retrospective study recruited 70 patients with histologically proved GISTs between December 2004, and May 2009 in the Department of General Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan Univeristy, Shanghai, China. Each patient underwent CT scanning, 39 patients underwent simultaneous endoscopy, 12 patients underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and 36 patients underwent transabdominal ultrasonography (TAUS) simultaneously. Features of GISTs were assessed. Results: Computerized tomography findings showed an eccentric mass in 44 patients, an intraluminal component in 24, and a transmural distribution in 2. Forty-two tumors were dumbbell-shaped, 2 were round, while 26 were irregular. Forty-three tumors presented with well-defined masses, while 27 with unclear borders. The arterial phase attenuation showed the continuous enhancement. The portal-venous phase attenuation was heterogeneous in 26 and homogeneous in the other 44. There was a significant correlation between certain CT features and tumor risk stratification. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors were characterized by a smooth shape and normal overlying mucosa in endoscopy, hypoechoic, and solid in TAUS. Conclusion: Imaging examinations are pivotal in the management of GISTs. The CT scan is valuable in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning of GISTs. Endoscopy and EUS contribute to the detection of mucosal lesions. Other methods including TAUS, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, CT gastrography, and MRI help in specific cases.

77953764624	Effect of platelet-rich plasma, activated by different concentrations of thrombin, on the repair of cranial defects	BACKGROUND: The biological functions of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) are affected by multiple factors, such as individual difference, PRP concentration, PRP carrier, PRP-activated methods and so on. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of PRP, activated by different concentrations of thrombin, on the repair of cranial defects. METHODS: Whole blood of the central artery of rabbit ears was extracted to prepare PRP, which was then diluted so that the final platelet count was about 5 times of the whole blood. Four whole-thickness layer of cranial defects at an 8-mm diameter were created in 16 New Zealand rabbits and randomly grafted with β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and PRP, activated by 60 U/mL thrombin; β-TCP and PRP, activated by 1 000 U/mL thrombin; β-TCP and PRP; β-TCP alone. At 1 and 3 months following implantation, X-ray analysis and microscopic observation were performed to onserve cranial repair, the area percent of new bone formation was calculated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: At one month post-surgery, the edge of defects was clear in each group, with varying degrees of new bone formation surrounding the defects, β-TCP particles partially degraded and the degradation lesion was replaced by new bone, only a small amount of bone lacunae was seen, fiber wrapped around the defect center β-TCP, only a small number of specimens showed new bone formation; X-ray showed a clear boundary and uniform defect density; the percentage of new bone formation in the PRP groups were higher than β-TCP groups (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between PRP group groups (P > 0.05). At 3 months post-surgery, the defect boundary was unclear in each group, the new bone formation increased, the β-TCP particles surrounding defects partially or all degraded and were replaced by new bones, some regions appeared trabecular bone, bone lacuna in new bone was increased, the central defect of the majority of specimens exhibited new bone formation; X-ray showed defect boundary was unclear in each group, defect surrounding density was higher than the center defect, and bone mineral density was equivalent to other normal parts; the percentage of new bone formation in the PRP groups was significantly higher than that in the β-TCP groups (P < 0.05), PRP + β-TCP group was higher than the other 3 groups (P < 0.05), there was no significant difference between two thrombin groups (P > 0.05) . It is indicated that although PRP improves the repair of cranial defects, 60 and 1 000 U/mL of thrombin has no effects on PRP repairing cranial defects in New Zealand white rabbits, compared with PRP+β-TCP group, possible the absence of the optimal concentration of thrombin.

77955133619	Contribution of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the characterization of hepatocellular carcinomas and dysplastic nodules in cirrhotic liver	objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for the characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and dysplastic nodule (DN) in cirrhotic liver, compared with contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI). Methods: A total of 54 patients with 40 HCC and 19 DN lesions were included in our study, and all lesions were histopathologically confirmed. All lesions were evaluated with CE-MRI, and breath-hold DWI was performed with b = 500 s/mm. The signal intensity (SI) of the lesions were classified as low, iso-, slightly high, and strongly high SI compared with that of the surrounding liver parenchyma on DWI for qualitative assessment. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and lesion-to-liver ADC ratio of HCCs and DNs were measured and compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. The lesions were characterized with the use of CE-MRI criteria and DWI, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic value of DWI, CE-MRI, and these techniques combined in the differentiation of HCCs from DNs. Results: In the qualitative analysis, among 40 HCCs, 39 (97.5%) had slightly high or strongly high SI on DWI, and 1 (2.5%) had low SI; only 4 (21.5%) of 19 DNs had slightly high SI, and 15 (78.95%) had iso-SI or low SI. The mean (SD) ADC and ADC ratio for HCCs (1.28 × 10 [0.25] mm/s and 0.88 [0.15], respectively) were significantly lower (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) than those for DNs (1.53 × 10 [0.33] mm/s and 1.00 [0.08], respectively). The area, Az, under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the SI feature, the ADC ratio, and the ADCs based on the diagnosis of HCC versus DN were 0.88, 0.81, and 0.68, respectively. When the slightly high SI of lesion with a cutoff ADC ratio less than 0.92 was applied as a criterion, the Az, the sensitivity, the specificity, and the accuracy of DWI for the diagnosis of HCC versus DN were 0.81, 67.50%, 94.74%, and 76.27%, respectively. The corresponding Az, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CE-MRI were 0.70, 82.50%, 57.89%, and 74.58%, respectively. Combined DWI plus CE-MRI had 0.91 Az, 97.50% sensitivity, and 93.22% accuracy, which increased significantly compared with those of CE-MRI alone. Conclusions: Diffusion-weighted MRI can provide additional information to differentiate HCC from DN. Combined with CE-MRI, DWI allows improved characterization of HCC versus DN in cirrhotic liver. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77956912121	Application of autologous periosteal cells for the regeneration of class III furcation defects in Beagle dogs	The aim of this study was to evaluate the healing of class III furcation defects following transplantation of autogenous periosteal cells combined with β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). Periosteal cells obtained from Beagle dogs' periosteum explant cultures, were inoculated onto the surface of β-TCP. Class III furcation defects were created in the mandibular premolars. Three experimental groups were used to test the defects' healing: group A, β-TCP seeded with periosteal cells were transplanted into the defects; group B, β-TCP alone was used for defect filling; and group C, the defect was without filling materials. Twelve weeks post surgery, the tissue samples were collected for histology, immunohistology and X-ray examination. It was found that both the length of newly formed periodontal ligament and the area of newly formed alveolar bone in group A, were significantly increased compared with both group B and C. Furthermore, both the proportion of newly formed periodontal ligament and newly formed alveolar bone in group A were much higher than those of group B and C. The quantity of cementum and its percentage in the defects (group A) were also significantly higher than those of group C. These results indicate that autogenous periosteal cells combined with β-TCP application can improve periodontal tissue regeneration in class III furcation defects. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

78751511081	Wnt5a regulates growth, patterning, and odontoblast differentiation of developing mouse tooth	Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for tooth development beyond the bud stage, but little is known about the role of non-canonical Wnt signaling in odontogenesis. Here we compared the expression of Wnt5a, a representative of noncanonical Wnts, with that of Ror2, the Wnt5a receptor for non-canonical signaling, in the developing tooth, and analyzed tooth phenotype in Wnt5a mutants. Wnt5a-deficient mice exhibit retarded tooth development beginning from E16.5, leading to the formation of smaller and abnormally patterned teeth with a delayed odontoblast differentiation at birth. These defects are associated with upregulated Axin2 and Shh expression in the dental epithelium and reduced levels of cell proliferation in the dental epithelium and mesenchyme. Retarded tooth development and defective odontoblast differentiation were also observed in Ror2 mutant mice. Our results suggest that Wnt5a regulates growth, patterning, and odontoblast differentiation during odontogenesis, at least partially by modulating Wnt/β-catenin canonical signaling. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79851489411	Preliminary study on mr colonography with air enema in detection of colorectal neoplasms	Background The few studies on MR colonography with air enema involved feasibility of bowel distention and imaging quality and lacked detection sensitivity of colorectal neoplasms. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the detection sensitivity of colorectal neoplasms with the three-dimensional Fourier transform fast spoiled gradient-recalled MR colonography with air enema. Methods A total of 30 patients scheduled for optical colonoscopy due to rectal bleeding, positive fecal occult blood test results or altered bowel habits were recruited and successfully underwent entire colorectal examinations with three-dimensional Fourier transform fast spoiled gradient-recalled MR colonography and subsequent optical colonoscopy on the same day. Detection sensitivity of colorectal neoplasms with MR colonography was statistically analyzed on a per-neoplasm size basis by using findings from optical colonoscopy and histopathological examinations as the reference standards. Results Seventy-six neoplasms were detected with optical colonoscopy, consisting of 1 mm-5 mm (n=11), 6 mm-9 mm (n=29) and ≥10 mm (n=36) in diameter. Detection sensitivities of 1 mm-5 mm, 6 mm-9 mm, ≥10 mm and ≥6 mm colorectal neoplasms with MR colonography were 9.1%, 75.9%, 100% and 89.2%, respectively; overall detection sensitivity for all sizes colorectal neoplasms was 77.6%. Conclusions Detection sensitivity of three-dimensional Fourier transform fast spoiled gradient-recalled MR colonography with air enema is low for 1 mm-5 mm colorectal neoplasms, but the detection sensitivity is 89.2% for ≥6 mm neoplasms, and all ≥10 mm neoplasms could be detected.

79952917237	Alterations of serum lipid and inflammatory cytokine profiles in patients with coronary heart disease and chronic periodontitis: A pilot study	Serum lipid and inflammatory cytokine profiles were assessed in 124 in-patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (CHD group) and 43 in-patients with no evidence of CHD (control group). In all patients, research questionnaires and examinations of periodontal health were conducted and venous blood samples were analysed. Both groups were divided into two subgroups according to the presence or absence of chronic periodontitis in individual patients. The prevalence of chronic periodontitis was higher in patients from the CHD group than in the control group. Levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha were significantly higher in CHD patients with chronic periodontitis than in those without periodontitis. In conclusion, chronic periodontitis may be associated with CHD. © 2011 Field House Publishing LLP.

0036134141	Hepatic angiomyolipoma: Various appearances on two-phase contrast scanning of spiral CT	The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the various appearances of hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) on the two-phase contrast scans of spiral CT and find out the valuable signs suggesting the diagnosis. Spiral CT scanning of pre- and post-contrast arterial phase, portal venous phase were performed in 12 cases. We found that 11 of 12 lesions appeared as hypodense, the other one appeared as slightly hyperdense on pre-contrast CT scans. On the arterial phase, 11 lesions were markedly enhanced, with the central vasculature opacification in eight lesions; the only other lesion showed no marked enhancement, but with massive vessels seen within the lesion. On the portal venous phase, eight lesions remained in enhancement with the central vessels also seen in six lesions. Our results revealed that two-phase contrast scanning could demonstrate some characteristic features of AML, such as fat components within the lesions, hypervascular tumors, the absence of capsule. Especially the central vessels within the lesions suggested strongly the diagnosis of AML. As for atypical cases, the diagnosis remained difficult and should be differentiated from other hypervascular lesions by means of other imaging modalities or needle puncture biopsy.

79959240120	Unenhanced calf MR angiography at 3.0 T using electrocardiography-gated partial-fourier fast spin echo imaging with variable flip angle	Objective: This study was to evaluate diagnostic performance of unenhanced electrocardiography-gated fast spin echo based MRA with variable flip angle on 3.0 T for assessment of calf arteries in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Methods: 64 patients underwent unenhanced MRA (UE), time-resolved contrast-enhanced MRA of the calf and bolus-chase contrast-enhanced lower peripheral MRA (BCE). Diagnostic performance of UE was evaluated and compared with contrast-enhanced MRA in 61 patients and x-ray angiography in 10 patients. Results: With UE, 852 of 960 segments (88.75%) were diagnostic even in patients with arrhythmia, demonstrating similar image quality with those on BCE (P>0.05). For those diagnostic segments, statistics revealed good agreement between unenhanced and contrast-enhanced techniques with a Kappa value of 0.77 and 0.75 for stenosis detection and visualized vessel length, respectively. When using X-ray angiography as reference standard, no significant difference was found between UE and contrast-enhanced MRA concerning sensitivity and specificity in depiction of severe stenosis and occlusion (P>0.05). Conclusions: Although further technical refinements are required, this optimized UE technique may be used as a supplement to contrast-enhanced MRA particularly in patients with PAOD in whom venous contamination occurs frequently. © European Society of Radiology 2010.

79959399704	Substituted zinc phthalocyanine as an antimicrobial photosensitizer for periodontitis treatment	In the last decades the worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance has intensified the development of new antimicrobial agents. Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) has been used successfully to inactivate bacteria. We herein report a new zinc phthalocyanine based photosensitizer conjugated with polylysine moiety (ZnPc-PL). This photosensitizer significantly inactivated Porphyromonas gingivalis, the primary pathogenic bacteria responsible for periodontitis. No obvious phototoxicity was found to either mammalian bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) or human periodontal ligament cells (HPDLC), indicating the high selectivity of ZnPc-PL toward bacteria. Furthermore, we established an experimental periodontitis model on beagle dogs to test the antimicrobial efficacy in vivo. The amount of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and the activity of crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were monitored and were found to reduce significantly in the ZnPc-PL treated group compared to the controls (laser only and no treatment). In addition, PACT with ZnPc-PL caused a reduction in the bacterial burden by 100-fold compared to controls. Taken together, these findings suggest ZnPc-PL is a promising antimicrobial photosensitizer for the treatment of periodontal diseases. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

79959626144	Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide alters atherosclerotic-related gene expression in oxidized low-density-lipoprotein-induced macrophages and foam cells	Background and Objective: The molecular mechanism linking atherosclerosis formation and periodontal pathogens is not clear, although a positive correlation between periodontal infections and cardiovascular diseases has been reported. The aim of this study was to determine whether stimulation with Porphyromonasgingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affected the expression of atherosclerosis-related genes, during and after the formation of foam cells. Material and Methods: Macrophages from human THP-1 monocytes were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to induce the formation of foam cells. P. gingivalis LPS was added to cultures of either oxLDL-induced macrophages or foam cells. The expression of atherosclerosis-related genes was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR, and the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10 and IL-12 proteins was determined using ELISA.

Methods: Whole-body MRA was performed in 42 patients with TA. In 23 of them, precontrast and postcontrast high-resolution vessel wall imagings were acquired. Three of 23 patients had follow-up imaging after medical treatment. According to TA activity criteria, these 26 vessel wall imagings were clinically divided into 2 groups: active (n = 18) and remissive group (n = 8). Vessel wall thickness and postcontrast signal intensity of vessel wall relative to adjacent muscle were analyzed. Results: Whole-body MRA yielded a diagnostic image of systemic and pulmonary artery. For vessel wall imaging, wall thickness of the active group (6.12 ± 1.1 mm) was thicker than that of the remissive group (4.31 ± 0.98 mm; P < 0.05). Postcontrast signal intensity ratio was significantly different between 2 groups (active vs remissive, 1.56 ± 0.40 vs 1.17 ± 0.21, P < 0.05). Based on the abnormalities revealed by combined whole-body MRA and vessel wall imaging, Lupi-Herrera's classification was modified in 8 of 23 patients. Conclusions: Whole-body MRA combined with vessel wall imaging had the potential for a comprehensive evaluation of disease extent and activity of TA.

80054690924	Nondestructive imaging of elements distribution in biomedical samples by X-ray fluorescence computed tomography	X-ray fluorescence computed tomography is a stimulated emission tomography that allows nondestructive reconstruction of the elements distribution in the sample, which is important for biomedical investigations. Owing to the high flux density and easy energy tunability of highly collimated synchrotron X-rays, it is possible to apply X-ray fluorescence CT to biomedical samples. Reported in the present paper, an X-ray fluorescence CT system was established at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility for the investigations of trace elements distribution inside biomedical samples. By optimizing the experiment setup, the spatial resolution was improved and the data acquisition process was obviously speeded up. The maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm was introduced for the image reconstruction, which remarkably improved the imaging accuracy of element distributions. The developed system was verified by the test sample and medical sample respectively. The results showed that the distribution of interested elements could be imaged correctly, and the spatial resolution of 150 m was achieved. In conclusion, the developed system could be applied to the research on large-size biomedical samples, concerning imaging accuracy, spatial resolution and data collection time.

84857547096	Fast and accurate X-ray fluorescence computed tomography imaging with the ordered-subsets expectation maximization algorithm	The ordered-subsets expectation maximization algorithm (OSEM) is introduced to X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT) and studied; here, simulations and experimental results are presented. The simulation results indicate that OSEM is more accurate than the filtered back-projection algorithm, and it can efficiently suppress the deterioration of image quality within a large range of angular sampling intervals. Experimental results of both an artificial phantom and cirrhotic liver show that with a satisfying image quality the angular sampling interval could be improved to save on the data-acquisition time when OSEM is employed. In addition, with an optimum number of subsets, the image reconstruction time of OSEM could be reduced to about half of the time required for one subset. Accordingly, it can be concluded that OSEM is a potential method for fast and accurate XFCT imaging. © 2012 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - All rights reserved.

84857062035	Evaluation of Takayasu arteritis activity by delayed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging	Background: To measure and assess the disease activity of Takayasu arteritis (TA) quantitatively by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Methods: Twenty-six Chinese TA patients were divided into an active group and an inactive group. All patients underwent delayed contrast-enhanced MRI. The vessels involved were categorized into type A (main branches of aorta and its arch) and type B (secondary or tertiary branches). Three quantitative scores were defined to gauge lumen stenosis, vessel wall thickness, and vessel wall enhancement, and compared between groups and types. Results: The patients in the active group had more stenosis in left subclavian artery than those in the inactive group (14/16, 87.5% vs. 2/10, 20%; p < 0.01), and greater vessel wall thickness in left common carotid artery (11/16, 68.75% vs. 1/10, 10%; p < 0.01) and left subclavian artery (9/16, 56.25% vs. 0/10, 0%; p < 0.01). The differences between active and inactive TA were significant in type A (lumen stenosis: 11.13 ± 6.17 vs. 4.00 ± 4.32; p < 0.001; wall thickness: 8.00 ± 5.05 vs. 3.10 ± 3.31; p = 0.01; wall enhancement: 6.94 ± 5.34 vs. 2.90 ± 4.36; p = 0.05), and pronounced in type A + B (lumen stenosis: 13.31 ± 7.19 vs. 6.30 ± 5.60; p = 0.02; wall thickness: 8.50 ± 5.29 vs. 3.40 ± 3.34; p = 0.01; wall enhancement: 7.94 ± 6.55 vs. 3.20 ± 4.32, p = 0.05, respectively). These three scores were moderately correlated to CRP, platelet count and fibrinogen levels (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The MRI scoring system of lumen stenosis, wall thickness and wall enhancement could be a non-invasive approach to facilitate assessment in TA activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84863091212	Value of abdominal susceptibilityweighted magnetic resonance imaging for quantitative assessment of hepatic iron deposition in patients with chronic hepatitis B: Comparison with serum iron markers	Objective: To assess hepatic iron deposition quantitatively in patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection, using abdominal susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SWI). METHODS: Patients with HBV infection and healthy controls underwent abdominal SWI and were assessed for serum iron markers. Phase values were measured and five grades of hepatic iron deposition were described by SWI. RESULTS: Patients with HBV infection (n = 327) and healthy controls (n = 50) were prospectively enrolled. In total, 77 (25.4%) patients with HBV infection had hepatic iron deposition as determined by SWI. Phase values were significantly different between patients with hepatic iron deposition compared with patients without hepatic iron deposition or controls, and were significantly different across different grades of hepatic iron deposition. Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin and transferrin saturation were significantly higher in patients with, versus those without, hepatic iron deposition. Only serum ferritin was significantly different across different grades of hepatic iron deposition, and there was a low inverse correlation between serum ferritin and phase values. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with serum iron markers, abdominal SWI may represent a powerful tool to assess hepatic iron deposition quantitatively in patients with chronic HBV infection. © 2012 Field House Publishing LLP.

0038205716	MR dynamic gadolinium-enhanced fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo and spin-echo T1-weighted fat-suppressed techniques in diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma	Objective: To evaluate the value of MR dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMPSPGR) and spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted fat-suppressed techniques in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. Methods: Eighteen cases of pancreatic carcinoma verified by surgical and pathologic results were examined by MR, and the MR sequences included SE T1WI, FSE T2WI, SE T1-weighted fat-suppressed and dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced FMPSPGR. Results: Of 18 pancreatic carcinomas, 10, 6, and 2 tumors showed respectively hypo-intensity, iso-intensity and hyper-intensity on SE T1WI, meanwhile, 8, 6, and 4 tumors displayed hyper-intensity, iso-intensity and hypo-intensity on FSE T2WI in comparison with the normal pancreatic tissue. All of the tumors showed hypo-intensity on SE T1-weighted fat-suppressed and also obvious non-enhancement or slight enhancement on MR dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced FMPSPGR images during the arterial dominant phase scanning. Conclusion: SE T1-weighted fat-suppressed and MR dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced FMPSPGR sequences could evidently improve the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.

0038205902	Arterial phase of biphase enhancement spiral CT in diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma	Objectives: To evaluate the value of the arterial phase (AP) of biphase enhanced spiral CT(SCT) in the diagnosis of small HCC and to investigate the criteria, initial time, ending time and duration of AP. Methods: From May 1995 to March 1999, patients with small HCC proved surgically and pathologically including 49 patients (n=53) in group A, 148 (n=186) in group B and 52 (n=52) in group C were collected. Biphase dynamic enhanced SCT scans were performed in all patients of the three groups and additional single-level dynamic scans only done in the group C. The detectability, diagnostic accuracy of lesions and enhancement of the lesions in AP were analyzed statistically. In addition, the initial time, ending time and duration of AP were measured. Results: The results of the group A showed the detectability of small HCC was 88.68% in AP and 90.57% in both phases, higher than those by ultrasound. Markedly enhanced lesions in AP accounted for 76% and 78% in the groups B and C respectively. The initial time, ending time and duration of AP measured on single-level dynamic scans were 16.9 s, 39.6 s and 22.7 s on average respectively. Conclusions: The biphase dynamic SCT especially its arterial phase appears to be very valuable in diagnosing small HCCs. In light of short duration of AP, understanding and strict control of AP is obviously imperative.

0038649777	Enhancement patterns of small hepatocellular carcinoma shown by dynamic MRI and CT	Objectives: To study prospectively the enhancement features of small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC) with multi-phase scanning of dynamic MRI and spiral CT, and discuss the superiority of dynamic MRI to spiral CT. Methods: Multi-phase dynamic contrast scanning of high field MRI and spiral CT were performed in 53 patients with SHCC. The arterial phase, portal venous phase and delayed phase scanning of spiral CT was done after the pre-contrast scanning of the entire liver. MRI was performed with SE sequence and fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-recalled sequence dynamic multi-phase contrast scanning. Results: Seventy-six lesions were found in all 53 patients. Sixty-nine and 54 of the 76 lesions enhanced obviously in MRI and spiral CT arterial phase scanning respectively. The typical enhancement patterns of SHCC in the arterial phase, portal venous phase and delayed phase scanning of MRI and spiral CT were hyper-hypo-hypointense (dense) and hyper-iso-hypointense (dense). Atypical enhancement patterns were hyper-hyper-hyperintense (dense), hyper-iso-isointense (dense) and hypo-hypo-hypointense (dense). Conclusions: Both MRI and spiral CT multi-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced scanning could demonstrate the enhancement features of SHCC, and arterial phase scan of MRI was superior to spiral CT in reflecting the hypervascular characterization of SHCC. In addition, MRI was better than spiral CT in characterization of hepatic lesions combined with SE sequence.

84871337130	Spectral CT imaging of myocardial infarction: Preliminary animal experience	Objectives: To evaluate the capability of spectral CT imaging to detect the different stages and angiogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI). Methods: MI was surgically induced in 40 rabbits that were evenly divided into four stages of MI: 6 h (6H), 3 days (3D), 7 days (7D) and 14 days (14D). Spectral CT was performed at 10 s, 1 min and 3 min after intravenous contrast medium administration. CD31 immunohistochemistry was used for the microvessel density (MVD) measurement. Iodine concentrations in the myocardium were measured and normalised to the aorta as nIC. The relationships between infarcted myocardial nIC and MVD were analysed. Results: The nIC of infarct myocardium decreased at 10 s and increased in late-phase CT images. There were significant differences between the 6H and other groups (P

84871948403	Storage media enhance osteoclastogenic potential of human periodontal ligament cells via RANKL-independent signaling	Background: Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and milk have gained wide acceptance as storage media for avulsed tooth. However, the effect of the media and storage time on the periodontal ligament (PDL) cells involvement in the development of root resorption is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether precultured PDL cells in HBSS, milk, or modified Eagle's medium alpha (α-MEM) would affect osteoclastogenesis. Materials and methods: PDL cells were precultured in HBSS, milk, or α-MEM for 1h or 6h before being co-cultured with RAW 264.7 cells for an additional 3days for mRNA analysis and 11days for osteoclastogenesis assay. Results: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA was detected immediately in PDL cells precultured in the three storage media. The expression was up-regulated markedly in all co-cultures when compared with RAW cells alone. As a result of the co-culture, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression was detectable in both PDL and RAW cells. TRAP+ multinucleated, osteoclast-like cells developed in all co-cultures; the number of TRAP+ cells was highest (P<0.05) in the co-cultures that PDL cells precultured in milk for 6h. The mRNA level of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) was not detected in PDL cells. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA expression reduced with increased preculture time, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). Conclusions: PDL cells kept in the three storage media led to TRAP+ multinucleated, osteoclast-like cells formation via RANKL-independent signaling. The ability to induce osteoclastogenesis may be considered as one of the factors to evaluate the ability of storage medium to maintain PDL viability after tooth avulsion. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84872852844	Contrast media volume optimization in high-pitch dual-source CT coronary angiography: Feasibility study	To investigate the feasibility of contrast media (CM) volume reduction in dual-source coronary computed tomography angiography high-pitch mode without affecting coronary artery enhancement. Eighty patients were involved in a preliminary experiment with a default injection protocol (60 ml of CM). The age, BMI, test bolus (TB) enhancement peak and the CT values of coronary artery for each patient were recorded and the key factors for determining coronary artery enhancement were investigated. Based on the results of the preliminary experiment, 120 patients were involved in the main experiment with a new injection protocol. For each patient, the CT values and noise of left coronary sinus (LCS), and the distal segment of right coronary artery were measured. In the preliminary experiment, the peak enhancement of TB correlated most strongly with the HU values of coronary artery. Consequently, the new injection protocol was devised to catalog patients into four groups (30, 40, 50 and 60 ml) of CM based on their TB peak enhancement. In the main experiment, the 30 ml CM injection group whose peak attenuation of TB were the highest (30 vs. 40,50,60 ml: 323.0 ± 27.5 vs. 264.2 ± 11.9, 242.1 ± 8.8, 206.2 ± 18.2 HU, p < 0.05), obtained the highest attenuation of LCS (30 vs. 40,50,60 ml: 365.0 ± 41.2 vs. 341.8 ± 40.0, 326.9 ± 34.7, 312.5 ± 38.2 HU p < 0.05). Contrast optimization is feasible in high-pitch DSCT coronary angiography. Certain patients may receive 30 ml of CM without affecting vessel enhancement. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

84873711189	Gastric Cancer Staging with Dual Energy Spectral CT Imaging	Purpose: To evaluate the clinical utility of dual energy spectral CT (DEsCT) in staging and characterizing gastric cancers. Materials and Methods: 96 patients suspected of gastric cancers underwent dual-phasic scans (arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP)) with DEsCT mode. Three types of images were reconstructed for analysis: conventional polychromatic images, material-decomposition images, and monochromatic image sets with photon energies from 40 to 140 keV. The polychromatic and monochromatic images were compared in TNM staging. The iodine concentrations in the lesions and lymph nodes were measured on the iodine-based material-decomposition images. These values were further normalized against that in aorta and the normalized iodine concentration (nIC) values were statistically compared. Results were correlated with pathological findings. Results: The overall accuracies for T, N and M staging were (81.2%, 80.0%, and 98.9%) and (73.9%, 75.0%, and 98.9%) determined with the monochromatic images and the conventional kVp images, respectively. The improvement of the accuracy in N-staging using the keV images was statistically significant (p<0.05). The nIC values between the differentiated and undifferentiated carcinoma and between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes were significantly different both in AP (p = 0.02, respectively) and PP (p = 0.01, respectively). Among metastatic lymph nodes, nIC of the signet-ring cell carcinoma were significantly different from the adenocarcinoma (p = 0.02) and mucinous adenocarcinoma (p = 0.01) in PP. Conclusion: The monochromatic images obtained with DEsCT may be used to improve the N-staging accuracy. Quantitative iodine concentration measurements may be helpful for differentiating between differentiated and undifferentiated gastric carcinoma, and between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes. © 2013 Pan et al.

84873996292	Multicenter, intraindividual comparison of single-dose gadobenate dimeglumine and double-dose gadopentetate dimeglumine for mr angiography of the supra-aortic arteries (the supra-aortic value study)	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gadobenate dimeglumine has markedly higher R1 relaxivity compared to gadopentetate dimeglumine meaning that lower doses can be used to achieve similar contrast enhancement. Our aim was to prospectively compare single-dose gadobenate dimeglumine with double-dose gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast-enhanced MRA of the supra-aortic vasculature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients (37 men, 9 women; mean age, 63.5±10.1 years) with known or suspected steno-occlusive disease of the supra-aortic vessels underwent 2 identical CE-MRA examinations at 1.5T. Contrast agents were administered in randomized order, with the 2-fold greater volume of gadopentetate dimeglumine injected at a 2 times faster rate. Image assessment was performed by 3 independent blinded readers for vessel anatomic delineation, detection/exclusion of pathology, and global preference. Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV) for detection of ≥60% stenosis was determined for 39/46 patients who underwent preinterventional DSA. Data were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank, McNemar, and Wald tests in terms of the noninferiority of single-dose gadobenate dimeglumine compared with double-dose gadopentetate dimeglumine. Quantitative enhancement (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)) was also compared. RESULTS: All images were technically adequate. No differences (P 1.0) were noted by any reader for any qualitative parameter. All readers considered single-dose gadobenate dimeglumine and double-dose gadopentetate dimeglumine equivalent in at least 42/46 patients (91.3% three-reader agreement) for all parameters. Nonsignificant superiority for gadobenate dimeglumine was reported for all diagnostic performance indicators (sensitivity: 82.7%- 88.5% versus 75.0%- 80.8%; specificity: 96.4%-98.6% versus 94.6%-98.6%; accuracy: 94.6%-96.1% versus 92.4%-94.9%; PPV: 81.5%-91.5% versus 73.7%-90.7%; NPV: 96.8%-97.8% versus 95.4%-96.4%). No differences (P>.05) in quantitative enhancement were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The image quality and diagnostic performance achieved with 0.1-mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine is at least equivalent to that achieved with 0.2-mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine.

84874760441	Serum bone formation marker correlation with improved osseointegration in osteoporotic rats treated with simvastatin	Objective: Simvastatin has been shown to enhance osseointegration of pure titanium implants in osteoporotic rats. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the serum level of bone formation markers and the osseointegration of pure titanium implants in osteoporotic rats treated with simvastatin. Materials and methods: Fifty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 3 months, were randomly divided into three groups: Sham-operated group (SHAM; n = 18), ovariectomized group (OVX; n = 18), and ovariectomized with simvastatin treatment group (OVX + SIM; n = 18). Fifty-six days after ovariectomy, screw-shaped titanium implants were inserted into the tibiae. Simvastatin was administered orally at 5 mg/kg each day after the placement of the implant in the OVX + SIM group. The animals were killed at either 28 or 84 days after implantation and the undecalcified tissue sections were processed for histological analysis. Total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and bone Gla protein (BGP) were measured in all animal sera collected at the time of euthanasia and correlated with the histological assessment of osseointegration. Results: The level of ALP in the OVX group was higher than the SHAM group at day 28, with no differences between the three groups at day 84. The level of BALP in the OVX + SIM group was significantly higher than both OVX and SHAM groups at days 28. Compared with day 28, the BALP level of all three groups showed a significant decrease at day 84. There were no significant differences in BGP levels between the three groups at day 28, but at day 84, the OVX + SIM group showed significantly higher levels than both the OVX and SHAM groups. There was a significant increase in BGP levels between days 28 and 84 in the OVX + SIM group. The serum bone marker levels correlated with the histological assessment showing reduced osseointegration in the OVX compared to the SHAM group which is subsequently reversed in the OVX + SIM group. Conclusion: The results from this study indicate that the serum level of bone formation markers, especially BALP and BGP, could be correlated with the degree of osseointegration around titanium implants in osteoporotic rats treated with simvastatin. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84874992808	Values of spectral CT imaging in differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia	Objective: To explore the application value of spectral CT multi-parameter imaging in the differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and focal nodular hyperplasia(FNH). Methods: Forty-eight patients with hepatic lesions underwent gemstone spectral imaging (GSI) scans, including 32 HCC and 16 FNH, to obtain spectral serial images for the arterial phase and portal venous phase (PVP). The spectral parameters of lesions, normal hepatic tissue and the aorta were measured. Then, the lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the different energy levels, normalized iodine concentration (NIC), the lesion-normal parenchyma iodine concentration ratio (LNR) and iodine concentration difference (ICD) between the arterial phase and the portal venous phase were calculated. The above measurement results were analyzed with two samples t test and ROC curve. Results: The CNR of HCC and FNH in the different energy levels showed a certain regularity. In general, with the single photon energy increased, the CNR decreased except for some energy points. For HCC and FNH, the optimal CNR were 3.59 ±2.13 and 8.29 ± 2.65, respectively, during the arterial phase and 1.80 ±0.42 and 1.06 ±0.34, respectively, during the portal venous phase. The NIC were 0.25 ± 0.08 and 0.42 ± 0.22, respectively, during the arterial phase and 0.52 ±0.14 and 0.86 ±0.18 Respectively, during the portal venous phase. The LNR were 2.97 ±0.50 and 6.15 ±0.97, respectively, during the arterial phase and 0.99 ±0.19 and 1.22 ±0.26, respectively, during the portal venous phase. The ICD were (0.35 ±0.14) and (1.17 ± 0.28) g/L, respectively. The NIC, LNR and ICD for HCC were less than FNH during the arterial phase and the portal venous phase. There were significant differences in NIC(t = - 3.196, the arterial phase; t = -6.518, the portal venous phase), LNR (t= -12.911, the arterial phase; t = - 3.260, the portal venous phase), and ICD(z = - 2.754) between HCC and FNH (P <0.05). LNR in the arterial phase had the highest sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100% in differentiating HCC from FNH. Conclusion: The use of spectral CT with the quantitative analysis of iodine concentration might be helpful for increasing the efficiency of the detection and accuracy of diagnosis of HCC and FNH.

84874993101	Comparative study of radiation dose and image noise between single-source fast kilo voltage peak switching technique and conventional mode on abdominal CT	Objective: To investigate the radiation dose and image noise of abdominal CT with spectral imaging and conventional scan mode. Methods: This was a retrospective study. The first part of this study was a phantom study. A standard quality assessment phantom was scanned with gemstone spectral imaging mode and conventional helical mode using 120 kVp with different mAs. A regression function for the mAs between conventional scan mode and spectral imaging mode was obtained. According to the regression function, the mAs on 120 kVp corresponding to different gemstone spectral imaging protocol were calculated. The second part of this study was a clinical study. Twenty-two patients who underwent contrast enhanced abdominal CT scanning were included. The pre-contrast CT was scanned by a conventional mode with automatic exposure control technique. According to the mAs of pre-contrast scan, corresponding spectral imaging parameters were selected for the portal venous phase of post-contrast scan. Five sets of images with 5 mm slice thickness were reconstructed, with 65 keV monochromatic image for spectral imaging and FBP, 20%, 40% and 60% ASIR image for conventional imaging respectively. Image noise was measured on hepatic parenchyma and urinary bladder for each set of image. Radiation dose and image noise were compared between CT spectral imaging and conventional imaging with paired t-test. Results: No significant differences were found for the CTDIvol [(13.8 ±4. 8) mGy versus (14.0 ±7.0) mGy] and DLP [(691.1 ±274.2) mGy · cm versus (678.8 ± 385.0) mGy · cm] between CT spectral imaging and conventional imaging. Monochromatic image (65 keV) by spectral imaging [(7.6 ± 1.4) HU for hepatic parenchyma and (9.1 ±1.3) HU for urinary bladder] had equal image noise with 40% ASIR [hepatic parenchyma: (7.8 ± 0.7) HU] and 20% ASIR [urinary bladder: (9.2 ± 1.2) HU] and lower image noise than FBP image [(10.4 ± 1.0) HU for hepatic parenchyma and (10.5 ± 1.3) HU for urinary bladder] by conventional imaging. Conclusions: The radiation dose of CT spectral imaging and conventional CT scan is equivalent with spectral imaging parameters appropriately selected. Monochromatic image (65 keV) by CT spectral imaging has lower image noise than FBP image, and same image noise with 40% ASIR (hepatic parenchyma) and 20% ASIR (urinary bladder) by conventional imaging.

84875418087	Can sinogram-affirmed iterative (SAFIRE) reconstruction improve imaging quality on low-dose lung CT screening compared with traditional filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of sinogram-affirmed iterative (SAFIRE) reconstruction on image quality of low-dose lung computed tomographic (CT) screening compared with filtered back projection (FBP). METHODS: Three hundred four patients for annual low-dose lung CT screening were examined by a dual-source CT system at 120 kilovolt (peak) with reference tube current of 40 mA•s. Six image serials were reconstructed, including one data set of FBP and 5 data sets of SAFIRE with different reconstruction strengths from 1 to 5. Image noise was recorded; and subjective scores of image noise, images artifacts, and the overall image quality were also assessed by 2 radiologists. RESULTS: The mean ± SD weight for all patients was 66.3 ± 12.8 kg, and the body mass index was 23.4 ± 3.2. The mean ± SD dose-length product was 95.2 ± 30.6 mGy cm, and the mean ± SD effective dose was 1.6 ± 0.5 mSv. The observation agreements for image noise grade, artifact grade, and the overall image quality were 0.785, 0.595 and 0.512, respectively. Among the overall 6 data sets, both the measured mean objective image noise and the subjective image noise of FBP was the highest, and the image noise decreased with the increasing of SAFIRE reconstruction strength. The data sets of S3 obtained the best image quality scores. CONCLUSION: Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction can significantly improve image quality of low-dose lung CT screening compared with FBP, and SAFIRE with reconstruction strength 3 was a pertinent choice for low-dose lung CT.

84876232892	Effects of simvastatin on femoral biomechanics in ovariectomized ratss	Objective: To investigate the effect of simvastatin on the biomechanical characteristics of the femur in ovariectomized rats. Material and methods: Fifty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats, aged three months old, were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated group (SHAM; n = 18), ovariectomized group (OVX; n = 18), and ovariectomized with simvastatin treatment group (OVX+SIM; n = 18). Eight weeks after being ovariectomized, simvastatin was administered orally at 5 mg/kg each day in the OVX + SIM group. The animals were sacrificed at either four or 12 weeks after administration and femurs were obtained. Biomechanical parameters were measured by the three-point bending test. Results: There were no significant differences in the maximal strain and flexibility strain between the OVX and OVX + SIM groups at either four or 12 weeks after administration (p > 0.05). In contrast, significant differences in flexibility loading at four weeks and in maximal loading, flexibility loading, and the coefficient of bending ductility between the OVX and OVX + SIM groups at either four or 12 weeks (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Intergroup comparisons showed that maximal loading and flexibility loading have significant differences in the OVX + SIM group (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Simvastatin shows potential in promoting bone remodeling, changing bone micro-architecture, and influencing the integration and distribution ratio of organic and inorganic constituents in bone tissue of ovariectomized rats. In addition, a longer time of administration with simvastatin could enhance the femoral strength. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84878685862	Hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: Differentiation with CT spectral imaging	Objectives: To investigate the value of CT spectral imaging in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) during the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP). Methods: Fifty-eight patients with 42 HCCs and 16 FNHs underwent spectral CT during AP and PP. The lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at different energy levels, normalised iodine concentrations (NIC) and the lesion-normal parenchyma iodine concentration ratio (LNR) were calculated. The two-sample t test compared quantitative parameters. Two readers qualitatively assessed lesion types according to imaging features. Sensitivity and specificity of the qualitative and quantitative studies were compared. Results: In general, CNRs at low energy levels (40-70 keV) were higher than those at high energy levels (80-140 keV). NICs and LNRs for HCC differed significantly from those of FNH: mean NICs were 0.25 mg/mL ± 0.08 versus 0.42 mg/mL ± 0.12 in AP and 0.52 mg/mL ± 0.14 versus 0.86 mg/mL ± 0.18 in PP. Mean LNRs were 2.97 ± 0.50 versus 6.15 ± 0.62 in AP and 0.99 ± 0.12 versus 1.22 ± 0.26 in PP. NICs and LNRs for HCC were lower than those of FNH. LNR in AP had the highest sensitivity and specificity in differentiating HCC from FNH. Conclusions: CT spectral imaging may help to increase detectability of lesions and accuracy of differentiating HCC from FNH. Key Points: • CT spectral imaging may help to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). • CT spectral imaging may help differentiate HCC from focal nodular hyperplasia. • Quantitative analysis of iodine concentration provides greater diagnostic confidence. • Treatment can be given with greater confidence. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.

84880253680	Hyperlipidemia modifies innate immune responses to lipopolysaccharide via the TLR-NF-κB signaling pathway	The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hyperlipidemia (HLP) on innate immune responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Male New Zealand white rabbits were fed a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. In vivo, the rabbits were injected intravenously with LPS for 24 h. In vitro, peripheral mononuclear cells were collected and stimulated (or unstimulated) with LPS for 24 h. Assay results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA or an equivalent non-parametric test. A P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Despite having no influence in body weight, the HFD intake significantly increased serum lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), nuclear factor (NF)-κB subunit p65, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, SR-A and FAS. Although we found increased circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, CRP, IL-1β, and IL-10 in the ND-fed rabbits, no significant difference was found in the LPS-stimulated production of TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP in the HFD-fed rabbits. The macrophages harvested from the HFD-fed rabbits developed a blunted inflammatory response, with lower mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, CRP, TLR-4, SR-A, FAS, and Bcl-2 than that expressed by the ND group. In the HFD-fed animals, LPS incubation decreased NF-κB subunit p65 expression, whereas the cytoplasmic phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB protein was enhanced. These data indicate that HLP displayed a form of innate immune paralysis, including reduced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine release to external stimulus, which was related to the altered TLR-NF-κB signaling pathway and altered pro- and anti-apoptotic processes in macrophages. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84880354684	Evaluation of computer-assisted quantitative volumetric analysis for pre-operative resectability assessment of huge hepatocellular carcinoma	Purpose: Hepatic resection is arguably the preferred treatment for huge hepatocellular carcinoma (H-HCC). Estimating the remnant liver volume is therefore essential. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using computer-assisted volumetric analysis for this purpose. Methods: The study involved 40 patients with H-HCC. Laboratory examinations were conducted, and a contrast CT-scan revealed that 30 cases out of the participating 40 had single-lesion tumors. The remaining 10 had less than three satellite tumors. With the consensus of the team, two physicians conducted computer-assisted 3D segmentation of the liver, tumor, and vessels in each case. Volume was automatically computed from each segmented/labeled anatomical field. To estimate the resection volume, virtual lobectomy was applied to the main tumor. A margin greater than 1 cm was applied to the satellite tumors. Resectability was predicted by computing a ratio of functional liver resection (R) as (Vresected- Vtumor)/(Vtotal-Vtumor) x 100%, applying a threshold of 50% and 60% for cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic cases, respectively. This estimation was then compared with surgical findings. Results: Out of the 22 patients who had undergone hepatectomies, only one had an R that exceeded the threshold. Among the remaining 18 patients with non-resectable H-HCC, 12 had Rs that exceeded the specified ratio and the remaining 6 had Rs that were < 50%. Four of the patients who had Rs less than 50% under went incomplete surgery due to operative findings of more extensive satellite tumors, vascular invasion, or metastasis. The other two cases did not undergo surgery because of the high risk involved in removing the tumor. Overall, the ratio of functional liver resection for estimating resectability correlated well with the other surgical findings. Conclusion: Efficient pre-operative resectability assessment of H-HCC using computer-assisted volumetric analysis is feasible.

84881165709	Differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from angiomyolipoma of the liver with CT spectral imaging: A preliminary study	Aim To investigate the value of computed tomography (CT) spectral imaging in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from angiomyolipoma (AML) during the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP). Materials and method Fifty-three patients underwent spectral CT during the AP and PP. Forty-five patients had 45 HCC and eight patients had eight AML. Iodine concentrations in the lesions were normalized to those of the aorta. The normalized iodine concentrations (NIC) and the lesion-normal parenchyma iodine concentration ratio (LNR) were calculated. The two-sample t-test was performed to compare quantitative parameters. Two readers qualitatively assessed lesion types on the basis of imaging features. Sensitivity and specificity were compared between the qualitative and quantitative studies. Results NICs and LNRs in patients with HCC differed significantly from those in patients with AML: mean NICs were 0.25 ± 0.06 mg/ml versus 0.59 ± 0.03 mg/ml, respectively, during the AP and 0.52 ± 0.12 mg/ml versus 0.78 ± 0.03 mg/ml, respectively, during the PP. Mean LNRs were 2.97 ± 0.42 versus 5.85 ± 0.43, respectively, during the AP and 0.99 ± 0.17 versus 1.36 ± 0.05, respectively, during the PP. The NICs and LNRs for HCC were lower than those of AML during the AP and PP. The differences were significant (p < 0.05). The threshold NIC and LNR had high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating HCC from AML. Conclusion CT spectral imaging with the quantitative analysis of iodine concentration may help increase the accuracy of differentiating HCC from AML. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.

84881619069	The value of pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) for evaluating disease status in Takayasu's arteritis (TA)	Objective: To investigate the value of pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) for evaluating the disease status in Takayasu's arteritis (TA). Methods: Circulating PTX-3 level was determined in 45 Chinese TA patients, 25 healthy donors and 10 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients from October, 2010 to March, 2012. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to detect the plasma PTX-3 level. Kerr's index was used as the golden standard of disease activity. Results: PTX-3 plasma level in TA patients was significantly higher than those in healthy controls [(18.5±13.9) ng/mL vs. (0.52±0.26) ng/mL, P<0.01] and RA patients [(18.5±13.9) ng/mL vs. (0.73±0.47 ng/mL), P<0.01]; however, PTX-3 levels were similar in healthy donors and RA controls (P=0.49). Plasma level of PTX-3 was significantly higher in active TA than inactive TA patients [(26.7±16.8) ng/mL vs. (6.2±4.7) ng/mL, P<0.01], and was positively related to TA disease activity score (Rho=0.78, P<0.01) and serum MMP-9 levels (Rho=0.65, P<0.01). Furthermore, plasma PTX-3 level was positively related to the serum matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level (Rho=0.65, P<0.01), severity of lumen stenosis (Rho=0.67, P=0.04) and wall thickness (Rho=0.54, P=0.05) on the delayed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of TA patients. PTX-3 (≥10.71 ng/mL) had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 88.89%, 77.78% and 84.44% to identify TA disease activity (area under the ROC curve=0.95, 95% CI: 0.89-1.00). Conclusions: PTX-3 may be sensitive and specific for the evaluation of disease status in TA, and might also reflect prior vessel damage, and monitor disease progression.

84883376444	Application of dual energy heart imaging in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency	Objective: To investigate the application of dual energy heart imaging in evaluation of coronary artery, first-past myocardial perfusion and left ventricular cardiac function in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency. Methods: The results of dual energy CT-helical (DECT-helical) in 20 patients confirmed as moderate to severe renal insufficiency were retrospectively analysed, the coronary artery stenosis, myocardial perfusion imaging and cardiac function were evaluated, and the correlation among the three items was explored. Besides, the consistency of heart function analysed by dual-source CT (DSCT) and echocardiogram was determined. Results: A total of 248 coronary segments in 20 patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were analysed, among whom 14 had different degrees of pathological changes, involving 60 coronary segments, and most patients had multi-vessel lesion with mild stenosis of the lumen. A total of 340 segments of myocardial perfusion were analysed, and 15 patients had perfusion defects, involving 72 myocardial segments. There were significant differences in the iodine values among defective perfusion region, sparse perfusion region and normal myocardium (P<0.01). Twelve patients had abnormal left ventricular cardiac function, among whom 9 had whole cardiac anomalies and 11 had regional wall movement abnormalities, which involved 61 myocardial segments. The consistency of end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and ejection fraction between DSCT and echocardiogram was favorable. Conclusion: DECT-helical can evaluate the morphology of coronary artery, first-past myocardial perfusion and left ventricular cardiac function in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency with appropriate heart rate, and can comprehensively make diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.

84886891682	Multicenter, intra-individual comparison of single dose gadobenate dimeglumine and double dose gadopentetate dimeglumine for MR angiography of the peripheral arteries (the Peripheral VALUE Study)	Purpose To prospectively compare single dose gadobenate dimeglumine with double dose gadopentetate dimeglumine for CE-MRA in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) using an intra-individual crossover study design in which all patients received both contrast agents in otherwise identical CE-MRA examinations. Materials and Methods Institutional review board and regulatory approval were granted and all patients provided written informed consent. Sixty-eight patients (53M/15F; 62.4 ± 15.7 years) with mild-to-severe PAOD were enrolled for randomized 3-station CE-MRA with 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine and 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine. Three blinded readers assessed images for vessel anatomical delineation, disease detection/exclusion, and global preference. Diagnostic performance for detection of ≥51% stenosis was determined for 53 patients who underwent DSA. Noninferiority was assessed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank, McNemar, and Wald tests. Quantitative enhancement was compared. Results No differences (P ≥ 0.25) were noted for any qualitative parameter at any station. Equivalence was reported in at least 62/64 patients (93.8% 3-reader agreement) for diagnostic preference. Superiority for gadobenate dimeglumine was reported by all readers for diagnostic performance (sensitivity: 80.4-88.0% versus 75.2-85.8%; specificity: 89.8-96.0% versus 88.7-94.8%; accuracy: 87.4-91.7% versus 84.9-90.6%; PPV: 84.0-92.8% versus 82.3-90.8%; NPV: 88.5-92.4% versus 85.7-91.1%). Quantitative enhancement was similar in the pelvis but significantly (P < 0.05) greater with gadobenate dimeglumine in the thigh for two readers. Conclusion Image quality and diagnostic performance on peripheral CE-MRA with 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine is at least equivalent to that with 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine.

0142152163	Role of multiphase scans by multirow-detector helical CT in detecting small hepatocellular carcinoma	Aim: To evaluate the role of multiphasic scanning by multirow-detector helical CT (MDCT) in detecing small hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC). Methods: Multiphasic scanning was carried out in 75 patients with SHCC with Marconi MX8000 CT scanner. The early arterial phase (EAR), late arterial phase (LAP) and the portal venous phase (PVP) scans were started at 21 s, 34 s and 85 s respectively. The mean difference of CT values between tumor and liver parenchyma for each scanning phase was measured, and the sensitivity of detection of SHCC in each of these phases and in the combined phase was calculated and statistically analyzed. Results: The mean difference of CT values between tumor and liver parenchyma was significant in 71 lesions≥1 cm in three phases (P<0.05). In 91 tumor foci, the detectability of SHCC was 45.1 %, 83.5 % and 92.3 % in EAP, LAP and double arterial phases (DAP), respectively. The early arterial phase plus the portal venous phase and the double arterial phase plus the portal venous phase were 94.5 %, 97.8 %, respectively. Whereas the detectability in LAP plus PVP and in DAP plus PVP had no statistical difference. Conclusion: The utility of faster speed and thinner slice MDCT and multiphase scanning protocol can improve the detectability of hypervascular small hepatocellular carcinoma. Among which LAP is superior to EAP in depicting the lesions.

However, long-term storage and preservation of BMSCs for clinical use is still a great clinical challenge. The present study aimed to analyze the effect of long-term cryopreservation on the regenerative ability of BMSCs. After cryopreservation of BMSCs from beagle dogs for three years, cell viability, and quantitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, surface adherence, and mineralized nodule formation were analyzed. BMSCs in cell-scaffold complex were then implanted into nude mice. There was no significant difference in cell viability and ALP activity between osteogenic differentiation and non-osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and BMSCs in cell-scaffold complex retained osteogenic differentiation ability in vivo. These results indicate that long-term cryopreserved BMSCs maintain their have capacity to contribute to regeneration. © 2013 Zoological Society of Japan.

Methods: MRI data of 33 patients with malignant papillary lesions proved by pathology, including 19 cases of breast papillary carcinoma (16 cases of intraductal papillary carcinoma and 3 cases of encapsulated papillary carcinoma), 14 cases of intraductal papilloma with ductal carcinoma in situ were retrospectively reviewed referring to breast imaging reporting and data system and compared with those of 26 patients with atypical papillary lesions (intraductal papilloma with atypical hyperplasia). Results: The most common MRI findings of malignant papillary lesions were single lesion located in the retro-areolar region, isointensity on plain scan, rim-mass-enhancement on enhanced scan combined with ductal dilatation or not. The time-intensity curve appeared as type III in majority. There was statistical difference in the number of tumor, signal intensity on plain scan, enhancement pattern on enhanced scan and ductal dilatation between malignant papillary and atypical papillary lesions (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Breast MRI shows great advantage on finding of malignant papillary lesions. It can distinguish most of malignant papillary lesions from atypical papillary lesions.

84891899811	In-line phase contrast imaging of hepatic portal vein embolization with radiolucent embolic agents in mice: A preliminary study	It is crucial to understand the distribution of embolic agents inside target liver during and after the hepatic portal vein embolization (PVE) procedure. For a long time, the problem has not been well solved due to the radiolucency of embolic agents and the resolution limitation of conventional radiography. In this study, we first reported use of fluorescent carboxyl microspheres (FCM) as radiolucent embolic agents for embolizing hepatic portal veins. The fluorescent characteristic of FCM could help to determine their approximate location easily. Additionally, the microspheres were found to be fairly good embolizing agents for PVE. After the livers were excised and fixed, they were imaged by in-line phase contrast imaging (PCI), which greatly improved the detection of the radiolucent embolic agents as compared to absorption contrast imaging (ACI). The preliminary study has for the first time shown that PCI has great potential in the pre-clinical investigation of PVE with radiolucent embolic agents. © 2013 Tang et al.

84892920524	Periodontal regeneration and mesenchymal stem cells	The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is to regenerate periodontal supporting tissues, but this is hard to achieve as the results of periodontal techniques for regeneration are clinically unpredictable. Stem cells owing to their plasticity and proliferation potential provides a new paradigm for periodontal regeneration. Stem cells from mesenchyme can self renew and generate new dental tissues (including dentin and cementum), alveolar bone and periodontal ligament, and thus they have great potential in periodontal regeneration. This chapter presents an insight into mesenchymal stem cells and their potential use in periodontal regeneration. In this chapter the cellular and molecular biology in periodontal regeneration will be introduced, followed by a range of conventional surgical procedures for periodontal regeneration will be discussed. Mesenchymal stem cells applied in regenerated periodontal tissue and their biological characterizations in vitro will be also introduced. Lastly, the use of mesenchymal stem cell to repair periodontal tissues in large animal models will be also reviewed. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

84896112707	Association between postmenopausal osteoporosis and experimental periodontitis	To investigate the correlation between postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) and the pathogenesis of periodontitis, ovariectomized rats were generated and the experimental periodontitis was induced using a silk ligature. The inflammatory factors and bone metabolic markers were measured in the serum and periodontal tissues of ovariectomized rats using an automatic chemistry analyzer, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunohistochemistry. The bone mineral density of whole body, pelvis, and spine was analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and image analysis. All data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0 statistical software. It was found that ovariectomy could upregulate the expression of interleukin- (IL-)6, the receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and downregulate IL-10 expression in periodontal tissues, which resulted in progressive alveolar bone loss in experimental periodontitis. This study indicates that changes of cytokines and bone turnover markers in the periodontal tissues of ovariectomized rats contribute to the damage of periodontal tissues. © 2014 Kai Luo et al.

84896132694	Interleukin-10 inhibits bone resorption: A potential therapeutic strategy in periodontitis and other bone loss diseases	Periodontitis and other bone loss diseases, decreasing bone volume and strength, have a significant impact on millions of people with the risk of tooth loss and bone fracture. The integrity and strength of bone are maintained through the balance between bone resorption and bone formation by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively, so the loss of bone results from the disruption of such balance due to increased resorption or/and decreased formation of bone. The goal of therapies for diseases of bone loss is to reduce bone loss, improve bone formation, and then keep healthy bone density. Current therapies have mostly relied on long-term medication, exercise, anti-inflammatory therapies, and changing of the life style. However there are some limitations for some patients in the effective treatments for bone loss diseases because of the complexity of bone loss. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and recent studies have indicated that IL-10 can contribute to the maintenance of bone mass through inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption and regulation of osteoblastic bone formation. This paper will provide a brief overview of the role of IL-10 in bone loss diseases and discuss the possibility of IL-10 adoption in therapy of bone loss diseases therapy. © 2014 Qian Zhang et al.

84897378658	Diffusion-weighted imaging in assessing renal pathology of chronic kidney disease: A preliminary clinical study	Objective To investigate the clinical potential of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in assessing renal pathology of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods Seventy-one CKD patients and twelve healthy volunteers were examined using DWI with prospective acquisition correction. Renal biopsy specimens from the CKD patients were scored based on the severity of renal pathology and to confirm pathology type. CKD patients were divided into three groups according to pathology scores: mild, moderate, or severe. The association between renal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and pathology scores was investigated using Pearson's correlation and single factor analysis of variance. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore associations between renal ADC values and pathology score, glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine, and age. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was conducted to compare ADC values and pathology type. Results Renal ADC values correlated negatively with pathology scores (r = -0.633, P < 0.001). The ADC values among the four groups (mild, moderate, severe impairment, and controls) were significantly different (F = 19.512, P < 0.001).

Methods: MSCT features of 10 patients with NF-CNETP proved by pathology were retrospectively reviewed and compared with pathological results. Results: Among 10 patients, 5 tumors located in pancreatic head, 4 in the tail, and 1 in both pancreatic body and tail. The tumor size ranged from 2.5 cm to 6.2 cm. All tumors had well-defined contours, and 9 tumors showed complete capsules. On plain CT, the lesions showed heterogeneous density with slightly low density or isodensity of solid cyst wall. Calcifications were found in 2 cases. On enhanced CT, 9 tumors showed markedly ringed enhancement in arterial phase (AP), and the other 1 manifested enhanced mural nodule. All lesions showed continuous enhancement in portal venous phase (PP). CT value of cyst wall was (128.00±62.62) HU in AP and (132.40±44.66) HU in PP. Pancreatic duct in 4 patients had slight dilatation, and Imetastasis of peripancreatic lymph nodes was found. In 6 patients who underwent dual energy CT spectral imaging, iodine concentrations (IC) of lesions were measured and normalized to abdominal aorta to obtain normalized IC (nIC). The nIC values were 0.40±0.16 in AP and 0.79±0.22 in PP. Conclusion: The enhancement pattern and appearance of capsule for NF-CNETP in MSCT play an important role in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of NF-CNETP.

84902213469	Differentiation of Crohn's disease from intestinal tuberculosis by clinical and ct enterographic models	Background: Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) have similar clinical, radiological, and endoscopic features. The objective of our study was to investigate the values of clinical features and computed tomographic (CT) enterographic manifestations in the differential diagnosis between CD and ITB. Methods: Clinical features and CT enterographic manifestations in a cohort of 141 patients with CD and 47 patients with ITB were reviewed retrospectively. Parameters were screened by logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the diagnostic efficacy of screened parameters was analyzed by regression equation (mathematical model) and receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The clinical features indicative of CD were hematochezia and perianal disease; features indicative of ITB include positive purified protein derivative skin test, occurrence of ascites, pulmonary tuberculosis, and night sweats. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of regression mathematical model established by clinical features were 94.3, 80.4, 91.0, 93.7, and 82.6%, respectively. CT enterographic manifestations indicative of CD were the involvement of the left colon, asymmetric pattern of involvement and abscess, comb sign; manifestations indicative ITB were the distribution of the lymph nodes along the right colic artery, contracture of ileocecal valve, fixed patulous ileocecal valve and lymph nodes with central necrosis The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of regression mathematical model established by CT enterographic parameters were 96.5, 93.6, 95.7, 97.8, and 89.8%, respectively. Conclusions: The accuracy of CT enterographic model suggests the possibility of using CT enterography as an alternative to endoscopy in the differentiation between CD and ITB.

84903716067	Hyperlipidemia causes changes in inflammatory responses by periodontal pathogen challenge: Implications in acute and chronic infections	Objective In this study, the effect of hyperlipidemia on immune responses to periodontal bacterial infections was investigated. Methods Sixty male New Zealand white rabbits were equally assigned to normal diet (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks. Every six rabbits with ND or HFD were orally inoculated with live Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis three times a week for 8 weeks. Also every six rabbits with ND or HFD rabbits were injected intravenously with A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis LPS. Periodontal disease severity was quantified by macroscopic and radiographical evaluation. Serum cytokines were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vitro, peripheral mononuclear cells were collected and stimulated with LPS. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the changes in gene expression of macrophages. Results In the early stages of infection, HFD rabbits were exposed to oral infection and systemic infection developed a weak inflammatory response to the reduced cytokine expression compared with ND rabbits. However, HFD rabbits exhibited higher inflammatory cytokine expression during long-term infections. Moreover, the pronounced changes in inflammatory cytokine expression elicited a significantly increase in bone loss in HFD rabbits with oral infection. Peripheral macrophages harvested from HFD rabbits and exposed to LPS exhibited reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared with those from ND rabbits in vitro. Conclusion These data indicated that hyperlipidemia interfered with immune responses differently. The mechanism is possibly associated with immune paralysis in the acute phase and accumulation of inflammatory mediators in the chronic period. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84903479538	CT of the pancreas: Comparison of image quality and pancreatic duct depiction among model-based iterative, adaptive statistical iterative, and filtered back projection reconstruction techniques	The purpose of this study is to compare CT images of the pancreas reconstructed with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR), and filtered back projection (FBP) techniques for image quality and pancreatic duct (PD) depiction. Data from 40 patients with contrast-enhanced abdominal CT [CTDIvol: 10.3 ± 3.0 (mGy)] during the late arterial phase were reconstructed with FBP, 40% ASiR-FBP blending, and MBIR. Two radiologists assessed the depiction of the main PD, image noise, and overall image quality using 5-point scale independently. Objective CT value and noise were measured in the pancreatic parenchyma, and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the PD was calculated. The Friedman test and post-hoc multiple comparisons with Bonferroni test following one-way ANOVA were used for qualitative and quantitative assessment, respectively. For the subjective assessment, scores for MBIR were significantly higher than those for FBP and 40% ASiR (all P < 0.001). No significant differences in CT values of the pancreatic parenchyma were noted among FBP, 40% ASiR, and MBIR images (P > 0.05). Objective image noise was significantly lower and CNR of the PD was higher with MBIR than with FBP and 40% ASiR (all P < 0.05). Our results suggest that pancreatic CT images reconstructed with MBIR have lower image noise, better image quality, and higher conspicuity and CNR of the PD compared with FBP and ASiR. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

Methods: A total of 74 patients underwent gastric DECT. The mean CT values, length, image quality and effective radiation doses for VNE and TNE images were compared. Results: There was no statistical difference in maximal thickness of gastric tumors and maximal diameter of enlarged lymph nodes among the TNE and VNE images (P>0.05). The mean CT value differences between TNE and VNE were statistically significant for all tissue types, except for aorta attenuation measurements (P<0.05), but the absolute differences were under 10 HU. Lower noise was found for VNE images than TNE images (P<0.01). Image quality of VNE was diagnostic but lower than that of TNE (P<0.01). The dose reduction achieved by omitting the TNE acquisition was 21.40±4.44%. Conclusion: VNE scan may potentially replace TNE as part of a multi-phase gastric preoperative staging imaging protocol with consequent saving in radiation dose.

84913552611	Rosiglitazone impedes Porphyromonas gingivalis-accelerated atherosclerosis by downregulating the TLR/NF-κB signaling pathway in atherosclerotic mice	Porphyromonas gingivalis,a predominant periodontal pathogen, is known to accelerate atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic animals via aberrant inflammatory responses. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential protective role of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone in pathogen accelerated atherosclerosis in an apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse model. ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were inoculated intravenously with live P. gingivalis (strain 33277) or the buffer vehicle and treated with rosiglitazone or saline over a 10-week period. Their atherosclerotic status in aortic artery was assessed through histomorphometric analysis, inflammatory agent and lipid profiles in blood was determined by ELISA, and levels of relevant cytokines and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in aortic tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. P. gingivalis inoculation was associated with increased atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aorta and higher levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-1β), but the serum lipid profile was not affected by P. gingivalis infection. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and TLRs were higher in the aortic tissues of mice exposed to P. gingivalis, and activation of nuclear factor-κB was also observed. In both P. gingivalis-treated and -untreated ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, rosiglitazone treatment was associated with less atherosclerotic plaque formation; lower serum inflammatory cytokines, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol; higher levels of PPARγ, lower amounts of TLR2/4 and downregulated nuclear factor-κB activity in aortic tissues. These findings suggest that rosiglitazone mitigates or prevents P. gingivalis-accelerated atherosclerosis by inhibiting the inflammatory response via downregulation of the TLR/ nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway.

0346753766	MRI Diagnosis of Hepatic Focal Nodular Hyperplasia	Purpose: To analyze and evaluate MRI findings of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia(FNH). Methods: The unenhanced and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR images of 30 FNHs from 24 patients proven by pathology were analyzed retrospectively. Four of 24 patients also undertook MRI with liver-specific contrast agents, which was Mn-DPDP in 2 cases and SPIO in another 2 cases. Results: FNH was solitary in 22 cases and multiple in 2 cases. Its size varied from 1.0-6.0 cm. On T1WI, 24 lesions demonstra-ted typical isointensity or slightly hypointensity. Four lesions were hypointense. And 2 lesions presented slightly hyperintensity. On T2WI, 25 lesions appeared typical isointensity or slightly hyperintensity. And 5 were hyperintense. Twenty-nine FNHs were markedly hyperintense in the arterial phase of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and iso - or slightly hyperintense in the portal and delayed phases. One FNH did not enhance in the arterial phase but turned into isointensity in the delayed phase. Two FNHs were found surrounded by enhanced pseudocapsule in the delayed phases. The scars were shown by both unenhanced and enhanced MRI in 21 lesions, but were not visualized in the remaining 9 lesions. They were hypo - or isointense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI. The scars showed gradual enhancement, which becanme iso - or hyperintense on delayed images. In 4 patients, feeding arteries were depicted in the arterial phase. On MRI images enhanced with Mn-DPDP, FNH was isointense or slightly hyperintense. On SPIO-enhanced images FNH was isointense to the liver. Conclusions: In most cases, FNH has typical MRI manifestations. The combined analysis of unenhanced and enhanced MRI is the key to correct diagnosis. Liver-specific contrast agents are helpful.
