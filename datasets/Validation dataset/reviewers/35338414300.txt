2042510343	An image scrambling algorithm based on wavelet transform and Knight's tour	Image secure transmission is one of the main research issues in the field of network communications. Many typical image encryption techniques take the direct way of scrambling the transmitted image itself, which may limit the scrambling effect that is achievable. A new image encryption algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm uses various knight-tours on the chessboard as the basic tool for image scrambling, and scrambles the wavelet coefficients of the transmitted image instead of the image itself. Experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve better scrambling effect. Some useful conclusions are obtained through the analysis and explanation of the experimental data, which lay a solid foundation for further research.

18544375756	Robust exponential stability and domains of attraction in a class of interval neural networks	This paper addresses robust exponential stability as well as domains of attraction in a class of interval neural networks. A sufficient condition for an equilibrium point to be exponentially stable is established. And an estimate on the domains of attraction of exponentially stable equilibrium points is presented. Both the condition and the estimate are formulated in terms of the parameter intervals, the neurons' activation functions and the equilibrium point. Hence, they are easily checkable. In addition, our results neither depend on monotonicity of the activation functions nor on coupling conditions between the neurons. Consequently, these results are of practical importance in evaluating the performance of interval associative memory networks. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33645157934	Video compression scheme with resolution scalability and low computation power	This paper presents a video compression scheme with resolution scalability and low computation power for portable devices such as PDA and mobile phone. It includes two stages: (1) the wavelet coefficients in a frame are quantized by the threshold formed by the eye's sensitivity to their subband. (2) to the low frequence subband, the differences between wavelet coefficients and their prediction values formed by the neighbor coefficients are encoded by the Huffman encoder, and, to the high frequence subbands, the run lengths of wavelet coefficients and their values are also encoded by Huffman encoder. Moreover, statistical frequencies of symbols used by Huffman encoder is resulted from the previous frame. Experimental results show that the scheme not only achieves compression ratio similar to MJPEG2000, but also costs less time than MJPEG2000.

33645212865	Pancyclicity of Möbius cubes with faulty nodes	An interconnection network with n nodes is four-pancyclic if it contains a cycle of length l for each integer l with 4≤l≤n. An interconnection network is fault-tolerant four-pancyclic if the surviving network is four-pancyclic in the presence of faults. The fault-tolerant four-pancyclicity of interconnection networks is a desired property because many classical parallel algorithms can be mapped onto such networks in a communication-efficient fashion, even in the presence of failing nodes or edges. Due to some attractive properties as compared with its hypercube counterpart of the same size, the Möbius cube has been proposed as a promising candidate for interconnection topology. Hsieh and Chen [S.Y. Hsieh, C.H. Chen, Pancyclicity on Möbius cubes with maximal edge faults, Parallel Computing, 30(3) (2004) 407-421.] showed that an n-dimensional Möbius cube is four-pancyclic in the presence of up to n-2 faulty edges. In this paper, we show that an n-dimensional Möbius cube is four-pancyclic in the presence of up to n-2 faulty nodes. The obtained result is optimal in that, if n-1 nodes are removed, the surviving network may not be four-pancyclic. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The generalized cubes include the hypercube and most hypercube variants as special cases. In this paper, we present a lower bound on the size of a k-neighborhood in n-dimensional generalized cubes, where 2n + 1 ≤ k ≤ 3n - 2. This lower bound is tight in that it is met by the n-dimensional hypercube. Our result is an extension of two previously known results. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33846579698	A (4n - 9)/3 diagnosis algorithm on n-dimensional cube network	As a generalization of the precise and pessimistic diagnosis strategies of system-level diagnosis of multicomputers, the t/k diagnosis strategy can significantly improve the self-diagnosing capability of a system at the expense of no more than k fault-free processors (nodes) being mistakenly diagnosed as faulty. In the case k ≥ 2, to our knowledge, there is no known t/k diagnosis algorithm for general diagnosable system or for any specific system. Hypercube is a popular topology for interconnecting processors of multicomputers. It is known that an n-dimensional cube is (4n - 9)/3-diagnosable. This paper addresses the (4n - 9)/3 diagnosis of n-dimensional cube. By exploring the relationship between a largest connected component of the 0-test subgraph of a faulty hypercube and the distribution of the faulty nodes over the network, the fault diagnosis of an n-dimensional cube can be reduced to those of two constituent (n - 1)-dimensional cubes. On this basis, a diagnosis algorithm is presented. Given that there are no more than 4n - 9 faulty nodes, this algorithm can isolate all faulty nodes to within a set in which at most three nodes are fault-free. The proposed algorithm can operate in O(N log

34249660580	A transplantable compensation scheme for the effect of the radiance from the interior of a camera on the accuracy of temperature measurement	Radiance coming from the interior of an uncooled infrared camera has a significant effect on the measured value of the temperature of the object. This paper presents a three-phase compensation scheme for coping with this effect. The first phase acquires the calibration data and forms the calibration function by least square fitting. Likewise, the second phase obtains the compensation data and builds the compensation function by fitting. With the aid of these functions, the third phase determines the temperature of the object in concern from any given ambient temperature. It is known that acquiring the compensation data of a camera is very time-consuming. For the purpose of getting the compensation data at a reasonable time cost, we propose a transplantable scheme. The idea of this scheme is to calculate the ratio between the central pixel's responsivity of the child camera to the radiance from the interior and that of the mother camera, followed by determining the compensation data of the child camera using this ratio and the compensation data of the mother camera Experimental results show that either of the child camera and the mother camera can measure the temperature of the object with an error of no more than 2°C. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

34548304817	An efficient genetic algorithm for system-level diagnosis	Elhadef and Ayeb devised a genetic algorithm for the system-level diagnosis of multi-computers, where the fitness function is calculated by comparing the given syndrome with the syndrome randomly produced by the current guess fault set. One demerit of this algorithm is that this fitness function takes only one syndrome from many possible candidates, leading to a high probability of incorrect diagnosis. In the present paper, the authors describe a set of equations that govern the statuses of the units in a system. Based on this, the authors present a new genetic algorithm for the fault diagnosis of diagnosable systems by designing a novel fitness function. Theoretical analysis and simulation result both show that the algorithm is remarkably superior to the Elhadef-Ayeb's diagnosis algorithm in terms of the number of iterations. The initial population production process proposed by Elhadef and Ayeb is also justified.

59549099410	Acoustic image processing based on correlation of wavelet coefficient and fuzzy theory	Sonar images are usually highly corrupted by reverberations caused by the complex generation mechanism. In order to prepare the image for further segmentation, recognition or other processing, certain suppression and enhancement should be applied in advance. A wavelet domain solution combined with spatial correlation and fuzzy logic method for reverberation suppression and contrast enhancement was proposed. This algorithm adopts a new local correlation coefficient matrix considering local property in the next scale, which increased the ability of edge detection. Meanwhile, a fuzzy theory based algorithm was used to enhance the useful information in sonar images. Experiments show that this method significantly decreases the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), while increase the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Compared with other methods, this method is suitable for sonar image pre-processing.

This paper is concerned with the problem of embedding meshes/tori in faulty crossed cubes. We reduce this mesh/tori embedding problem to the problem of embedding paths/cycles in faulty crossed cubes. Then, by exploiting the fault-tolerant pancyclicity of crossed cubes of lower dimension, several schemes for embedding 2D or 3D meshes/tori in faulty crossed cubes are proposed. All of these embeddings have small dilations and small congestions. The obtained results show that the parallel algorithms with mesh/torus task graphs can be efficiently executed on faulty crossed cubes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

43349105612	A method for removing the effect of the camera radiance on the infrared image	The radiance coming from the interior of an uncooled infrared camera has significant effect on the quality of an infrared image. The classical two-point-correction (TPC) method fails to remove this effect where no TPC data is collected. To overcome this deficit, this paper presents a three-phase scheme. First, from a set of samples and through least squares fitting, how the TPC datum varies with the interior temperature of the camera is determined. On this basis, all the necessary TPC data are calculated. Finally, the collected infrared image is corrected with the TPC method. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that, for a proper interior temperature of the camera, the scheme can remove the effect effectively. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The proposed watermarking algorithm scrambles the binary image watermark that may protect copyright and embeds it into the low frequency wavelet coefficients of the host image. The human visual system (HVS) characteristics are taken into consideration during the watermark embedding process so as to keep the watermark invisible. Then an RBF neural network is used to learn the characteristics of the embedded watermark related to the watermarked image. With the aid of the learning and adaptive capabilities of neural networks, the trained neural network can exactly recover the watermark from the watermarked image. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a good imperceptibility and high robustness to various common image processing attacks.

Star graphs are recognized as promising candidates for interconnection networks. This article addresses the size of a largest connected component of a faulty star graph. We prove that, in an n-star graph (n3) with up to 2n-4 faulty vertices, all fault-free vertices but at most two form a connected component. Moreover, all fault-free vertices but exactly two form a connected component if and only if the set of all faulty vertices is equal to the neighbourhood of a pair of fault-free adjacent vertices. These results show that star graphs exhibit excellent fault-tolerant abilities in the sense that there exists a large functional network in a faulty star graph.

Theoretical analysis of this model indicates that (1) there is a unique (viral) equilibrium, and (2) this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Further study shows that, by taking active measures, the percentage of infected computers can be made below an acceptable threshold value. Copyright © 2012 Lu-Xing Yang and Xiaofan Yang.

84864943499	Propagation of computer virus under human intervention: A dynamical model	This paper examines the propagation behavior of computer virus under human intervention. A dynamical model describing the spread of computer virus, under which a susceptible computer can become recovered directly and an infected computer can become susceptible directly, is proposed. Through a qualitative analysis of this model, it is found that the virus-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number R 0 ≤ 1, whereas the viral equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 1. Based on these results and a parameter analysis, some appropriate measures for eradicating the spread of computer virus across the Internet are recommended. Copyright © 2012 Chenquan Gan et al.

84865822190	A novel fault tolerance measure of interconnection multiprocessor systems	Certain nodes cannot be faulty at the same time which can better reflect fault patterns in a real system than the existing ones. The determination of the size of a g-neighborhoods (i. e., a neighborhood of a set of g nodes) in a given graph is essential to analyze the fault tolerance of multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we present a novel fault tolerance measure for hypermesh based on the conditional components, proving the bounds of the neighborhoods of the conditional components and the other results related to fault tolerance. Our study results show that the originally corresponding results tend to underestimate resilience of interconnection multiprocessor systems. © 2012 Binary Information Press.

84866081677	Fixation probabilities on complete star and bipartite digraphs	This paper exactly formulates the k th-order fixation probabilities on complete star digraphs (CSDs), which extend the results from Broom and Rychtá (2008). By applying these probability formulae, some asymptotic properties on CBDs are analyzed, and certain CSDs are determined to be amplifiers of selection for arbitrary relative fitness larger than 1, while all the CSDs are proved to be amplifiers of selection for fixed relative fitness slightly larger than 1. A numerical method for fixed population structure (by solving a linear system) is developed to calculate the fixation probabilities on complete bipartite digraphs (CBDs), and some conjectures are finally given through simulations. © 2012 Chunming Zhang et al.

84870050364	Towards the epidemiological modeling of computer viruses	Epidemic dynamics of computer viruses is an emerging discipline aiming to understand the way that computer viruses spread on networks. This paper is intended to establish a series of rational epidemic models of computer viruses. First, a close inspection of some common characteristics shared by all typical computer viruses clearly reveals the flaws of previous models. Then, a generic epidemic model of viruses, which is named as the SLBS model, is proposed. Finally, diverse generalizations of the SLBS model are suggested. We believe this work opens a door to the full understanding of how computer viruses prevail on the Internet. Copyright © 2012 Xiaofan Yang and Lu-Xing Yang.

84870066991	The spread of computer viruses under the influence of removable storage devices	Removable storage devices provide a way other than the Internet for the spread of computer viruses. However, nearly all previous epidemiological models of viruses considered only the Internet route of spread of viruses, neglecting the removable device route at all. In this paper, a new spread model of viruses, which incorporates the effect of removable devices, is suggested. Different from previous models, the epidemic threshold for this model vanishes. Moreover, the model admits a unique virose equilibrium, which is shown to be globally asymptotically stable. This result implies that any effort in eradicating viruses cannot succeed. By analyzing the respective influences of system parameters, a number of policies are recommended so as to restrict the density of infected computers to below an acceptable threshold. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84873181866	A four-compartment computer virus propagation model with graded infection rate	A new resident virus propagation model with graded infection rate is established based on the properties of two important stages undergoing by resident virus, which are the latent phase, in which resident virus cannot infect other hosts because it has not yet been loaded into memory and the active phase, in which resident virus resides in memory and infects any suitable program that is executed on the computer. Two computer compartments with different infection rate are established. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviors of this model are investigated by stability theory and numerical simulations. It is found that the dynamical properties of this model are determined by basic reproductive rate. Specifically, virus-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproductive rate is less than or equal to one , whereas the local asymptotical stability of the viral equilibrium is guaranteed if basic reproductive rate is bigger than one, followed by a conjecture on its global stability. Then the sensitivity analysis of basic reproductive rate to the system parameters is investigated and a collection of policies is advised to control the spread of computer virus over the Internet.

84876152319	Epidemics of computer viruses: A complex-network approach	This paper addresses the spreading behavior of computer viruses across the Internet. Taking into account the power-law degree distribution of the Internet, a novel epidemic model of computer viruses is proposed. The spreading threshold for the model is presented. The global asymptotic stability of the virus-free equilibrium is proved when the threshold is below the unity, whereas the permanence of the virose equilibrium is shown if the threshold exceeds the unity. The influences of different model parameters as well as the network topology on virus spreading are also analyzed. In particular, it is found that (1) a higher network heterogeneity is conducive to the diffusion of computer viruses, and (2) a scale-free network with lower power-law exponent benefits virus spreading. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Different from all the previous models, this model regards the external computers as a single compartment to study. Through a qualitative analysis, it is found that (1) this model possesses a unique (viral) equilibrium, and (2) this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.

By incorporating a vaccination probability in the SIRS model with generalized nonlinear incidence rate, a novel epidemic model of computer viruses is established. A thorough analysis of this model shows that, depending on the value of the basic reproduction number, either the virus-free equilibrium or the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Simulation results not only justify the proposed model, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination.

84885071747	The effect of infected external computers on the spread of viruses: A compartment modeling study	Inevitably, there exist infected computers outside of the Internet. This paper aims to understand how infected external computers affect the spread of computer viruses. For that purpose, a new virus-antivirus spreading model, which takes into account the effect of infected/immune external computers, is established. A systematic study shows that, unlike most previous models, the proposed model admits no virus-free equilibrium and admits a globally asymptotically stable viral equilibrium. This result implies that it would be practically impossible to eradicate viruses on the Internet. As a result, inhibiting the virus prevalence to below an acceptable level would be the next best thing. A theoretical study reveals the effect of different parameters on the steady virus prevalence. On this basis, a number of suggestions are made so as to contain virus spreading. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84890549801	The spread of computer viruses over a reduced scale-free network	Due to the high dimensionality of an epidemic model of computer viruses over a general scale-free network, it is difficult to make a close study of its dynamics. In particular, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prove the global stability of its viral equilibrium, if any. To overcome this difficulty, we suggest to simplify a general scale-free network by partitioning all of its nodes into two classes: higher-degree nodes and lower-degree nodes, and then equating the degrees of all higher-degree nodes and all lower-degree nodes, respectively, yielding a reduced scale-free network. We then propose an epidemic model of computer viruses over a reduced scale-free network. A theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed model is bound to have a globally stable viral equilibrium, implying that any attempt to eradicate network viruses would prove unavailing. As a result, the next best thing we can do is to restrain virus prevalence. Based on an analysis of the impact of different model parameters on virus prevalence, some practicable measures are recommended to contain virus spreading. The work in this paper adequately justifies the idea of reduced scale-free networks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84891043703	Part-metric and its applications in discrete systems	This paper applies the part-metric method to study some types of higher-order symmetric difference equations with several different exponential parameters. These difference equations are proved to have unique equilibria and some useful inequalities regarding the difference equation functions are formulated. By use of the part-metric and a result given by Kruse and Nesemann (1999) [8], some sufficient conditions on the parameters are given to guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the equilibria. Furthermore, by the part-metric defined on matrices, this approach is also applicable to show the global asymptotic stability of some cyclic discrete dynamic systems. The results of this paper are considered a big improvement over many existing results found in the literature. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84890792953	A new epidemic model of computer viruses	This paper addresses the epidemiological modeling of computer viruses. By incorporating the effect of removable storage media, considering the possibility of connecting infected computers to the Internet, and removing the conservative restriction on the total number of computers connected to the Internet, a new epidemic model is proposed. Unlike most previous models, the proposed model has no virus-free equilibrium and has a unique endemic equilibrium. With the aid of the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems as well as the generalized Poincare-Bendixson theorem, the endemic equilibrium is shown to be globally asymptotically stable. By analyzing the influence of different system parameters on the steady number of infected computers, a collection of policies is recommended to prohibit the virus prevalence. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For either of these two communication patterns, a routing scheme is suggested, and the corresponding wavelength assignment strategy is presented. For the bidirectional communication, the number of wavelengths required by the proposed embedding scheme is shown to attain the minimum. We conjecture that the congestion of the embedding Qn3 in C3

84899622420	The pulse treatment of computer viruses: A modeling study	Unlike new medical procedures, new antivirus software can be disseminated rapidly through the Internet and takes effect immediately after it is run. As a result, a considerable number of infected computers can be cured almost simultaneously. Consequently, it is of practical importance to understand how pulse treatment affects the spread of computer viruses. For this purpose, an impulsive malware propagation model is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer virus model that takes into account the effect of pulse treatment. The dynamic properties of this model are investigated comprehensively. Specifically, it is found that (a) the virus-free periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction ratio (BRR) is less than unity, (b) infections are permanent when the BRR exceeds unity, and (c) a locally asymptotically stable viral periodic solution bifurcates from the virus-free periodic solution when the BRR goes through unity. A close inspection of the influence of different model parameters on the BRR allows us to suggest some feasible measures of eradicating electronic infections. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84904201059	Global stability of a computer virus propagation model with two kinds of generic nonlinear probabilities	Vaccination is one of the most effective measures for suppressing the spread of computer virus, and the bilinear incidence rate assumption for the majority of previous models, which is a good first approximation of the general incidence rate, is in disagreement with the reality. In this paper, a new dynamical model with two kinds of generic nonlinear probabilities (incidence rate and vaccination probability) is established. An exhaustive mathematical analysis of this model shows that (a) there are two equilibria, virus-free equilibrium and viral equilibrium, and (b) the virus-free (or viral) equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less (or greater) than unity. The analysis of the basic reproduction number is also included. Additionally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the main results, from which it can be seen that the generic nonlinear vaccination is helpful to strengthen computer security. © 2014 Chenquan Gan et al.

1242329928	The Diameter of Honeycomb Rhombic Tori	The effectiveness of an interconnection network is one of the dominating performance factors for the associated parallel computers. Honeycomb rhombic torus networks are attractive alternatives to torus networks due to the smaller node degree, leading to lower complexity and lower implementation cost. Diameter of an interconnection network is one of the most important evaluation indexes because it characterizes the maximum communication delay in the network. In this paper, the diameter of a honeycomb rhombic torus is determined, which is lower than that of a torus of the same order. Therefore, the superiority of honeycomb rhombic torus networks is greatly strengthened. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
