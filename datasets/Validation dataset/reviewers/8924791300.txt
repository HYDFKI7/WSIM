25844507791	Phototoxicity of Hemoporfin to ovarian cancer	Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (Hemoporfin) is a novel porphyrin-related photosensitizer. Photocytotoxic effect of Hemoporfin to ovarian cancer is still unclear. We used human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 and its xenograft model in nude mice to investigate the Hemoporfin-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) for ovarian cancer. The growth rates of SKOV3 cells were determined by MTT assays. Flow cytometry combined with dual Annexin V/PI staining was used to identify the death mode of the cells following PDT. We demonstrated that Hemoprofin-based PDT induced significant cell death via direct necrosis induction, and the photocytotoxity to SKOV3 cells is dose related. With SKOV3 xenograft model in nude mouse, we further demonstrated that Hemoporfin-based PDT is effective for controlling the tumor growth. Our results suggest that Hemoporfin is a promising novel photosensitizer for the treatment of ovarian cancer and merit further evaluation in the clinical practice. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

30544442386	Hypoxia inhibits the migratory capacity of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells	Hypoxia, a prominent characteristic of inflammatory tissue lesions and solid tumour microenvironments, is a crucial stimulus capable of modulating the expression of specific genes involved in leucocyte recruitment. Although studies have shown that hypoxia can affect leucocyte migration by influencing the expression of migration-related genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their endogenous tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP), it remains unclear whether hypoxia can affect the migration of dendritic cells (DC). In this study, we showed that human monocyte-derived DC under hypoxic conditions in a transwell system have significantly reduced migratory capacity compared to normoxic controls. A moderate phenotypic change of hypoxic DC was observed. In hypoxic DC, we detected a twofold increase in TIMP-1 transcript levels, and downregulated expression of MMP-9 and membrane type 1-MMP genes by threefold and 17-fold, respectively. Our results suggest that hypoxia may inhibit DC migratory activity by regulating the balance between MMP and TIMP gene expression. © 2005 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

33645340860	Procaspase-3 enhances the in vitro effect of cytosine deaminase-thymidine kinase disuicide gene therapy on human ovarian cancer	Because the efficacy of genetic prodrug activation therapy (GPAT) using herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk)/ganciclovir (GCV) or Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (cd)/5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) is not satisfied in early clinical trials and the mechanism of both the GPATs have been shown to lead to the activation of cell apoptotic pathway, we hypothesized that coexpression of procaspase-3, a central downstream executioner of apoptotic pathways, with cd-tk gene leads to enhanced cell death in ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Following transfection with the vectors encoding cd and tk, 5-FC and GCV treatments lead to greater cell death in procaspase-3-expressing clones of 3AO (3AO-caspase-3) than control cells (3AO-pcDNA3), as well as more rapid activation of caspase-3 and more rapid cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). There is a greater degree of cell apoptotic rate in the procaspase-3-expressing clones than in control cells following the treatment with cd-tk/5-FC + GCV, and apoptosis is the main cell death form. None of these effects is seen following transfection with a control vector that does not encode tk and cd (pBTdel-279). The results strongly suggest that coexpression of procaspase-3 may lead to a significant enhancement of the efficacy of cd-tk/5-FC + GCV, and this strategy would be a novel and promising approach for the treatment of ovarian cancer. © 2006, IGCS.

33744915787	Biomarker discovery for ovarian cancer using SELDI-TOF-MS	Objectives.: The purpose of this study is to discover potential biomarkers for the detection and monitoring of adjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Methods.: Serum samples from ovarian cancers and non-cancer controls were analyzed using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). To discover the possible diagnostic biomarker for ovarian cancer, a preliminary training set of spectra derived from 31 primary ovarian cancer patients, 16 patients with benign ovarian diseases, and 25 healthy women was used to develop a proteomic model that discriminated cancer from non-cancer effectively. A blind test set, including 43 new cases, was used to validate the sensitivity and specificity of this multivariate model. To explore treatment-induced serum protein change, the protein profiles generated from 16 postoperative patients before chemotherapy are compared with those obtained after chemotherapy. Results.: A Four-peak model was established in the training set that discriminated cancer from non-cancer with sensitivity of 90.8% and specificity of 93.5%. A sensitivity of 87.0% and a specificity of 95.0% for the blind test were obtained, compared with 60.7%, 55% for CA125 for the same samples. These 4 markers performed significantly better than the current standard marker, CA125 (P < 0.05). One protein peak (mass/charge ratio [m/z], 4475) was identified in 12 of 16 (75%) postoperative patients after chemotherapy, but was absent before chemotherapy. Conclusion.: The proteins represented by these peaks are candidate biomarkers for ovarian cancer diagnosis and/or monitoring treatment response. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33750466237	Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase is involved in the migration of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells	Dendritic cells (DC) are highly mobile APC. The trafficking of both immature and mature DC is crucial for their functions, which depends mainly on chemotactic attraction and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activity. MMP that are in a transmembrane form belong to membrane type (MT)-MMP, among which MT1-MMP has been shown to possess strong proteolytic activity that is capable of degrading extracellular matrix molecules. Although it is well established that MMP are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that collectively degrade most components of the extracellular matrix, relatively little is known about MT-MMP-mediated matrix degradation during DC migration. In this study, we showed that MT1-MMP was expressed in human monocyte-derived immature and mature DC by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blotting analyses. Moreover, immunofluorescence microscopic studies showed that MT1-MMP was expressed on the membrane surface of DC. Blocking of MT1-MMP activity greatly reduced the invasion capacity of immature DC in Matrigel, whereas mature DC mobility was not affected. Taken together, our results show a novel functional link between MT1-MMP and DC motility and suggest that MT1-MMP may play an important role in modulating the migration of immature DC. © 2006 The Authors.

33846888608	Establishment of serum protein pattern for screening colorectal cancer using SELDI-TOF-MS	Aim: The purpose of this study is to develop a proteomic pattern for distinguishing individuals with colorectal cancer from healthy controls and monitoring micrometastasis using SELDI-TOF-MS. Methods: A training set consisting of 63 patients with colorectal cancer, 20 patients with benign colorectal diseases and 26 healthy volunteers was used to develop a proteomic model that discriminated colorectal cancer effectively. The sensitivity and specificity of this model was validated by an independent test set. To explore serum proteins changed after operation, the protein profiles of 31 postoperative patients were compared with those of preoperative patients. We also analyzed protein profiles of patients with and without metastasis to monitor micrometastasis. Results: Our study yielded a four-peak model (m/z: 3191.5, 3262.9, 3396.3 and 5334.4) that discriminated cancer from non-cancer samples with sensitivity of 90.3% and specificity of 95.7%. This model was validated in the test set with sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 93.8% which was significantly better than the combination use of CEA, CA199 and CA242 (sensitivity 62.4%) for early detection of colorectal cancer. Two peaks (m/z: 2753.8 and 4172.4) were found down-regulated in postoperative samples comparing with preoperative samples. We also detected two proteins (m/z: 9184.4 and 9340.9) that can discriminate patients with primary colorectal cancer from metastatic colorectal cancer. Conclusions: The four-peak model and two peaks (m/z: 2753.8 and 4172.4) detected in this study have the potential for assistance in diagnostics and therapeutic strategies in colorectal cancer and the two proteins (m/z: 9184.4 and 9340.9) were effective biomarkers for monitoring micrometastasis.

36448980672	Effects of water-deficit stress on the transcriptomes of developing immature ear and tassel in maize	Water-deficit stress during meiosis is one of the most serious threats to crop production. To elucidate the mechanisms of the response to water-deficit stress in the reproductive organs of maize, we have characterized the changes in transcription that occur during meiosis in the tassels and floret formation in the ears following water deficit stress. We used oligo microarray analysis, which included 57,452 transcripts representing more than 30,000 identifiable unique maize genes, and combined this with reverse Northern blot analysis. After 7 days of stress, immature tassels and ears differed considerably in their transcriptional responses, and the majority of changes were organ specific. In the tassels, 1,513 transcripts were differentially expressed (by threefold or greater) with 62% of these being upregulated by water stress. In the ears, 202 transcripts were differentially expressed with 95% being upregulated by water stress. Most of these transcripts have not been previously reported to be associated with water stress. Only 74 of these transcripts were co-regulated in the two organs. The stress-regulated transcripts are involved in a broad range of cellular and biochemical activities. The most notable may function in carbohydrate metabolism, particular in sucrose, trehalose and raffinose metabolism, and in cell wall metabolism in the tassels. Collectively, these data suggest that the transcripts differentially expressed during reproductive organic development may represent candidate genes for dissecting molecular mechanism of this important biological process in response to water-deficit stress. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

35448991307	A study on notch signaling in human breast cancer	Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women. The Notch family of proteins plays crucial roles in determining cell fates such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. A role for Notch signaling in human breast cancer has been suggested by the development of adenocarcinomas in the murine mammary gland. However, it is not clear currently whether Notch signaling is frequently expressed and activated in breast cancers. Here we show that Notch signaling is overexpressed and highly activated in breast cancers. More significantly, the attenuation of Notch signaling by γ-secretase inhibitor can inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells by both causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus, targeting Notch signaling may be of therapeutic value in breast cancers.

35548944358	Intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy for an ovarian cancer ascite model in Fischer 344 rat using hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether	With limited treatment options, intraperitoneal spread of ovarian cancer is a common problem leading to high morbidity. Intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy combined with debulking surgery to treat residual disease is an alternative choice for clinicians. Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) is a promising second-generation photosensitizer developed in China. Our study was designed to investigate the phototoxicity of HMME on ovarian cancer. NuTu-19, a cell line derived from adenocarcinoma of Fischer 344 rat, and its allogeneic graft ascites tumor model was used in this study. HMME was confirmed to be localized in cytolysosome, and HMME-based photosensitization induced direct necrosis as well as mitochondria damage. The photocytotoxicity of HMME was both light- and drug dose-dependent and no significant dark cytotoxicity was observed in NuTu-19 cells. With the ascite tumor-bearing Fischer 344 rat model, HMME-based intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy was proved to be useful in improving the prognosis of ovarian cancer. Thus, this study provides evidence that HMME-based photodynamic therapy is an effective adjuvant therapy for ovarian cancer. © 2007 Japanese Cancer Association.

38649094601	Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule in cardiac allografts and significance thereof: Experiment with rats	Objective: To investigate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in allograft with chronic rejection (CR) after heart transplantation. Methods: Seventy-two SD rats receiving transplantation of the heats of 71 Wistar rats were divided into 4 equal groups: Group A, undergoing heterotopic cervical heart transplantation (transplanted with donor's heart subcutaneously at the neck) and receiving none intervention, and with the transplanted hearts taken out 3 d after transplantation to the end of CR; Group B, injected intravenously with the splenocytes (SPCs) of the donors on day 0, injected with cyclophomide (CP) on d2, transplanted with the donor hearts on d15, with the transplanted hearts taken out 15 - 120 days after transplantation; Group C, transplanted with the donor's heart and injected intraperitoneally with cyclosporine A (Cs A) 10 mg/kg every other day for 8 - 10 times, and with the transplanted hearts taken out 60 d after transplantation to the end of CR; and Group D, injected intravenously with the SPCs of the donors on day 0, injected with CP on d2, transplanted with the donor hearts on d15, with the transplanted hearts taken out 150 - 420 days after transplantation. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the allografts. Results: The cardiac allograft survival time of Group B was the longest. Less ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and lymphocyte infiltration were observed in SPC and CP-pretreated group. Reversely, protein expression levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were both high and significant lymphocyte infiltration was seen in Groups B and D. There was no significant difference in the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 between Groups A and C (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The expression levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are associated with the occurrence and development of rejection and have positive correlation with the severity of graft rejection. Determination of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 can predict the function of allograft and provide evidence for early diagnosis and prevention of CR.

40149095229	Hypoxia suppresses the production of MMP-9 by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and requires activation of adenosine receptor A2b via cAMP/PKA signaling pathway	The migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of antigen-encounter to regional lymphoid organs is crucial for DCs to function as potent antigen-presenting cells. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is critically for DCs migration across extracellular matrix (ECM). We verified in previous studies that hypoxia diminished the production of MMP-9 in human monocyte-derived DCs via an unknown mechanism. In this study, we found, for the first time to our knowledge, that hypoxia altered the expression of adenosine receptors on matured DCs (mDCs) toward the predominant expression of adenosine receptor A

40749096819	Osteopontin expression in human decidua is associated with decidual natural killer cells recruitment and regulated by progesterone	The involvement of the chemokine osteopontin has been proposed for maintaining successful pregnancy in mice and ruminants; however, little information of its function in human pregnancy is available. Osteopontin expression was assessed in decidua by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining in early pregnant women and RPL (recurrent pregnancy loss) patients. Osteopontin was expressed both in human decidual stromal cells and decidual natural killer (dNK) cells, and higher expression was detected in the later gestational phase compared to the early gestational phase. The osteopontin expression increased with pregnancy progression and higher osteopontin expression was correlated with a larger number of dNK cells. Compared with normal pregnancy, osteopontin expression and dNK cells accumulation were reduced significantly in RPL patients. Osteopontin expression was regulated by progesterone via an in vitro culture model. Our results indicated that osteopontin may play an important role in dNK recruitment and is an essential factor for successful pregnancy.

84877127863	Leptin-mediated regulation of MT1-MMP localization is KIF1B dependent and enhances gastric cancer cell invasion	Leptin overexpression is closely correlated with gastric cancer (GC) invasion, but its exact effect and the underlying mechanism in tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a surface-anchored 'master switch' proteinase, is overexpressed and plays crucial roles in tumor invasion. Here, we characterized the influence of leptin on the generation and surface localization of MT1-MMP in GC and elucidated its molecular mechanisms. Our results revealed that leptin promoted GC cell invasion in vitro by upregulating MT1-MMP expression. Furthermore, cell surface biotinylation assay and flow cytometry demonstrated that the surface expression of MT1-MMP was also enhanced by leptin, and knockdown of kinesin family member 1B (KIF1B, a microtubule plus end-directed monomeric motor protein) by small interference RNA inhibited this process. Notably, coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that leptin enhanced the interaction of MT1-MMP with KIF1B in a time-dependent manner, which consequently contributed to GC cell invasion. Moreover, leptin increased MT1-MMP or KIF1B expression by the protein kinase B (AKT) pathway and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 partially participated in this process. However, only AKT was implicated in the leptin-mediated membrane localization of MT1-MMP. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that leptin, MT1-MMP and KIF1B are overexpressed in GC tissues, and they positively correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. These observations indicate that this regulatory network exists in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that leptin is an effective intracellular stimulator of MT1-MMP and that leptin-enhanced cell surface localization of MT1-MMP is dependent on KIF1B, which consequently plays a critical role in GC invasion. © The Author 2013.

Methods: Women undergoing legal pregnancy termination and women with RSA participated in this prospective study. Immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to analyse levels of IDO protein and mRNA in placenta, decidua and HTR-8/SVneo cells. Culture medium collected from trophoblast villous explant or HTR-8/SVneo cell cultures was used to measure IDO activity in response to interferon (IFN)-γ treatment. Results: A total of 40 healthy women and 26 women with RSA provided samples of placenta and decidua. For normal pregnancies, IDO protein and mRNA was identified in placental trophoblasts, invasive extravillous trophoblasts and decidual glandular epithelium. IFN-γ significantly increased IDO activity in trophoblast villous explants and HTR-8/SVneo cells. Levels of IDO protein and mRNA in the placenta and decidua from normal pregnancies were significantly higher than in those from RSA. Conclusions: Decreased levels of IDO protein and mRNA in the placenta and decidua from RSA suggest an important role for IDO in the maintenance of normal pregnancy. © The Author(s) 2013.

84897572608	Leptin-mediated regulation of ICAM-1 is Rho/ROCK dependent and enhances gastric cancer cell migration	Background:Our previous study indicates that leptin enhances gastric cancer (GC) invasion. However, the exact effect of leptin on GC metastasis and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a major molecule in stabilising cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, is overexpressed and has crucial roles in tumour metastasis.Methods:Here, we investigated leptin and ICAM-1 expression in GC tissues. Furthermore, we characterised the influence of leptin on ICAM-1 expression in GC cells and elucidated the underlying mechanism.Results:Leptin and ICAM-1 were overexpressed in GC tissues, and a strong positive correlation was observed. They were also related with clinical stage or lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, leptin induced GC cell (AGS and MKN-45) migration by upregulating ICAM-1, and knockdown of ICAM-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) blocked this process. Cell surface ICAM-1, as well as soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1), was also enhanced by leptin. Moreover, leptin increased ICAM-1 expression through Rho/ROCK pathway, which was attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of Rho (C3 transferase) or its downstream effector kinase Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) (Y-27632).Conclusions:Our findings indicate that leptin enhances GC cell migration by increasing ICAM-1 through Rho/ROCK pathway, which might provide new insight into the significance of leptin in GC. © 2014 Cancer Research UK.

41649121070	Expression of BAFF in the trophoblast and decidua of normal early pregnant women and patients with recurrent spontaneous miscarriage	Background: BAFF, the B cell activation factor, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family that binds to BCMA, TACI, and BAFF-R. Previous studies have shown that members of the TNF family are detected in human placental trophoblast cells, but the expression patterns of BAFF involved in human desidua and the differential expression of BAFF between normal pregnancy and miscarriage are still incompletely documented or unknown. This study wasp designed to investigate the expression of BAFF and BAFF-R in the trophoblast and decidua of normal early pregnant women and recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) patients. Methods: Forty-five patients with RSA and 45 normal pregnant women were included in this study. By reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western - blotting and immunohistochemical experiments, we explored the expression of BAFF and BAFF-R in the maternal-fetal interface of normal early pregnant women and RSA patients. Results: Analysis by RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that BAFF was detected in both trophoblast and decidua of all the samples, and the expression level was higher in the tissues of normal early pregnant women (P<0.05) than that of recurrent spontaneous abortion patients under the same gestational weeks. Messages for BAFF-R were absent. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that expression of BAFF was cell-specific which was localized to villous cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells in trophoblast and to stromal cells in decidua. Whereas BAFF was prominent on the trophoblast and decidua of normal early pregnant women, it was decreased in the tissues of RSA patients. Conclusions: BAFF might steer maternal leukocytes away from a harmful immune response and toward a favorable one and play a potentially vital role for successful pregnancy.

The serum protein profiles from 102 cases (36 KBD patients, 16 controls in KBD areas, 33 controls in non-KBD areas, and 17 osteoarthritis controls) were detected by SELDI-TOF MS and weak cation-exchange protein chip. Differently expressed peaks in KBD were identified by comparing the data among the four groups using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction at a significance level of 0.05. Then, those 102 cases were used to generate a classification tree as the training set, and an additional 34 cases were collected as the test set. A classification tree was generated by Biomarker Patterns Software (Ciphergen). Multiple protein changes were detected in the KBD group, including three potential biomarkers (15 886, 5336, 6113 m/z). A classification tree with three distinct proteins was generated. The classification tree was able to distinguish the KBD patients from the controls with 88.89% specificity and 86.36% sensitivity. The study demonstrates that marked serum proteomic changes exist in KBD. The proteins represented by the differently expressed peaks are candidate biomarkers for KBD. © 2008 Springer.

Methods: Mature and immature DC (iDC), which were induced from the monocytes generated from peripheral blood of healthy donor, were treated with BP for 24 h. Then the iDC were incubated with FITC-conjugated OVA at 37°C for 4 h and the phagocytic ability was analyzed by FACS. The mature DC(mDC) were collected and the expression of co-stimulation molecules were analyzed by FACS. Results: DC were generated and they expressed CD80, CD83, CD86, CD1a and HLA-DR. After DC were treated with BP, the phagocytic ability and the expression of co-stimulation molecules (CD80, CD86) were significantly increased. Conclusion: BP could regulate the phagocytic ability of DC and increase the expression of co-stimulation molecules, which maybe contribute to its antitumor metastasis.

The TIM-3 pathway, however, has not been investigated in acquired aplastic anemia (AA). In this study, we examined the expression of TIM-3 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) at both transcript and protein levels in 29 acquired AA patients and in 31 controls. Increased mRNA expression of TIM-3 and IFN-γ were observed in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells from AA patients and controls using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. An increase of TIM-3 expression on PBMCs was detected increased in AA patients by flow cytometry. An overproduction of IFN-γ was determined in the sera from AA patients by enzyme-linked immunoassay. In addition, the expression of TIM-3 ligand, galectin-9, increased in PBMCs from AA patients. The results are the first human data to demonstrate the increase of TIM-3 expression in AA. The enhanced TIM-3 engagement by its ligand in AA patients may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. © 2008 The Authors.

However, the effects of fucoidan on maturation process and activation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) remain to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that the level of special marks and polarization phenotype of DCs was altered by fucoidan. Human monocytes were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days followed by another 2 days in the presence of fucoidan or LPS. Then DCs were harvested on day 7 and were examined using functional assays. We demonstrated that fucoidan up-regulated the expression of HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules of DCs. However the endocytic activity was impaired markedly. Fucoidan induces their Th1-promoting tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) secretion, and enhances their allostimulatory capacity. In an allogeneic MLR assay, DCs treated with fucoidan were potent in the secretion of IL-12p70, TNF-α and IFN-γ. Naive T cells stimulated by fucoidan-treated DCs differentiated towards a helper T cell type 1 (Th1) response depending on IL-12 secretion. These results suggest that fucoidan may induce immature DCs maturation and drive their differentiation towards a Th1-polarizing phenotype. Moreover, our data suggest that DCs appear to be a potential target for the immunomodulatory capacity of fucoidan and fucoidan may be used on DC-based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

67449096301	Cross-talk between Notch and EGFR signaling in human breast cancer cells	Notch and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling play critical roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and thereby may contribute to the development of breast cancer. We constitutively overexpressed active Notch1 in human breast cancer cells to explore the consequences of Notch1 signaling on cell growth and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that EGFR expression was increased. Then, using EGFR inhibitor, we found it exhibited an inhibitory role on human breast cancer cells. Overexpression of Notch1 could reverse EGFR inhibitor-induced cell toxicity, suggesting that Notch and EGFR signaling may be positively cross-linked in human breast cancer.

65949125076	Effects of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) on the growth & adhesion in tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells	Background & objectives: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is a central transcriptional regulator of hypoxic response. Suppression of HIF-1α is important for exploring hypoxia-induced pathophysiological events. This study was carried out to analyze the hypoxia-induced changes of biological characteristics in the human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line Tca8113 and evaluate the effects of HIF-1α on the phenotype of the tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: HIF-1α gene was silenced with synthesized short interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNA). HIF-1α expression was measured on mRNA level by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and protein level by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The cell cycle and apoptosis of Tca8113 cells were analyzed by FACS. The proliferation and adhesion of Tca8113 cells were determined by MTT colorimetric assay. Results: Tca8113 could survive and showed a more aggressive phenotype under hypoxic condition. Exposure to hypoxia induced a prolonged elevation of HIF-1α protein and transfection of siRNA targeting HIF-1α (siRNA

Methods: Genotyping of MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism was conducted by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism with blood and villous samples from 95 women diagnosed as having 1st trimester missed abortion. Results: The MDM2 SNP309 G/G genotype was associated with a higher risk of missed abortion compared with the T/T+ T/G genotype in blood (P = 0.010; odds ratio (OR): 2.164; 95 confidence interval (CI): 1.207-3.878) and villous samples (P = 0.043; OR: 2.767; 95 CI: 1.092-7.011). Conclusions: The MDM2 SNP309 G/G genotype may be a genetic risk factor for missed abortion.

68249153389	Hypoxia skews dendritic cells to a T helper type 2-stimulating phenotype and promotes tumour cell migration by dendritic cell-derived osteopontin	It is well recognized that tissue microenvironments are involved in regulating the development and function of dendritic cells (DC). Oxygen supply, which varies in different tissues, has been accepted as an important microenvironmental factor in regulating the biological functions of several immune cells and as being involved in tumour progression and metastasis. However, little is known about the effect of hypoxia on the biological functions of DC and the effect of these hypoxia-conditioned DC on tumour metastasis. In this study, we analysed the transcriptional profiles of human monocyte-derived immature DC (imDC) and mature DC (mDC) cultured under normoxia and hypoxia by microarray, and found a body of potential targets regulating the functions of DC during hypoxia. In addition, the phagocytic ability of hypoxic imDC markedly decreased compared with that of normoxic imDC. Importantly, hypoxic DC poorly induced the proliferation of allogeneic T cells, but polarized allogeneic CD4

Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression of CEACAM1, LYVE1 and CD31, double-labelling immunofluorescence was used to detect the co-expression of CEACAM1 and LYVE1, and double-labelling immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the co-expression of LYVE1 and CD31 in vessels. Membranous CEACAM1 was expressed in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and cytoplastic CEACAM1 in poorly and moderately differentiated carcinoma (P < 0.05). More CEACAM1-positive vessels were observed in CEACAM1-positive tumors with cytoplasmic expression than with membranous expression (P < 0.001). Co-expression of CEACAM1 and LYVE1, LYVE1 and CD31 in vessels was more common in CEACAM1-positive tumors with cytoplasmic expression than with membranous expression (P < 0.001). CEACAM1 has different distribution in oral carcinoma. Membranous CEACAM1 inhibits angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, but cytoplasmic CEACAM1 promotes angiogenesis, and even promotes lymphangiogenesis by mediating the transformation of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) into lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

70349308726	CLIC4 mediates TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation in ovarian cancer	Stromal myofibroblasts, activated by crosstalk signaling between the tumour and stroma, play a critical role in tumour development and progression. Chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) may be functionally import for tumour stromal fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiaton, but the molecular mechanism of the process has not been addressed. In this study, the expression of CLIC4 in ovarian cancer tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and we used an indirect co-culture model of ovarian cancer cells and normal fibroblasts to demonstrate the molecular pathway in which CLIC4 participated during the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. The results showed that the expression of CLIC4 in 96.7% of ovarian cancer stroma and correlated with the up-regulation of myofibroblast marker α-SMA. Conditioned medium from ovarian cancer cells (CM) or transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in fibroblasts, which initiated up-regulation of CLIC4 expression, then resulted in myofibroblast conversion. Moreover, inhibition of CLIC4 significantly reduced the expressions of factors related to the phenotype and functions of myofibroblasts, such as α-SMA, VEGF and HGF. These results suggest that ROS-initiated CLIC4 up-regulation is required for TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiaton in ovarian cancer, indicating that inhibiting the CLIC4 might have therapeutic potential targeting tumour stroma.

As these cells are genetically more stable than cancer cells, there has been enormous interest in developing targeted molecular therapies against them. Chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been linked with promoting stromal cell transdifferentiation in various cancers, but little is known of their roles in ovarian cancer. In this study, we examined the functional roles that both CLIC4 and ROS play in the process of ovarian cancer cell-stimulated or TGF-β1 induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. We also examine whether it is possible to reverse such a process, with the aim of developing novel therapies against ovarian cancer by targeting activated transdifferentiated myofibroblasts. Results: We demonstrate that TGF-β1 induced or CM

72149125306	Overexpression of Kif2a promotes the progression and metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue	The aim of this study was to examine the Kif2a expression and its role in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT). The study included 44 cases of primary tumor and the corresponding adjacent tissues, 20 cases of primary tumor with lymph node metastasis. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the Kif2a expression and its correlation with clinicopathologic factors in oral tongue cancer. The immunohistochemistry showed that Kif2a expression was stronger in oral tongue cancer tissues than in paired adjacent tissues (P < 0.01), and the higher expression of Kif2a was also significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.01), tumor clinical stage (P < 0.01). In addition, in vitro results from transwell chamber assay showed that Tca8113 cells transfected with Kif2a-siRNA had a decreased migratory ability (P < 0.01) compared to nonsense-siRNA-transfected cells. Therefore we speculate the overexpression of Kif2a might be involved in the progression, invasion and metastasis of SCCOT and Kif2a should be as a predictor for prognosis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77149154994	HIF-dependent induction of adenosine receptor A2b skews human dendritic cells to a Th2-stimulating phenotype under hypoxia	Hypoxia is a common characteristic of many pathological and physiological conditions that can markedly change cellular metabolism and cause the accumulation of extracellular adenosine. Recent studies have shown that adenosine can modulate the function of certain immune cell types through binding with different adenosine receptors. Our previous studies have shown that hypoxia has an effect on the biological activity of dendritic cells (DCs) by inducing their differentiation towards a Th2 polarising phenotype. However, the mechanisms underlying this suppression remain unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that hypoxic mDCs predominantly express adenosine receptor A2b. The A2b receptor antagonist MRS1754 was able to increase the production of IL-12p70 and TNF-α by hypoxic mDCs and elevate the amount of Th1 cytokine IFN-γ production in a mDCs-T-cell co-culture system. We also found that the effect of hypoxia on IL-12p70 production was mediated via increased intracellular cAMP levels through the up-regulation of A2b adenosine receptor and the preferential expression of adenosine A2b receptors in hypoxic mDCs was HIF-1α dependent. Therefore, the hypoxic mDCs could provide a useful tool for researching the function of A2bR in human DCs. Our results offer new insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activities of DCs in local-tissue hypoxic microenvironments. © 2010 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

77949457142	RNAi-mediated knockdown of Notch-1 leads to cell growth inhibition and enhanced chemosensitivity in human breast cancer	Notch signaling plays a critical role in determining cell fate such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant Notch signaling has tumor-promoting function in breast cancer. We hypothesized that Notch signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for human breast cancer. To address this issue, we down-regulated the expression of the Notch-1 receptor by siRNA in human breast cancer cells. We found that the down-regulation of Notch-1 signaling caused cancer cell growth inhibition by apoptosis induction. The effect of the down-regulation of Notch-1 may be through the inactivation of NF-κB. In addition, the down-regulation of Notch-1 signaling increased chemosensitivity to doxorubicin and docetaxel. Our results suggested that Notch signaling may be a promising target for breast cancer treatment.

77949899643	A novel tumor suppressor gene RhoBTB2 (DBC2): Frequent loss of expression in sporadic breast cancer	RhoBTB2 was isolated recently as a tumor suppressor gene from human chromosome 8p21.3. Although RhoBTB2 was found to be frequently lost in breast cancer lines, expression status of RhoBTB2 in sporadic breast cancer tissues and its clinical and prognostic value, however, remain unclear. Tissue samples from breast cancer patients and normal controls and cell samples from cell lines were collected and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to monitor the presence of RhoBTB2 mRNA. The protein expression of RhoBTB2 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Cumulative survival time was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. We discovered that RhoBTB2 expression was lacking in a breast ductal epithelial carcinoma cell line T-47D but was expressed in other types of tumor cell lines and normal tissues we tested. The results from tissue samples showed that RhoBTB2 was absent in 60% of breast cancers on both the mRNA and protein level. The results from RT-PCR were completely uniform with those from immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that loss of RhoBTB2 more frequently occurred in postmenopausal patients of age ≥50 yr old and in patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. The prognostic value of RhoBTB2 in breast cancers also be assessed by a long-term follow-up investigation and we found that patients with RhoBTB2-negative breast cancer were linked to poor clinical prognosis. Therefore, the loss of RhoBTB2 expression is a common occurrence in breast cancers and it is an important factor in the development and prognosis of sporadic breast cancer. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods: Forty patients with endometriosis and 15 control women were recruited for the study. Following isolation of total RNA from endometria and reverse transcription, cDNA samples were amplified to quantify the level of MIF expression by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. All of the endometriosis tissue and normal endometrium specimens were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Results: The levels of MIF in eutopic and ectopic endometria in endometriosis patients were significantly higher than in normal eutopic endometria (P < 0.01). Further, when comparing MIF in eutopic endometria (separated by phases) between the endometriosis and control groups, MIF was higher in the former group, both in the proliferative and secretory phases (P < 0.05). In addition, the MIF mRNA level was cycle phase-dependent and increased in the proliferative phase, both in women with endometriosis and the control women, compared with the level in the secretory phase (P < 0.05). There was no significant association between MIF expression and American Fertility Society staging of endometriosis (P > 0.05). However, MIF levels were obviously elevated in sterile women in the endometriosis group compared with women in the endometriosis group who were not sterile (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The expression of MIF was increased significantly in the eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue of women with endometriosis, and this factor may play a possible role in endometriosis- associated infertility. © 2010 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

The role of IL-21 in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) remains unknown. Materials and Methods We examined the expression of IL- 21, IL-17, and interferon (IFN)-γ in ITP patients and controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. Detection of specific anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa and/or GPIb/IX autoantibodies was measured by modified monoclonal antibody specific immobilization of platelet antigens. Results IL-21 was expressed on both CD3+CD8- T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Plasma IL-21 level and the percentage of CD3+CD8-IL-21+ T cells and CD3+CD8+IL-21+ T cells were significantly elevated in ITP patients compared to controls. The percentage of CD3+CD8-IL-17+ T (Th17), CD3+CD8-IFN-γ+ T (Th1), and CD3+CD8+IFN-γ+ T (Tc1) cells also significantly increased in ITP patients. Moreover, we found a significant positive correlation between CD3+CD8-IL-21+ T cells and Th17 cells. In addition, a positive correlation between CD3+CD8-IL-21+ T cells and Th1 cells was also found. Conclusion Together, our results indicated a possible role of IL-21 in ITP patients correlated to Th17 and Th1 cells, and blockade of IL-21 may be a reasonable therapeutic strategy for ITP especially those with active disease. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

A critical parameter of diagnostic biomarkers is the accuracy and reproducibility of protein patterns. We evaluated the effects of common pretreatment protocols on protein patterns generated using SELDI mass spectrometry with two different protein capture strategies (including functional protein chips and functionalized magnetic beads prior to MS analysis) in AF. Method: Various extrinsic factors involved in processing and storing amniotic fluid, including matrix composition, sample storage time, temperature and freeze-thaw cycles, were analyzed regarding their impact on AF protein patterns using SELDI mass spectrometry with 2 different protein capture strategies. Results: Three extrinsic factors (sample storage for 3. days at either room temperature or 4°C or freeze-thawing the sample 5 times) significantly decreased the number or intensities of protein peaks detected in AF. Matrix dilutions also changed the spectra of AF, with more peaks and higher intensities observed with 50% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA). Moreover, protein chips captured more proteins or peptides than magnetic beads on SELDI-TOF MS profiling of AF. Conclusions: These results suggest that extrinsic factors must be taken into account for valid data interpretation to ensure good reproducibility of AF profiling by SELDI mass spectrometry. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78649337583	ACE2 overexpression ameliorates left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in a rat model of myocardial infarction	The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may favorably affect left ventricular (LV) remodeling and function after myocardial infarction (MI). The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated to produce anterior MI in 100 Wistar-Kyoto rats that were randomly divided into Ad-ACE2, Ad-ACE2+A779, Ad-EGFP, model, and sham groups. Two weeks later, rats in the Ad-ACE2 and Ad-EGFP groups received direct intramyocardial injection of Ad-ACE2 and Ad-EGFP, respectively. Rats in the Ad-ACE2+A779 group received both intramyocardial injection of Ad-ACE2 and a continuous intravenous infusion of A779 for 15 days. LV volume and systolic function, the extent of myocardial fibrosis, and levels of ACE2, angiotensin II (Ang II), and collagen I protein expression were evaluated. Four weeks after ACE2 gene transfer, the Ad-ACE2 group showed reduced LV volume, extent of myocardial fibrosis, and expression levels of ACE, Ang II, and collagen I in the myocardium, and increased LV ejection fraction and levels of ACE2 activity and expression in comparison with the Ad-EGFP and model groups. These results suggest that ACE2 overexpression attenuated LV fibrosis and improved LV remodeling and systolic function. In conclusion, overexpression of ACE2 favorably affected the pathological process of LV remodeling after MI by inhibiting ACE activity, reducing AngII levels, and up-regulating Ang-(1-7) expression, thus providing a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of heart failure. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

78751584945	Overexpression of chromokinesin KIF4 inhibits proliferation of human gastric carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo	Gastric carcinoma is a common type of malignant tumors and is associated with high death rates. The pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma is still unclear, and increasing evidence shows that many factors contribute to this process. Chromokinesin KIF4 is involved in multiple critical cellular processes. Recently, it has become apparent that KIF4 plays a crucial suppressive role in tumorigenesis. However,z the role of KIF4 in human gastric cancer is still unclear. In this study, we examined expression profiles of KIF4 in gastric carcinoma specimens and generated gastric cancer cells that stably express GFP-KIF4 fusion protein (designated as BGC-GFP-KIF4 cells) followed by cell proliferation, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and soft agar colony-formation assays. Simultaneously, we further examined the capability of tumor formation of BGC-GFP-KIF4 cells in nude mice. The results showed that among 23 gastric carcinoma specimens, 13 cases (56.6%) had lower expression of KIF4 compared with corresponding adjacent tissues. In addition, there was a significant correlation between low expression of KIF4 and poor differentiation of tumor (P=0.024). Overexpression of KIF4 in BGC cells inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, as well as their ability to form tumors in vivo. Our findings suggest that human chromokinesin KIF4 functions as an inhibitor of gastric cancer cell proliferation and might serve as a novel biological target to cure human gastric carcinoma. © 2010 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

The constructed si-RNAs were transfected into Tca8113 cells and Gadd45a expression was determined using quantitative real-time PCR and Western-blot. After 24-h exposure to IR at a dose rate of 4 Gy/min, apoptosis of Tca8113 cells was detected using flow cytometry, and radiosensitivity was measured using MTT assays.Results:IR apparently increased the expression of Gadd45a at mRNA and protein levels in Tca8113 cells. The effect was efficiently inhibited by transfection with Gadd45a si-RNA (P<.01). Furthermore, silencing Gadd45a gene significantly increased cell viability and decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells during irradiation, which indicated that IR-induced Gadd45a over-expression could increase the radiosensitivity of Tca8113 cells.Conclusion:These results indicated that targeting Gadd45a may have important therapeutic implications in sensitizing Tca8113 cells to IR. © 2011 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.

Interleukin-27 (IL27) has been shown to bear both proinflammatory and anti-inflammtory effects. In the present study, plasma levels of IL27, interferon gamma (IFNG), IL4, and IL17A were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 23 active ITP patients, 20 patients in remission and 20 healthy controls. mRNA expression levels of IL27, EBI3, IL27 receptor (IL27RA), IL17A and RAR-related orphan receptor C (RORC) were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Significantly lower levels of plasma IL27, IL4, mRNA expression of IL27, EBI3 and higher levels of plasma IFNG as well as mRNA expression of IL17A, RORC were observed in active ITP patients compared with healthy controls or patients in remission. No statistical difference was found in IL27RA mRNA expression or plasma IL17A levels among active ITP patients and controls. A negative correlation was found between the IL27 and RORC mRNA expression levels in active ITP patients. Our data demonstrated that active ITP patients had decreased plasma and mRNA expression levels of IL27, suggesting that it might be involved in the pathophysiological process of ITP. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this study, we investigated whether p53 codon 72 and HDM2 promoter (SNP309) polymorphisms were associated with the development of missed abortion.MethodsWomen with missed abortions (n 60) and healthy controls (n 64) were included in the study. Genotyping of the p53 codon 72 and HDM2 SNP309 (T > G) polymorphisms was performed by PCR with sequence-specific primers and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, respectively, using villous samples. The mRNA and protein levels for p53 and HDM2 were measured by real-time PCR and semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, respectively.ResultsFor the p53 codon 72 polymorphism, no difference in genotype or allele frequencies was observed in women with missed abortion versus controls. However, for the HDM2 SNP309 (T > G) polymorphism, G/G genotype was associated with a higher risk of missed abortion compared with the T/T T/G genotypes (P 0.043). Women carrying the HDM2 G/G genotype or p53 Pro/Pro genotype had higher HDM2 mRNA (P= 0.04 and P 0.013, respectively) and protein (P =0.001 and P 0.037, respectively) levels than women with other HDM2 SNP309 and p53 codon 72 genotypes. Conclusions The genotypes HDM2 SNP309 G/G and p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro can induce high levels of HDM2, which may be associated with missed abortion. © 2011 The Author.

Moreover, the combination therapy significantly increased the protein expression of caspase-8, activated Bid and cytochrome c. Meanwhile, the expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL was reduced and intracellular calcium elevated obviously during the early stage of treatment. Therefore, mitochondrial pathway was involved in the apoptosis of Fas-negative HCC cells induced by IFN-α/5-FU and Ca

79959193759	Aberrant expression of chemokine receptor CCR4 in human gastric cancer contributes to tumor-induced immunosuppression	The chemokine receptor CCR4 is preferentially expressed on certain immune cells and some hematological tumor cells, which play pivotal roles in suppression of host immune response. However, the reasons for the upmodulation of CCR4 and its immune functions in solid tumors remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to determine the expression profiles of CCR4 in gastric cancer cells and its role in regulating antitumor immunity. CCR4 expression was assessed in 63 cases of gastric carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. We found cancer cells in lymphocyte-rich carcinomas more frequently showed moderate to strong positive staining for CCR4 than those in conventional carcinomas (P=0.041), and also found a positive relationship between expression of CCR4 and tumor necrosis factor-α (P=0.012). Stimulation of gastric cell lines with various cytokines showed that tumor necrosis factor-α uniquely upmodulated CCR4 expression through activation of nuclear factor-κB. Additional coculture experiments showed the forced expression of CCR4 in SGC-7901 cells caused a significant reduction of γ-interferon and elevation of interleukin-10 secretion in the supernatants from cocultured SGC-7901 cells and PBMCs. In addition, granzyme A production in cancer cell-cocultured CD56

80053471860	BMP2 and VEGF promote angiogenesis but retard terminal differentiation of osteoblasts in bone regeneration by up-regulating Id1	Inadequate vascularization limits the repair of bone defects. In order to improve angiogenesis and accelerate osteogenesis, the synergism of co-cultured cells with genetic modification in bone regeneration was investigated in this study. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were transfected with the genes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) by adenovirus, respectively. The co-cultured cells, designated as four groups including BMSC EPC, Ad-BMP2-BMSC + EPC, BMSC + Ad-VEGF-EPC, and Ad-BMP2-BMSC Ad-VEGF-EPC groups, were seeded on an alginate gel and then implanted into rat intramuscularly to evaluate the effects on angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Both VEGF and BMP2 could induce the overexpression of inhibitor of DNA-binding 1(Id1) gene which significantly promoted tube formation in vitro and increase the amount of blood vessels in the Ad-BMP2-BMSC Ad-VEGF-EPC group after implantation. Nevertheless, overexpression of Id1 retarded the terminal differentiation of osteoblasts and the bone formation. Later, osteogenic gene expression at transcriptional level, calcium nodules, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity showed a gradual decrease and the amount of newly formed osteogenesis area exhibited a small increase in the Ad-BMP2-BMSC + Ad-VEGF-EPC group. This finding suggests that a balanced regulation of Id1 expression in VEGF-EPCs and BMP2-BMSCs may be critical to cell-based and gene-based approaches for bone regeneration. © 2011 The Author.

80054775002	Intracellular metabolism, subcellular localization and phototoxicity of HMME/HB in ovarian cancer cells	Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered a promising new strategy for ovarian cancer treatment. As the key component in PDT, photo sensitizer metabolism and localization in cancer cells is particularly important. Materials and Methods: The localization of the photosensitizers hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) and hypocrellin B (HB) were determined in the ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and NuTu-19 by fluorescence microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy(LSCM). A JD801 image analysis system was used to analyze the fluorescence intensity of the photosensitizers in the cells. The phototoxicity of both drugs to the cancer cells was determined by MTT assay. Results: Both photosensitizers were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Drug uptake reached a peak after 4 h incubation with HB and after 3 h incubation with HMME. Within a certain range, the higher the concentration, the stronger the fluorescence became and at 40 μg/ml, the intracellular photosensitizer had reached saturation. Based on these results PDT was applied to SKOV3 cells. All the cells were killed when the photosensizer dose reached 40 μg/ml. Conclusion: PDT is an effective therapy for ovarian cancer cells.

80955149262	Clinicopathological significance of CEACAM1 gene expression in breast cancer	Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a cell adhesion molecule expressed in a variety of cell types. The role of CEACAM1 in breast cancer development and progression is largely unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to examine CEACAM1 expression in breast cancer with long-term follow-up. CEACAM1 expression level in primary breast cancer was low or undetectable. In 65% of the cases, CEACAM1 expression within tumor tissue was lower than that in adjacent tissues. In 20% of the cases, CEACAM1 was negative. In 28.3% of cases, equivalent CEACAM1 expression level was detected in tumor and adjacent tissues. The expression level of CEACAM1 in tumor tissue was negatively correlated with patient mortality, while positively correlated with the expression level of ER+/ PR+. CEACAM1 expression was not related with patients' age, pathological classification, lymphatic involvement and the size of tumor. The down-regulation of CEACAM1 was correlated with negative ER-/PR- and might be attributed to the malignant process of breast cancer. The prognosis of the patients with low CEACAM1 expression and high tumor pathological grade were poorer than those patients with high expression and low pathological grade, P < 0.05. Clinically, it is possible to predict the prognosis among the patients of breast cancer by measuring CEACAM1 gene expression in the tumor tissues. © 2011 by The Chinese Physiological Society and Airiti Press Inc.

80755189947	The possible roles of OPN-regulated CEACAM1 expression in promoting the survival of activated T cells and the apoptosis of oral keratinocytes in oral lichen planus patients	Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the oral mucosa that represents T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. The regulation and roles of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), a novel immune molecule, in the immunopathogenesis of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases remain unclear. In the current paper, CEACAM1 was found to be overexpressed in peripheral Tcells and epithelial cells in oral lichen planus patients. A fraction of infiltrating inflammatory mononuclear cells in the lamina propria of the oral lichen planus mucosa also expressed CEACAM1. Importantly, for the first time, CEACAM1 expression in T cells and in normal human oral keratinocytes was demonstrated to be regulated differently by osteopontin in vitro. Furthermore, the apoptosis of oral keratinocytes and activated T cells can be markedly suppressed by CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibodies. In conclusion, OPN-regulated CEACAM1 expression may play a critical role in the immunopathogenesis of oral lichen planus. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84856430431	Proteomic analysis reflects different histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer	Ovarian carcinoma is a significant cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. As a heterogeneous disease, distinct clinical and molecular characteristics exist among different histologic subtypes. With the developments in proteomics, surfaced-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) is sensitive enough to detect minute quantity of proteins from serum or microdissected cryostat sections. Herein we hypothesized that differentially expressed protein profiles exist in ovarian carcinomas with distinct histologic subtypes. Compared with endometrioid carcinoma, two peaks were significantly higher in serous carcinoma with the m/. z of 3622. Da and 4778. Da, reinforcing the need to treat different histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer as different disease entities. Better understanding of these potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers followed with proof-of-target effect will finally contribute to rational combinations of novel therapy and improve individual ovarian cancer patient outcome. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Material and Methods: Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the location and expression of HGF and TSP-1 protein in ovarian cancer and benign ovarian tumor tissue. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was applied to detect HGF and TSP-1 gene mRNA expression in ovarian cancer and benign ovarian tumor tissue. Results: The level and positive expression rate of HGF mRNA in ovarian cancer tissue was significantly higher than in ovarian adenoma tissues. The positive expression of HGF protein in ovarian cancer was related with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and lymph node metastasis. The level and positive expression rate of TSP-1 mRNA in ovarian cancer tissue was lower than in ovarian adenoma. The absence expression of TSP-1 protein in ovarian cancer was significantly related with FIGO stage and histological grade. The intensity of these positive expressions in ovarian cancer tissues were significant negatively associated with each other. Conclusion: Abnormal expression of HGF and TSP-1 may be related to malignant progression of ovarian cancer and associated in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. © 2011 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

84859236764	Progress in research of osteopontin and its signal transduction pathway in tumor metastasis	Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted glyco-phospho-protein that contains a conserved Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) sequence. Osteopontin mainly participates in a number of process of tumor metastasis through binding with integrin and CD44 receptors. Recently, osteopontin and its signaling pathway in the regulation of tumor invasion and metastasis have aroused concern. Osteopontin can activate the phosphorylation of several kinases (PI3K, NIK, PLC, PKC, MAPK) by interacting with integrin avβ3 and CD44 receptors, thereby plays a crucial role in inhibiting apoptosis and activation of matrix degradation of a variety of proteases (uPA and MMPs) which ultimately promotes tumor metastasis.

84860420805	RhoBTB2 (DBC2) functions as tumor suppressor via inhibiting proliferation, preventing colony formation and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells	RhoBTB2 was isolated recently as a tumor suppressor gene from sporadic breast cancer. Although RhoBTB2 was found to be frequently lost in breast cancer and a variety of cancers, its antitumor effect, however, remains unclear. In this study, we constructed a recombinant expression vector pEGFP-N1-RhoBTB2 and transfected it into RhoBTB2-negative breast tumor cell line T-47D. Stable transformanted cells were identified by fluorescence microscope, RT-PCR and Western blot. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Colony forming efficiency of breast tumor cells was detected by colony formation assay. Morphological change of apoptotic cells was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Apoptotic ratio was determined by flow cytometry. Cell invasion and migration ability assay were performed using transwell system. Overexpression of RhoBTB2 in breast tumor cells significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of tumor cells. In addition, RhoBTB2 also elevated the apoptotic ratio and caused typical changes of apoptotic morphology in breast tumor cells of RhoBTB2 overexpression. But RhoBTB2 did not influence the invasion and migration ability of breast tumor cells. Therefore, RhoBTB2 is an important tumor suppressor gene related with breast cancer and may play antitumor roles by inhibiting proliferation, preventing colony formation and promoting the apoptosis of tumor cells. However, the precise mechanism behind the antitumor effects of RhoBTB2 needs to be investigated further. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84861204062	Regulation of Th1/Th2 polarization by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 via modulating dendritic cells	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) is one of a family of proteins inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases, which has also been identified as a mediator for checking inflammation. Meanwhile, it is well known that inflammation causes the activation of the immune response. However, it is not clear whether TIMP-3 plays a role in the immune system. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel function of TIMP-3 in Th1/Th2 polarization through its influence on the antigen-presenting cells. First, TIMP-3 was found strikingly up-regulated by IL-4 during the differentiation of human dendritic cells via the p38MAPK pathway. Second, the expression of costimulatory molecule-CD86 was repressed by TIMP-3. Besides, the induction of IL-12 in matured dendritic cells was significantly inhibited in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, dendritic cells matured in the presence of TIMP-3 could stimulate allogeneic naive T helper (Th) cells to display a prominent Th2 polarization. Importantly, in an autoimmune disorder-primary immune thrombocytopenia, TIMP-3 showed a statistically positive correlation with IL-4 and platelet count, but a negative correlation with IFN-γ in patient blood samples. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo data clearly suggested a novel role of TIMP-3 in Th1/Th2 balance in humans. © 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.

Methods T98G glioma cells and THP1 monocytes were pretreated with marchantin C or fucoidan, respectively. Conditioned media were used for endothelial cell tube formation assay and detection of sFlt-1 by ELISA. Depletion of sFlt-1 was achieved by a neutralizing antibody to assess its role in the process. Key findings Marchantin C inhibited angiogenesis induced by T98G cells while fucoidan inhibited both T98G and THP1 cell-induced angiogenesis. In all three groups in which angiogenesis was inhibited, sFlt-1 level in the supernatants was elevated. Pretreatment of the conditioned media with sFlt-1 antibody restored the inhibited angiogenesis to a certain degree. Conclusions This study suggested for the first time that marchantin C and fucoidan could significantly inhibit angiogenesis induced by glioma cells or monocytes. Up-regulation of sFlt-1 played an important role in this process. © 2012 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to study the distribution of CEACAM5 and OPN, and double-labeling immunohistochemistry was used to observe the relationship between CEACAM5 and OPN expression.CEACAM5 and OPN are found in normal tissue of tongue, but with different expression pattern. CEACAM5 expression mainly with membranous staining is restricted on the superficial epithelium. However, OPN expression with mainly cytoplasmic staining is restricted on the deep epithelium. No colocalization of CEACAM5 and OPN have been observed in normal tissue of tongue. In squamous carcinoma of tongue, CEACAM5 expression with cytoplasmic staining is different from normal tongue tissue with membranous staining, and the transformation of CEACAM5 distribution from membrane to cytoplasm is an important incident for the invasion and differentiation of tumor. CEACAM5 and OPN are colocalized in cytoplasm, and a significant correlation was observed between the positive colocalization and the negative colocalization in the depth of invasion and the differentiation of the tumor. © 2012 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862212279	Phosphate starvation of maize inhibits lateral root formation and alters gene expression in the lateral root primordium zone	Background: Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all living organisms. Maize (Zea mays) is an important human food, animal feed and energy crop throughout the world, and enormous quantities of phosphate fertilizer are required for maize cultivation. Thus, it is important to improve the efficiency of the use of phosphate fertilizer for maize.Results: In this study, we analyzed the maize root response to phosphate starvation and performed a transcriptomic analysis of the 1.0-1.5 cm lateral root primordium zone. In the growth of plants, the root-to-shoot ratio (R/L) was reduced in both low-phosphate (LP) and sufficient-phosphate (SP) solutions, but the ratio (R/L) exhibited by the plants in the LP solution was higher than that of the SP plants. The growth of primary roots was slightly promoted after 6 days of phosphate starvation, whereas the numbers of lateral roots and lateral root primordia were significantly reduced, and these differences were increased when associated with the stress caused by phosphate starvation. Among the results of a transcriptomic analysis of the maize lateral root primordium zone, there were two highlights: 1) auxin signaling participated in the response and the modification of root morphology under low-phosphate conditions, which may occur via local concentration changes due to the biosynthesis and transport of auxin, and LOB domain proteins may be an intermediary between auxin signaling and root morphology; and 2) the observed retardation of lateral root development was the result of co-regulation of DNA replication, transcription, protein synthesis and degradation and cell growth.Conclusions: These results indicated that maize roots show a different growth pattern than Arabidopsis under low-phosphate conditions, as the latter species has been observed to halt primary root growth when the root tip comes into contact with low-phosphate media. Moreover, our findings enrich our understanding of plant responses to phosphate deficits and of root morphogenesis in maize. © 2012 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84863297278	Reduced CMTM5 expression correlates with carcinogenesis in human epithelial ovarian cancer	Objective: Although human chemokinelike factor (CKLF)-like MAL and related proteins for vesicle trafficking transmembrane, domain-containing member 5 (CMTM5) has been proved to play an important role in carcinogenesis and apoptosis in several types of human tumors, the expression of CMTM5 in ovarian cancer remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between CMTM5 expression and the survival of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: Normal surface ovarian epithelium tissues, ovarian cystadenoma tissues, ovarian cancer tissues, and 5 ovarian cancer cell lines were collected. The CMTM5 expressions were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining. The survival information was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The CMTM5 expression was down-regulated in ovarian cancers. The expression of CMTM5 was absent in 30% (24 of 80) of ovarian cancers compared with 4.55% (1 of 22) of normal surface ovarian epithelium tissues and ovarian cystadenomas by immunohistochemistry. The results from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were consistent with those from Western blotting. Furthermore, we found that although CMTM5 expression has no significant correlation with the age of the patients (P = 0.342), clinical stages (P = 0.155), pathologic types (P = 0.0605), or status of metastasis (P = 0.554), it was associated with the 3 groups of different differentiation levels (P = 0.0026) and an increase of CMTM5 loss of expression ratio in patients with preoperative CA125 level more than 500 mIU/mL compared to those with less than 500 mIU/mL (48.57% vs 16.67%, P = 0.0130). Statistical analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method showed that CMTM5 expression had no significant impact on the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer (P = 0.24). Conclusions: The reduced expression of CMTM5 correlates significantly with poorly differentiated ovarian cancer and high preoperative CA125 level. CMTM5 may contribute to the pathogenesis of human epithelial ovarian cancer. Copyright © 2011 by IGCS and ESGO.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Based on a recent study showing that HDACis were able to modulate WNT/β-catenin signaling, we further investigated the influence of HDACis on WNT/β-catenin signaling in T-ALL cells and modulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling in mediating anti-leukemic effects of HDACis. Results from Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and a luciferase reporter assay consistently suggested that two HDACis, valproic acid (VPA) and suberoyl bishydroxamic acid (SBHA), augmented WNT/β-catenin signaling in T-ALL cells. Meanwhile, VPA and SBHA dramatically inhibited cell growth, blocked G2/M cell cycle progression and increased p21

0037870271	Efficacy of lentivirus-mediated and MUC1 antibody-targeted VP22-TK/GCV suicide gene therapy for ovarian cancer	Transfer of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene into tumor cells using virus-based vectors in conjunction with ganciclovir (GCV) exposure provides a potential gene therapy strategy for the treatment of cancer. Effective gene therapy depends on the efficient transfer and specific targeting of therapeutic genes and their protein products to target cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-tumor effect of Lentivirus-mediated and MUC1 antibody-targeted VP22-TKI/GCV suicide gene therapy in animal models. Mouse models were generated with intraperitoneal injection of human epithelial ovarian cancer cells 3AO, which are-MUC1-positive. HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors carrying VP22-TK or scFv-VP22-TK were prepared. The animals were injected intraperitoneally with lentivirus containing scFv-VP22-TK, VP22-TK, followed by GCV treatment. Combined treatment of lentivirus-expressed scFv-VP22-TK or VP22-TK with GCV inhibited the proliferation and prolonged survival times compared with the control vector. The survival time of animals treated with scFv-VP22-TK/GCV was significantly longer than that of animals treated with VP22-TK/GCV (p = 0.006). Conclusion: Our results suggest that MUC1 antibody-targeted VP22-TK/GCV suicide gene therapy can efficiently inhibit ovarian tumor growth and increase survival in a nude mouse model of ovarian carcinoma. These data support the development of this method for human clinical trials.

84866462073	Prognostic impact of δ-like ligand 4 and Notch1 in acute myeloid leukemia	Notch signaling plays a critical role in embryonic vascular development and tumor angiogenesis. The present study was conducted to investigate the prognostic role of the angiogenesis-related Notch ligand and the receptor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and assess whether their expression correlates with that of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 60 untreated AML patients and 40 healthy controls were obtained. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA expression of δ-like ligand 4 (Dll4), Notch1, VEGF, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie2. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels of Dll4 and Notch1. The results demonstrated that Dll4, Notch1, VEGF, VEGFR-2 and Ang-2 expression were signifi- cantly higher in untreated AML patients than in the controls. Univariate analysis of factors associated with the overall survival showed a significantly shorter survival in patients with the unfavorable karyotype, higher Dll4 expression, higher Notch1 expression, higher VEGF expression or higher Ang-2 expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that the karyotype and expression levels of Notch1, Dll4, VEGF and Ang-2 were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Additionally, the prognostic value of Dll4 expression (but not Notch1) was more significant in the subgroup consisting of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Subgroup analysis showed that Notch1 and Dll4 expression levels had a prognostic impact on patients with high VEGF or Ang-2 levels. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the activation of the Notch pathway may indicate an unfavorable prognosis in AML. In particular, Dll4 may be a relevant prognostic marker in intermediate-risk AML.

84871821947	Notch1 is required for hypoxia-induced proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells	Background: Notch1 is a potent regulator known to play an oncogenic role in many malignancies including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Tumor hypoxia and increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity can act as major stimuli for tumor aggressiveness and progression. Although hypoxia-mediated activation of the Notch1 pathway plays an important role in tumor cell survival and invasiveness, the interaction between HIF-1α and Notch1 has not yet been identified in T-ALL. This study was designed to investigate whether hypoxia activates Notch1 signalling through HIF-1α stabilization and to determine the contribution of hypoxia and HIF-1α to proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance in T-ALL. Methods. T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat, Sup-T1) transfected with HIF-1α or Notch1 small interference RNA (siRNA) were incubated in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Their potential for proliferation and invasion was measured by WST-8 and transwell assays. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and assess cell cycle regulation. Expression and regulation of components of the HIF-1α and Notch1 pathways and of genes related to proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot. Results: Hypoxia potentiated Notch1 signalling via stabilization and activation of the transcription factor HIF-1α. Hypoxia/HIF-1α-activated Notch1 signalling altered expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and accelerated cell proliferation. Hypoxia-induced Notch1 activation increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and MMP9, which increased invasiveness. Of greater clinical significance, knockdown of Notch1 prevented the protective effect of hypoxia/HIF-1α against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. This sensitization correlated with losing the effect of hypoxia/HIF-1α on Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression. Conclusions: Notch1 signalling is required for hypoxia/HIF-1α- induced proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance in T-ALL. Pharmacological inhibitors of HIF-1α or Notch1 signalling may be attractive interventions for T-ALL treatment. © 2013 Zou et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84872682153	The upregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-dependent microRNA-182 and microRNA-96 promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation by targeting forkhead box O3 upon leptin stimulation	Leptin overexpression contributes to the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer. However, the functional mechanism and effects remain unclear. The aberrant expression of tumor-related microRNAs may play an important role in the development of cancer. In this report, we demonstrate that crosstalk between leptin and microRNA-182 and microRNA-96 affects the transformation and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Our results showed that leptin enhanced the colony formation of ovarian cancer cells in soft agar. A water-soluble tetrazolium salts assay revealed that leptin promoted ovarian cancer cell (SKOV3 and A2780 cells) proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The growth effects of leptin on ovarian cancer cells were mediated via the reduced expression of forkhead box O3 and its downstream targets p27 and Bim. We demonstrated that leptin upregulated miRNAs that target forkhead box O3 via luciferase reporter assay. Further examination indicated that only the inhibition of microRNA-182 and/or microRNA-96 rescued the expression of forkhead box O3 inhibited by leptin, and their mimics promoted the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 pathway, but not the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, was implicated in the leptin-mediated expression of microRNA-182 and microRNA-96. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the upregulation of microRNA-182 and microRNA-96 targeting forkhead box O3 plays a significant role in the pro-proliferation effect of leptin on ovarian cancer cells, which might provide preliminary experimental clues for the development of new therapies against ovarian cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84874586111	Osteopontin splice variants expressed by breast tumors regulate monocyte activation via MCP-1 and TGF-β1	Osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional glycoprotein, has three transcripts that have distinct roles in tumors in vitro. Whether OPN transcripts have different functions in tumor processes in vivo is unclear. It has been reported that immune cell-derived OPN can promote tumor formation. We propose a hypothesis that tumor-derived OPN may facilitate tumor immune escape by affecting immune cell differentiation and function. In this study, we constructed lentiviral expression vectors of OPN transcripts and transfected them into the MCF-7 cell line. MCF-7 cells transfected with OPN transcripts were injected into the armpit of nude mice, and tumor growth was monitored. The results showed that all OPN transcripts promoted local tumor formation, but that there was no significant difference among transcripts. We also investigated the effect of the OPN expressed by tumor cells on monocyte differentiation by coculturing monocytes with tumor supernatant. We found OPN-c upregulated CD163 levels compared with OPN-a and OPN-b; however, none of the transcripts affected HLA-DR and CD206 levels. All OPN transcripts significantly inhibited TNF-α and enhanced IL-10 production by monocytes. Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of OPN transcripts significantly upregulated TGF-β1 and MCP-1 production by tumor cells. Using neutralizing antibody and recombinant cytokines, we found that OPN overexpressed by tumor cells regulates the production of TNF-α and IL-10 by monocytes partly via MCP-1 and TGF-β1, respectively. Collectively, our results show that OPN transcripts have no distinct role in breast cancer formation in vivo. We also demonstrate that OPN regulates the alternative activation of monocytes via TGF-β1 and MCP-1, which may represent an additional mechanism for tumor immune escape. © 2013 CSI and USTC.

84879090814	Stable gene-silence of Kif2a synergistic with 5-fluorouracil suppresses oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo	Objective: Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT) is one of the most common malignant carcinomas in the head and neck. Recurrence and/or metastasis often results in failure of treatment and decreases the survival of the patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of gene-silence of Kif2a on SCCOT in viro and in vivo. Study design: Plasmid-mediated expression of Kif2a-siRNA (pGPU6/GFP/Kif2a) was employed to silence the expression of Kif2a in Tca8113 cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Tca8113 cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and growth of Tca8113 tumors was determined by intra-tumor injection of pGPU6/GFP/Kif2a in nude mice. Results: Gene-silence of Kif2a suppressed Tca8113 cell proliferation. pGPU6/GFP/Kif2a synergized the tumor suppression effect of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) on Tca8113 cells. Conclusions: Our data support that Kif2a is a potential molecular target for the therapeutics of recurrent and metastatic SCCOT.© 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84885092904	Effects and mechanisms of curcumin and basil polysaccharide on the invasion of SKOV3 cells and dendritic cells	In the present study, a polysaccharide extract was obtained from Ocimum basilicum (basil polysaccharide, BPS) and the effects of curcumin and BPS on the invasion activity of the SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were investigated. SKOV3 cells and immature or mature DCs were treated with 50 μM curcumin or 100 μg/ml BPS. A transwell invasion assay demonstrated that curcumin and BPS differentially regulate the invasion of SKOV3 cells and DCs. Curcumin significantly decreased the invasion of SKOV3 cells and immature and mature DCs, while BPS only decreased SKOV3 cell invasion. Osteopontin (OPN) mRNA and protein expression were significantly reduced in curcumin and BPS-treated SKOV3 cells and curcumin-treated DCs. Furthermore, flow cytometry showed that curcumin significantly inhibited the surface expression of CD44 in SKOV3 cells and DCs, while BPS had a minimal effect on CD44 expression. Matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA and protein expression were also reduced in all curcumin-treated cells and BPS-treated SKOV3 cells. The results indicated that curcumin and BPS regulated invasion of SKOV3 cells and DCs by distinctly downregulating OPN, CD44 and MMP-9 expression. Therefore, Curcumin and BPS may be suitable candidates for DC-based vaccines for ovarian cancer immunotherapy.

0141679060	Experiment studies of antitumor proliferation and metastasis of a new Chinese herb AT-1	Objective: To study the effects of a new Chinese herb AT-1 on the tumor cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro. Methods: Tumor cell proliferation activity was tested by MTT. The ability of tumor cell invasion and migration was assayed by counting the number of tumor cells going throw matrigel. The expression changes of CD44 genes in PG cells treated with AT-1 were tested by FACS. Results: Compared with the control, the proliferation activity of the cells treated with the At-1 was restrained. The invasion and migration ability of PG cells and the expression of the cell adherence related gene CD44 was decreased treatment with AT-1. Conclusion: AT-1 is a new antitumor proliferation and metastasis agent. Its antitumor metastasis effect might be achieved by decreasing the expression of the cell adherence-associate gene CD44.

84893741212	CIZ1 regulates the proliferation, cycle distribution and colony formation of RKO human colorectal cancer cells	Cip1-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (CIZ1) is a nuclear protein that was observed to bind to p21Cip1/Waf1. p21Cip1/Waf1 regulates the cell cycle and is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, the effect of CIZ1 on CRC cells remains unclear. In the present study, CIZ1 was observed to be highly expressed in RKO human CRC cells. Silencing of CIZ1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed RKO cell proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that knockdown of CIZ1 decreased the percentage of cells in the S phase and increased the ratio of cells in the G0/G1 phase in parallel with upregulated cell apoptosis. Moreover, the number and size of RKO cell colonies was repressed by knockdown of the CIZ1 gene. These results suggested that CIZ1 may be involved in colon cancer progression by regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and colony formation. Furthermore, CIZ1-siRNA may provide a novel tool for CRC investigation and therapy.

84893822832	Silencing Kif2a induces apoptosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway	Previous studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of Kif2a is involved in the progression, invasion and metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT). Few studies have reported the correlation between Kif2a and apoptosis of tumor cells and which signaling pathways Kif2a is involved in remains unclear. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway is frequently activated in many types of human cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of downregulation of Kif2 expression on the P13K/Akt pathway in Tca8113 cells to determine whether silencing of Kif2 inhibits the P13K/Akt pathway, resulting in cell apoptosis. siRNA vector was constructed, western blot analysis was used to determine RNA interference and flow cytometry was used to determine promotion of Tca8113 cell apoptosis. The results revealed that silencing Kif2a induces apoptosis and decreases the mRNA and protein level of PI3K, Akt and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in Tca8113 cells. The PI3K-specific agonist insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) eliminated the upregulation of apoptosis of Tca8113-Kif2a cells by phosphorylation of Akt. The results suggest that silencing Kif2a induces tumor cell apoptosis, at least partially, through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

84896137015	Neutrophils infiltration in the tongue squamous cell carcinoma and its correlation with CEACAM1 expression on tumor cells	Objective: The present study aimed to explore the clinical significance of neutrophils infiltration and carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) expression in the tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), and to probe the possible relationship between them. Materials and Methods: Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry were used to detect neutrophils density and CEACAM1 expression in 74 cases of primary TSCC specimens and 17 cases of corresponding peritumoral tissues. The relationship of CEACAM1 expression and neutrophils density with clinicopathologic parameters and cancer-related survival of TSCC patients were evaluated. The correlation between CEACAM1 expression and neutrophils density was also evaluated. Real-time quantitative transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to explore the possible molecular mechanisms between CEACAM1 expression and neutrophils infiltration. Results: Immunohistochemistry evaluation revealed that there was more neutrophils infiltration in TSCC tissues than in peritumoral tissues. High neutrophil density was associated with LN metastasis (P= 0.01), higher clinical stage (P= 0.037) and tumor recurrence ( P= 0.024). CEACAM1 overexpression was also associated with lymph node metastasis (P= 0.000) and higher clinical stage (P= 0.001). Survival analysis revealed that both neutrophils infiltration and CEACAM1 overexpression were associated with poorer cancer-related survival of TSCC patients (P<0.05), and neutrophils infiltration was an independent prognostic factor for TSCC (P<0.05). Furthermore, overexpression of CEACAM1 was correlated with more neutrophils infiltration in TSCC tissues (P< 0.01). qRT-PCR results showed that CEACAM1-4L can upregulate the mRNA expression of IL-8 and CXCL-6, which were strong chemotactic factors of neutrophils. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that more neutrophils infiltration and overexpression of CEACAM1 were associated with poor clinical outcomes in TSCC tissues. Overexpression of CEACAM1 on tumor cells correlated with more neutrophils infiltration to some extent through upregulating mRNA expression of IL-8 and CXCL-6. © 2014 Wang et al.

84897140529	Moraxella catarrhalis adhesin UspA1-derived recombinant fragment rD-7 induces monocyte differentiation to CD14+CD206 + phenotype	Circulating monocytes in the bloodstream typically migrate to other tissues and differentiate into tissue resident macrophages, the process being determined by the constituents of the microenvironments encountered. These may include microbes and their products. In this study, we investigated whether Moraxella catarrhalis Ubiquitous Surface Protein A1 (UspA1), known to bind to a widely expressed human cell surface receptor CEACAM1, influences monocyte differentiation as receptor engagement has been shown to have profound effects on monocytes. We used the recombinant molecules corresponding to the regions of UspA1 which either bind (rD-7; UspA1

84902753378	KIF2A silencing inhibits the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells and correlates with unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer	Background: Kinesin family member 2a (KIF2A), a type of motor protein found in eukaryotic cells, is associated with development and progression of various human cancers. The role of KIF2A during breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression was studied.Methods: Immunohistochemical staining, real time RT-PCR and western blot were used to examine the expression of KIF2A in cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from breast cancer patients. Patients' survival in relation to KIF2A expression was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate analysis. Breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 was used to study the proliferation, migration and invasion of cells following KIF2A-siRNA transfection.Results: The expression of KIF2A in cancer tissues was higher than that in normal adjacent tissues from the same patient (P < 0.05). KIF2A expression in cancer tissue with lymph node metastasis and HER2 positive cancer were higher than that in cancer tissue without (P < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between KIF2A expression levels in breast cancer and the survival time of breast cancer patients (P < 0.05). In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that KIF2A was an independent prognostic for outcome in breast cancer (OR: 16.55, 95% CI: 2.216-123.631, P = 0.006). The proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro were suppressed by KIF2A gene silencing (P < 0.05).Conclusions: KIF2A may play an important role in breast cancer progression and is potentially a novel predictive and prognostic marker for breast cancer. © 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84903775815	Leptin-promoted human extravillous trophoblast invasion is MMP14 dependent andrequires the cross talk between notch1 and PI3k/Akt signaling	The overexpression of leptin is a crucial feature for the maintenance of pregnancy. The effects of leptin on trophoblast invasion are important to its reproductive function, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. MMP14 is a member of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family that is closely involved in the invasion process. Here, we characterized the importance of MMP14 in the proinvasion effect of leptin on EVT cells and elucidated its molecular mechanisms. Transwell assay revealed that leptin promoted invasion of the immortalized EVT cell line HTR-8/SVneo in a dose- and time-related fashion. Further studies suggested that leptin enhanced HTR-8/ SVneo cell invasion by up-regulating MMP14 expression and that knockdown of MMP14 by small interference RNA (siRNA) blocked the proinvasion effect of leptin. Notably, leptin promoted the expression of Notch1 receptor and activated its signaling in HTR-8/SVneo cells, and blocking this pathway by siRNA inhibited both leptin-enhanced MMP14 expression and invasiveness of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Such effects of Notch1 signaling were related with the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which was significantly activated after leptin stimulation and was interfered by Notch1 signaling perturbation. Taken together, our observations suggest that leptin is an effective regulator of MMP14 expression, which consequently plays critical roles in invasion of EVT cells. The promoting effects of leptin on MMP14 require the cross talk between Notch1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. © 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

84905033775	Tumor resident mesenchymal stromal cells endow naïve stromal cells with tumor-promoting properties	Bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) can infiltrate into tumors and subsequently evolve into tumor resident MSCs in tumor microenvironment. In this study, using a mouse lymphoma model, we showed that the lymphoma resident MSCs (L-MSCs) are able to confer tumor-promoting property to the naïve cocultured BM-MSCs. Examination of cytokines and chemokines showed that post exposure to L-MSCs, BM-MSCs acquired an expression profile that is similar to that in L-MSCs. In vivo, BM-MSCs educated by L-MSCs (BM-L-MSCs) possess a greatly enhanced ability in promoting lymphoma growth. Consistent with an elevated CCL-2 expression in BM-L-MSCs, the tumor-promoting effect of BM-L-MSCs largely depends on CCR2-mediated macrophage recruitment to tumor sites. We further showed that the transmission of tumor-promoting effect is partially mediated by soluble factors. Our findings thus revealed a novel reinforcing mechanism in the maintenance of tumor microenvironment. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84907699615	Alterations in the serum proteome profile during the development of ovarian cancer	Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other malignant tumor of the female reproductive system. This is because the condition usually goes undetected until the late stages. The purpose of the present study is to identify alterations in the serum proteome profile during the development of ovarian cancer and to provide an experimental basis for discovering new and valuable serum biomarkers for the early detection of ovarian carcinoma. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF-MS) was used to profile changes in the serum proteome of Fischer 344 rats with ovarian cancer during the progress of tumor development. Sera were collected from the rats on day A (1 week before injection of tumor cells), day B (4 weeks after injection), and day C (6 weeks after injection). Each sample was subjected to SELDI-TOF-MS testing. Peak detection and alignment and selection of peaks with the highest discriminatory power were performed using ProteinChip biomarker software. Decision tree analyses were performed using biomarker pattern software. Finally, 3 peaks were found to be the most valuable ones (3759, 4659 and 9318 Da). The expression frequency of m/z 3759-Da peaks was downregulated and another two frequencies (4659 and 9318 Da) were upregulated, and the levels of expression of these three proteins showed the same tendency as the expression frequency during the development of ovarian cancer. The total accuracy rate of diagnosis at 4 and 6 weeks post-injection was 94.7 and 97.3%, respectively. Profiling the serum proteome changes during the process of the cancer development using SELDI-TOF-MS may provide useful information regarding carcinogenesis and facilitate discovery of novel serum biomarkers for early detection.
