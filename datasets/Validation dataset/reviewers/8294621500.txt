8644253478	Effect of nozzle jet flow on runway stream parameters	When present-day fighter with vector nozzle takes off, the very high temperature and very high velocity of the nozzle jet flow is increasingly damaging to the runway. We presented our research results on the effect of nozzle jet flow on runway stream parameters. Our theoretical study utilizes many well known and mature theoretical tools such as three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, Reynolds-averaged unsteady flow, Baldwin-Lomax algebraic turbulence model, finite volume method and Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes. Our rather extensive but still limited computed results give two preliminary but important conclusions: (1) the highest temperature and the highest velocity of jet flow on the runway occur at points very near each other; (2) the highest temperature on the runway increases rapidly and nearly linearly with increasing vector angle.

14844367052	Experimental research of an axial flow compressor performance with stepped tip gap casing configuration	With the help of an axial flow isolated rotor test rig, a special type of casing treatment with different stepped tip gaps was designed and investigated experimentally for two operating speeds. To compare with the test results for a transonic rotor in Ref. [4] the subsonic operating condition was selected. Seven casing geometries with different step profiles under three varied clearance levels were examined. By comparing the test data, it is known that as the tip clearance level increases the compressor performance and its stability will be deteriorated. For the small clearance level (0.517%h), not only the pre-stall performance but also the post-stall behaviors can be improved significantly when the stepped tip gaps are used. Meanwhile it is found that the axial location and size of the stepped tip gap are also the pivotal parameters affecting the compressor performance and the stall margin improvements. Furthermore, the interesting finding is that for the large clearance level (0.741 %h), the radial depth of the stepped tip gaps, different from the axial width, can only display weak influences on the compressor performance and stability.

15744372262	Experimental and numerical investigation of stepped tip gap effects on an axial-flow compressor	The effects stepped tip gaps on the performance and flow field of a subsonic axial flow compressor rotor were experimentally and numerical investigated. Three different casing configurations were designed and tested on a subsonic axial compressor. Experiments were taken under both 5059 r/min and 8013 r/min conversion speeds. The experimental results showed that the inclusion of stepped tip gaps gave increased pressure ratio, efficiency, and stall margin throughout the mass flow range at both speeds if compared with the baseline case with design tip clearance level. Numerical simulation was performed for the compressor rotor with stepped tip gaps to uncover the complexities of stepped tip gaps flow phenomena.

Tests were conducted under the condition of different axial positions, number of vanes and different length of the casing treatment to define the optimum position. In each case, the characteristics with casing treatment were compared to that with solidwall. The increases of operating efficiency in the flow without drops were observed.

First, calculated results were compared with available experimental data and good agreements are achieved between predicted and experimental values for stages performance of the original compressor. Then, the influence of thickness variation of inlet vane profiles on compressor performance was analyzed. It indicates that the thinner vane profiles are favorable to improving the compressors stage performance. Furthermore, detailed analysis of flow field in the stage explains the reason that stage performance is improved.

27744525597	Axial location of casing treatment in multistage axial flow compressors	Koch in Ref. 1 presented a procedure for estimating the maximum pressure rise potential of axial flow compressor stages. When used in conjunction with a stage stacking off-design performance prediction method, it can indicate which stage is likely to be responsible for stalling a multistage compressor. Based on Koch's approach, it is believed that the casing over the stage that stalls first (critical stage) should be treated in order to prevent or reduce the possibility of stalling. With the help of a two-stage compressor test rig, experimental investigations on the stage stalling and the ideal axial location of the treated casing in the multistage environment were performed using a recessed circumferential slot casing treatment. Experimental results indicate that it is possible to predict the stage that stalls first using Koch's engineering method. In addition, it was verified that if the casing treatment was located over the critical stage, the stall margin of the whole multistage compressor could be improved significantly.

27744527296	The effects of stepped tip gap on performance and flowfield of a subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor	This paper investigates the flow field at the tip region of compressor rotor. In particular, the effect of stepped tip gaps on the performance and flowfield of an axial-flow compressor rotor was reviewed using both experimental and computational methods. An axial compressor rotor with no inlet guide vanes was tested under subsonic condition. A parametric study of clearance levels and step profiles was performed using eight different casing geometries. This study was aimed at comparing compressor performance in specified configurations. The experimental results showed that the inclusion of stepped tip gaps with the small clearance level gave increased pressure ratio, efficiency, and stall margin throughout the mass flow range at both speeds. However, when using medium and large clearance level, the benefits of stepped tip gaps were not noticed for all rotor operating conditions if compared with the baseline case. Steady-state Navier-Stokes analyses were performed for cases involving small clearance level and stepped tip gap geometries. They highlighted the mechanisms associated with performance improvement. The numerical procedure correctly predicted the overall effects of stepped tip gaps. Detailed numerical simulation results showed that the interaction between the stepped groove flow and blade passage flow could entrain the blockage produced by upstream tip leakage flow into the tip gap of adjacent blades of the compressor rotor. It is through this process that stepped tip gaps can help dissipating blockage that was caused by upstream tip leakage flow. Thus the path and extent of the blockage in the tip region is altered to increase the passage throughflow area and so, the rotor performance can be improved. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.

3042802226	Effects of asymmetric tip clearance on axial flow compressor performance	Asymmetry of rotor tip clearance in compressors always exists to some extent. To investigate the effects of rotor tip clearance asymmetry on compressor performances, a series of axially-asymmetric tip clearance casing configurations were designed and experimented on a low speed, axial flow compressor with a single rotor. For each geometry, experiments were taken under both 5059 r/min and 8130 r/min conversion velocities. According to the experiments, several phenomena have been observed: (1) With the increase of asymmetric tip clearance, the stall points on compressor performance curves shift to the lower right, compared with the solid casing and symmetric tip clearance. To evaluate such shifting effects quantitatively, two parameters were defined. (2) With the increase of asymmetric tip clearance, the average stall performance is also decreased. (3) On the other hand, however, the size of the stall-unstall hysteresis loops on the performance map decrease with the increase of the asymmetric tip clearance, which shows that it is easier for the compressor to recover from stall. As a whole, the experimental results show that, such treated casings are detrimental to the compressor performances.

30744477023	The effects of bend skewed groove casing treatment on performance and flow field near endwall of an axial compressor	A new type of bend skewed groove casing treatment was designed based on the test results of the axial skewed groove casing treatment. The influences of utilizing it to an isolated axial flow rotor, as well as comparisons between it and the axial skewed groove, have been investigated experimentally. The effects on overall performance of the axial chord of the rotor exposed to the treated area have been examined and the ideal axial position of the casing treatment relative to the rotor leading edge was found. For the tested rotor with the new casing treatment, experimental results showed that significant improvements in stall margin were observed without efficiency penalty (in some axial locations) at two different speeds. Compared with the axial skewed groove casing treatment, the new treated casing at the axial exposure do not increase the secondary circulation in the radial-circumferential plane based on the cross hot-wire measurements under the operating condition of near peak efficiency. This can be considered to be one of many factors that keep the rotor efficiency identical. Copyright © 2005 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.

33645903873	Analysis of the coupled flow through axial skewed slots casing treatment and rotor passage	Axial skewed slot casing treatment is known as a powerful method to improve the stall margin of compressor. A time accurate 3-dimentional numerical simulation of the coupled flow through a subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor passage and axial skewed slots casing treatment was presented in this paper. The numerical results agreed well with experimental test data for estimation of the global performance. The different tip flow topology of the compressor rotor with axial skewed slots casing treatment and the unsteady interaction between rotor passage and axial skewed slots casing treatment were detailed analyzed. The numerical results showed that the control of the high loss, high blockage tip leakage flow and its vortex is the basic mechanism which are responsible for the stabilizing impact of casing treatments.

33646354176	Numerical and experimental investigations of the flow in a compressor with circumferential grooves	Numerical and Experimental investigations were conducted to study the effect of circumferential grooves on the performance and flowfield of an axial-flow compressor rotor. A single-stage compressor rotor with no inlet guide vanes was tested under subsonic condition. Circumferential grooves as well as the original smooth wall configuration were analyzed to investigate the effects of circumferential grooves on compressor performance. The result shows that circumferential grooves are able to effectively extend the stall margin of the compressor with little influence on efficiency throughout the mass flow range tested. Steady-state Navier-Stokes analysis were performed to analyze flow structures associated with each casing treatment. The overall effects of circumferential grooves were correctly calculated with the numerical procedure. Detailed investigation of the calculated flow fields indicates that the key mechanism lay to the interaction with the tip leakage. Taking advantage of the existing pressure difference in the rotor blade row, circumferential grooves remove tip leakage flow in the high pressure zone and weaken or even destroy the structure of tip leakage vortex. At the same time the tip leakage reenters the main flow in the low pressure zones again and mixes with the main flow of the compressor, thus circumferential grooves influence the efficiency and stall margin of the compressor.

Numerical analysis was carried out to investigate the influence of tip clearance on the flow-field in a compressor cascade with a moving end-wall.

Moreover, on the basis of having achieved a relatively good agreement with the already available test data, a detailed numerical analysis is performed of its inner flow field, which confirms that inside the oblique flow impellers, there also exist classic jet-flow wake patterns specific to a centrifugal impeller. The research results show that due to a highly nonsymmetrical nature of the volute housing, the jet flow-wake inside various impellers also features totally different patterns. A further study indicates that the basic reason leading to the emergence of this phenomenon lies in the presence of a nonsymmetrical volute housing, which changes the blade-tip leakage flow at the top of the impellers.

The effects on overall performance of the axial chord of the rotor exposed to the treated area have been examined, and the ideal axial position of the casing treatment relative to the rotor leading edge was found. For the tested rotor with the new casing treatment, experimental results showed that significant improvements in stall margin were observed without efficiency penalty (in some axial locations) at two different speeds. Compared with the axial skewed groove casing treatment, the new treated casing at the axial exposure does not increase the secondary circulation in the radial- circumferential plane based on x-wire, hot-wire measurements under the operating conditions near peak efficiency. This can be considered to be one of many factors that keep the rotor efficiency identical. © IMechE 2006.

33846150708	Numerical investigation of interaction between casing treatment and tip leakage flow in a transonic compressor rotor	Tip leakage flow has a strong effect on the transonic compressor performance and stability. Based on improved understanding of compressor rotor tip clearance flow, a new type of casing treatment was designed for a transonic axial-flow compressor rotor and numerical simulation of three-dimensional unsteady flow in the compressor rotor was carried out to verify the designed casing treatment. The numerical results (smooth wall case) agreed well with our experimental test data for estimation of the global performance, and this new type of casing treatment was found to increase the compressor stall margin by up to 52% without loss in efficiency at design point. The interaction mechanism between the casing treatment and tip leakage flow was analyzed in detail. It is found that the casing treatment could delay the tip leakage vortex breakdown and bleed the blockage zone caused by the tip leakage vortex breakdown into treatment slots, and therefore extend the stall margin of transonic compressor effectively.

In addition, three-dimensional flow analysis was carried out to verify the performance improvement of the newly optimized support strut.

Then, the numerically obtained flow fields are analyzed to identify the role of the detailed flow structures near the tip region of the rotor and stator on the compressor aerodynamics.

33846205186	Experimental and numerical investigation of a subsonic compressor with bend-skewed slot-casing treatment	On the basis of the test results of discrete axial and blade angle slot casing treatment, a new type of casing treatment was designed for a subsonic axial flow compressor rotor by optimizing various geometry parameters. To obtain a wide operating range and to minimize penalties in terms of isentropic efficiency, seven compressor configurations incorporating casing treatments of 0, 16.6, 33.3, 50, 66.6, 83.3, and 100 per cent rotor exposures were experimentally investigated. The results showed that significant improvements in stall margin are possible in all exposures and insignificant isentropic efficiency sacrifices are recorded in some exposures. Nearly 21.43 per cent stall margin improvement in terms of the corrected mass flow-rate was achieved with 33.3 per cent rotor blade tip axial chord exposure. The compressor built with 16.6 per cent rotor exposure was the best configuration in terms of maximum isentropic efficiency gain. The second issue of the paper was to offer a contribution to the understanding of the physical mechanism by which bend-skewed slot-casing treatment improves stall margin under subsonic conditions. By applying a concept similar to 'Domain scaling' approach (as often used in multistage turbomachinery flow-fields) to the interface between the rotor blade passage and end-wall treatments, a time-dependent three-dimensional numerical simulation was performed for the subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor with bend-skewed slot-casing treatment. The numerical results agreed well with the available experimental results. Detailed analyses of the coupled flow through bend-skewed slot-casing treatment and rotor blade passage under subsonic conditions led to some preliminary conclusions as to the flow physics involved in the stall margin improvements afforded by the use of bend-skewed slot-casing treatment. © IMechE 2006.

The primary parameters of the compressor are revealed. The numerical results indicate that the stage is endowed with steep working characteristics. In the whole flow range, the impeller operates under subsonic condition and the radial diffuser operates under transonic condition, thus the choked mass flow rate is determined by the throat area of the radial diffuser. The interactions between different through-flow parts (impeller, radial diffuser, axial diffuser) exert significant influence on the flow in the two diffusers and result in a bigger separation range near hub elements, which dominate the performance and stability during the whole stage.

33846908118	Mechanism of axial-flow compressor stall margin improvement associated with bend skewed slots casing treatment	The bend skewed slot casing treatment has the potential to significantly extend the stall margin of the compressor with minimal or no loss in efficiency. In order to uncover the working mechanism by which bend skewed slots casing treatments improve stall margin and also the flow mechanisms the bend skewed slots casing treatments differ from axial skewed slots casing treatment, a time accurate 3-dimentional numerical simulation was performed for the subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor both with bend skewed slot casing treatment and axial skewed slot casing treatment. The numerical results agreed well with experimental data for the global performance. Detailed analyses of the flow visualization at the tip have exposed the different tip flow topologies between the cases with casing treatment and with untreated smooth wall. It was found that the repositioning of the tip vortex trajectory further towards the trailing edge of the blade passage and delaying the movement of incoming/tip clearance flow interface to the leading edge plane are the exact mechanism of stall suppression imposed by bend skewed slot casing treatment.

The effect of tip injection on the performance of an axial-flow compressor was performed numerically. The numerical results of smooth wall agreed well with experimental data for the global performance of smooth wall. The injective numerical results showed that the injection of upstream near the rotor leading 30% axial chord edge can suspend the stall.

33947678183	Numerical and experimental investigations of steady micro-tip injection on a subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor	Steady tip injection has been demonstrated to be an effective means of extending the stable operating range of a tip-critical compressor. This study presents a state-of-the-art design for the tip injection through the casing with flush-mounted inclined holes and the effectiveness of steady micro-air injection to enhance stability in a subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor using an external-air supply. For the tested rotor, experimental results demonstrate that at 53% design speed, the stalling mass flow can be reduced by 7.69% using an injected mass flow equivalent to 0.064% of the annulus flow. Time-dependent CFD simulations were conducted to identify the physical mechanic that accounts for the beneficial effects of the steady micro-air injection on the performance and stability of the compressor. Detailed analyses of the flow visualization at the tip have exposed the different tip flow topologies between the cases without tip injection and with tip injection. It was found that the primary stall margin enhancement afforded by the steady micro-air injection is a result of thetip-clearance flow manipulation. The repositioning of the tip-clearance vortex further towards the trailing edge of the blade passage and delaying the movement of incoming/ tip-clearance flow interface to the leading edge plane are the physical mechanisms responsible for extending the compressor stall margin.

34047109833	Behaviour of tip-leakage flow in an axial flow compressor rotor	The current paper reports on investigations with an aim to advance the understanding of the flowfield near the casing of a small-scale high-speed axial flow compressor rotor. Steady three-dimensional viscous flow calculations are applied to obtain flowfields at various operating conditions. To demonstrate the validity of the computation, the numerical results are first compared with available measured data. Then, the numerically obtained flowfields are analysed to identify the behaviour of tip-leakage flow, and the mechanism of blockage generation arising from flow interactions between the tip clearance flow, the blade/ casing wall boundary layers, and non-uniform main flow. The current investigation indicates that the 'breakdown' of the tip-leakage vortex occurs inside the rotor passage at the near stall condition. The vortex 'breakdown' results in the low-energy fluid accumulating on the casing wall spreads out remarkably, which causes a sudden growth of the casing wall boundary layer having a large blockage effect. A low-velocity region develops along the tip clearance vortex at the near stall condition due to the vortex 'breakdown'. As the mass flow rate is further decreased, this area builds up rapidly and moves upstream. This area prevents incoming flow from passing through the pressure side of the passage and forces the tip-leakage flow to spill into the adjacent blade passage from the pressure side at the leading edge. It is found that the tip-leakage flow exerts a little influence on the development of the blade suction surface boundary layer even at the near stall condition. © IMechE 2007.

34250714878	Numerical investigations of the flow mechanisms in a subsonic compressor rotor with axial-skewed slot	By applying a concept similar to 'domain scaling' treatment often used in multi-stage turbomachinery flow field to the interface between the rotor blade passage and end-wall treatments, a series of computational studies were carried out to understand the physical mechanism responsible for improvement in stall margin of a modern subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor due to the axial-skewed slot casing treatment. Particular attention was given to examining the interaction between the rotor tip flow and the axial-skewed slot. In order to validate the multi-block model applied in the rotor blade end-wall region, the computational results for the modern subsonic compressor rotor both with and without axial-skewed slot casing treatment were correlated with available experimental test data. The computed results agree fairly well with the experimental data, and the computations are then used to describe the interaction between the rotor tip flow and axial-skewed slot. Detailed analyses of the flow visualization at the tip have exposed the different tip flow topologies between the cases with axial-skewed slot and with untreated smooth wall. It was found that the primary stall margin enhancement afforded by the axial-skewed slot casing treatment is a result of the tip flow manipulation. The repositioning of the tip vortex trajectory further towards the trailing edge of the blade passage and delaying the movement of incoming/tip clearance flow interface to the leading edge plane are the physical mechanisms responsible for extending the compressor stall margin. © IMechE 2007.

Three-dimentional numerical simulation has been performed for a subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor both with the blowing circumferential grooved casing treatment and archetypal casing treatment. The calculated overall performance lines showed good agreement with the experiments.

34547744831	Comparison of circumferential slot with stepped clearance structure in a single-stage axial-flow compressor	After the reliability of a calculation model has been verified, a numerical simulation for a single-stage subsonic axial-flow compressor was conducted of the working characteristics of a real wall casing, circumferential slot one and stepped clearance structure under the condition of 71% design speed. The simulation results show that both the circumferential slot casing and stepped clearance structure can enlarge the compressor stable operating range to a certain extent. However, the circumferential slot plays a more explicit role in controlling the blade tip leakage vortexes in the blade leading edge, thus making it more suitable to be designed at the front half portion of a blade flow passage. The stepped clearance structure can fulfil its due function of diffusion stabilization when located in both the front and rear half portion of the blade flow passage. When the above structure is allocated in the leading edge of a blade, the compressor will suffer a relatively large drop in efficiency. In case the clearance structure is located in the blade trailing edge, it can contribute to a reduction of the area of the separation zone in the blade wake, thus playing a beneficial role in enhancing compressor efficiency.

38949166094	Effects of tip clearance size on tip leakage flow fields in a subsonic compressor rotor	This paper aims at the numerical analysis of the influence of tip clearance size on aerodynamics in a subsonic tip critical compressor rotor. We make use of well known methods of numerical analysis, including NUMECA Fine/Turbo module, to obtain tip clearance flow fields, which are shown in Figs. 3 through 7 in the full paper. We analyze these figures to identify the effects of the tip clearance size on the behavior of tip leakage vortex, which is closely related to the performance characteristic of the rotor. We find that tip leakage vortex breaks down in all investigated cases. The vortex 'breakdown' causes a sudden growth of the casing-wall boundary layer, which has a large blockage effect on incoming flow. Under the same downstream conditions, the vortex breakdown occurs earliest in the case of the largest tip clearance size. This verifies that the strength of leakage vortex is one of the major factors influencing the vortex breakdown.

33644951360	Detailed structure of tip clearance flow in an isolated axial flow compressor rotor and its effect on compressor performance	Experiments up to now cannot reveal completely the structure of tip clearance flow. Our aim is to study theoretically this detailed structure and its important effect on performance of an isolated axial flow compressor rotor. Experimental and numerical investigations were carried out. We used well-known theoretical methods and numerical simulation to study the above-mentioned detailed structure. At NPU Department of Aeroengines we have engaged in aeroengine research, both theoretical and experimental, for many years; so we need not say anything about our normal experimental procedure in this paper other than stating that we have done considerable contract experimental research for Roll-Royce plc. We arranged our experimental setup in such a way as to make it an isolated axial compressor rotor. For such rotor, the calculated results were compared with experimental data and good agreement was achieved between predicted and experimental values all along the spanwise direction of the rotor blade except in the neighborhood of the casing, where it was almost impossible to make measurements experimentally. Near the casing the theoretically calculated total pressure changes very rapidly. Such abrupt change affects very much the performance of axial-compressor rotor.

84861504716	Investigation of Pre-Stall Behavior in an Axial Compressor Rotor-Part I: Unsteadiness of Tip Clearance Flow	To investigate the pre-stall behavior of an axial flow compressor rotor, which was experimentally observed with spike-type stall inception, systematic experimental and whole-passage simulations were laid out to analyze the internal flow fields in the test rotor. In this part, emphases were put on the analyses of experimental results and the predicted results from steady simulations and unsteady simulations, which converged to equilibrium solutions with nearly periodic fluctuations of efficiency. The objective was to uncover the unsteady behavior of tip clearance flow and its associated flow mechanism at near-stall conditions. To validate the steady simulation results, the predicted total characteristics and spanwise distributions of aerodynamic parameters were first compared with the measured steady data, and a good agreement was achieved. Then, the numerically obtained unsteady flow fields during one period of efficiency fluctuations were analyzed in detail. The instantaneous flow structure near casing showed that tip secondary vortex (TSV), which appeared in the previous unsteady single-passage simulations, did exist in tip flow fields of whole-passage simulations. The cyclical motion of this vortex was the main source of the nearly periodic variation of efficiency. The simulated active period of TSV increased when the mass flow rate decreased. The simulated frequency of TSV at flow condition very close to the measured stall point equaled the frequency of the characteristic hump identified from the instantaneous casing pressure measurements. This coincidence implied that the occurrence of this hump was most probably a result of the movement of TSV. Further flow field analyses indicated that the interaction of the low-energy leakage fluid from adjacent passages with the broken-down tip leakage vortex (TLV) was the flow mechanism for the formation of TSV. Once TSV appeared in tip flow fields, its rearward movement would lead to a periodic variation in near-tip blade loading, which in turn altered the strength of TLV and TSV, accordingly, the low-energy regions associated with the breakdown of TLV and the motion of TSV, thus establishing a self-sustained unsteady flow oscillation in tip flow fields. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

84861929767	Investigation of Pre-Stall Behavior in an Axial Compressor Rotor-Part II: Flow Mechanism of Spike Emergence	To investigate the pre-stall behavior of an axial flow compressor rotor, which was experimentally observed with spike-type stall inception, systematic experimental and whole-passage simulations were laid out to analyze the internal flow fields in the test rotor. In this part, emphases were put on the analyses of the flow fields of whole-passage simulation, which finally diverged, and the objective was to uncover the flow mechanism of short length scale disturbance (or spike) emergence. The numerical result demonstrated that the test rotor was of spike-type stall initiation. The numerical probes, arranged ahead of the rotor to monitor the static pressure variation, showed that there first appear two pips on the curves. After one rotor revolution, there was only one pip left, spreading at about 33.3% rotor speed. This propagation speed was almost the same as that of the spike observed in experiments. The further analysis of the flow field revealed a concentrated blockage sector on the flow annuls ahead of rotor developed gradually with the self-adjustment of flow fields. The two pins on monitoring curves corresponded to two local blockage regions in near-tip passages, and were designated as B1 and B2, respectively. The correlation between the tip secondary vortices (TSVs) in the preceding and native passages was the flow mechanism for propagation of B2 and B1, thereby leading to their spread speed approximate to the active period of the TSV in one passage. Furthermore, the self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSVs was the underlying flow mechanism for the occurrence of the so-called "tip clearance spillage flow" and "tip clearance backflow." Because B2 was the tip-front of the blockage sector, TSVs associated with its propagation became stronger and stronger, so that the "tip clearance backflow" induced by it was capable of spilling into the next passage below the blade tip. This phenomenon was regarded as the threshold event where B2 started to evolve into a spike. The distinctive flow feature during the development stage of the spike was the occurrence of a separation focus on the suction side in the affected passages, which changed the self-sustained unsteady cycle of the TSV substantially. A three-dimensional vortex originating from this focus led to a drastic increase in the strength of the TSV, which, in turn, led to a rapid increase in the "tip clearance backflow" induced by the TSV and the radial extent of spillage flow. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

46449139759	Role of leakage vortex behavior on stall inception in an axial compressor rotor	Steady and time-accurate three dimensional viscous flow calculations are applied to look deep into the steady and unsteady natures of tip leakage flow in a small-scale high-speed axial compressor rotor. Steady numerical simulations indicate that the breakdown of tip leakage vortex occurs inside the rotor passage at near stall condition. The vortex breakdown results in the low-energy fluid accumulating on the casing wall spreads out remarkably, which has a large blockage effect on incoming flow. Time-accurate simulations verify that leakage vortex breaks down massively as the mass flow rate decreases. The resultant low-velocity area builds up rapidly and moves towards pressure side and upstream until the unsteady equilibrium solution limit. At this point, the interaction of the massive vortex breakdown with the blade suction boundary layer occurs, and the low energy fluid in the blade suction boundary layer is rolled up into the leakage vortex, which further intensifies the blockage of tip blade passage.

46149112406	A study of the stall control involved in the casing treatment of a centrifugal compressor with recessed guide vanes	The authors have conducted an accurate time-variant three-dimensional numerical simulation with respect to a new type casing treatment structure that can remarkably improve the stability margin of the original compressor. A detailed comparison and analysis was performed of the flow fields in the blade tip region of a centrifugal compressor with a solid-wall casing structure and recessed guide vane type of casing treatment structure. The meridian speed distribution inside the blade passages in the radial direction is also analyzed, thus revealing the diffusion stabilization mechanism of the casing treatment structure with recessed guide vanes. An analysis of the calculation results of casing treatment with recessed guide vanes of different parameters shows that the increase in the axial overlapping amount is favorable for improving the stability margin of the compressor but unfavorable for enhancing its efficiency. The decrease of the groove depth will somehow improve the stability margin of the compressor. The total pressure ratios at both the peak and the stall point, however, will be somewhat reduced.

48549083383	Influences of axial positions of grooved casing treatment on stall margin improvement	Experimental and numerical investigations were conducted to study the effects of axial positions of circumferential grooved casing treatment on compressor performance. Experiments of three different axial positions of circumferential grooved casing treatment were performed in a subsonic rotor. The experimental results show that three axial positions of groove casing treatment extend the steady operating range of the compressor at two rotating speeds. Groove with unchanged axial position has the best effect in extending the steady operating range, followed by the backward axial position moving. The calculated overall tendency for stall margin improvement fitted well with the experiment. The fundamental flow mechanism was obtained by in-depth analysis of the flow-filed at the blade tip, based on the effect of circumferential grooved casing position on the compressor performance.

Three grooved widths of a circumferential grooved casing are tested in a subsonic rotor. Experimental results show that all the three groove widths of the grooved casing treatment increase the stall margin of the compressor. The narrow groove has the best effect on increasing the stable operating range while the effect of the two wider grooves is less satisfactory. The calculated overall performance lines show good agreement with the results of the experiment. The fundamental flow mechanism is obtained by a detailed analysis of the flow field at the blade tip, which indicates how the groove width of circumferential-grooved casing treatment affects compressor performance.

53649108987	Exploring mechanism of flow instability and stall margin enhancement of a subsonic axial-flow compressor due to casing treatment	The role of complex tip flow mechanisms on flow instability in a subsonic axial-flow compressors has been assessed using time-accurate single blade passage computations and experimental measurement. Systematic studies of the coupled flow through a subsonic compressor rotor and two various end-wall treatments were carried out using state-of-the-art multi-block flow solver. Detailed analyses of the flow visualization at the rotor tip have exposed the different tip flow topologies between the cases with treatment casing and with untreated smooth wall. It was found that the blockage zone which is positioned about pressure side of adjacent blade play an essential role on the loss flow instability, this area is mainly a result of the motion of the tip leakage vortex moving upstream of the rotor passage as the mass flow rate decreases for the subsonic axial-flow compressor. Compared to the smooth wall case, the treated casing significantly dampen or absorb the blockage near the upstream part of the blade passage caused by the upstream movement of tip leakage flow and weakens the roll-up of the core vortex. These mechanisms prevent an early spillage of low momentum fluid into the adjacent blade passage, therefore delay the onset of rotating stall.

54049110451	Study of the clearance leakage flow characteristics of a transonic axial-flow compressor	Clearance leakage flow exercises a major influence on the formation of rotating stall of an axial flow compressor. The authors have conducted a single-passage and multi-passage non-steady numerical simulation by utilizing the transonic axial-flow compressor of NASA rotor 37. The single-passage non-steady calculation results reveal that at an operating condition approximating to compressor stalling speed, there exists a clearance leakage-flow self non-steady behavior at the blade tip. In addition, the non-steady simulation results under two different back-pressure conditions have been compared. When the back pressure at the outlet is comparatively high, the unsteady behavior of the clearance leakage flow is extremely unstable. When the back pressure at the outlet is relatively low, the above-mentioned unsteady behavior is stable. The multi-passage non-steady numerical simulation results indicate that at an operating condition approximating to the stalling speed, when the outlet back pressure is comparatively high, the clearance leakage flow will oscillate unsteadily, triggering the inception of a spike type rotating stall and resulting in a concrete embodiment of overflow from the blade tip leakage at the leading edge. However, when the outlet back pressure is relatively low, the unsteady behavior of the clearance leakage flow has all along been relatively stable.

Experimental results show all grooved numbers of groove casing treatment increase the stall margin of the compressor. The maximum grooved number has the best effect in increasing the stable operating range. The least grooved number has inferior effect in improving the stable operating range. The calculated overall performance lines showed good agreement with the experiments.

58249130457	An optimization method based on design of experiments and its application to centrifugal pumps	Many existing optimization methods have inherent limitations which cannot be overcome. For traditional methods, the global optimization values are often outside the searching domain; for recent methods, such as genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, their computation efficiency is very low. In an attempt to find a method that does not have such inherent limitations, we present an optimization method based on Design of Experiments (DOE) and approximation model method. The first step of this optimization method is to set up a DOE-guided database. Once the database is set up, approximation model fitting technique is used to build an approximation model for independent variables and dependent variables. Finally, numerical optimization method is used to obtain the optimal solution for this optimization model. This new optimization method is applied to optimizing centrifugal impellers. Results show that this method is very efficient and accurate.

For compressor rotor being studied, the performance of the nonaxisymmetric casing was compared with the circumferential grooved casing, and the slotted casing. Result shows, due to its effectively utilizing of the local favorable pressure gradient, and its smooth contour, the nonaxisymmetric casing can improve the rotor stall margin without sacrifice its performance.

61949102109	Numerical simulation of effect of inlet total-pressure distortion on subsonic axial-flow compressor	3-D steady and unsteady numerical simulations of the effect on the subsonic axial-flow compressor with the three types of circumferential total-pressure distortion of 1 × 120°, 2 × 60° and 5 × 24° have been performed in the full paper. Detailed analyses of the flow field inside the compressor rotor help to draw the following preliminary conclusions: the circumferential total-pressure distortion exerts small effect on the performance of the compressor rotor but has more effect on its stall margin. The loss of stall margin for 1 × 120° circumferential total-pressure distortion is as tremendous as about 7%, while those for 2 × 60° and 5 × 24° ones are about 3% and 1.5% respectively. At the boundary between distortion area and non-distortion area, there exists apparent circumferential flow, and its direction is from non-distortion area to distortion area. The load on the rotor blade decreases when the rotor blade enters the distortion area. However, the load increases when the rotor blade goes away from it. The circumferential inlet total-pressure distortion reduces the chock mass flow and causes total-temperature distortion at the outlet.

69249143306	Influence of blade tip cutting on axial compressor aerodynamic performance	The purpose of this article is to numerically investigate the function of blade tip cutting on axial flow compressors. The subject of this article is a subsonic compressor stage built and tested by Northwest Polytechnic University. The effect of cutting material from the blade pressure side is first analysed as an isolated rotor, and then in the environment of a stage with a downstream stator. The tool used for simulation is commercial computational fluid dynamics package of NUMECA. The numerical results show the possibility of increasing the rotor/stage pressure ratio and improve rotor efficiency by finding the right cut. The most significant effect of blade tip cutting is that it redistributes the load along blade span. When the adjusted load shape now fits with the downstream stator, the advantage of blade tip cut can be magnified; on the contrary, if the shape is not compatible with the downstream load, then the configuration that favours the performance of the rotor may deteriorate than that of the stage. This study also indicates that the blade tip cutting technique is rather case-dependent and that the performance of the cut blade is very sensitive to the shape of blade leading edge. Positive effect will only be significant when the cut is tailored to benefit both the local rotor flow field and the downstream flow field. © 2009 IMechE.

69249154751	Numerical investigations of the coupled flow through a subsonic compressor rotor and axial skewed slot	In order to advance the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of axial skewed slot casing treatment and their effects on the subsonic axial-flow compressor flow field, the coupled unsteady flow through a subsonic compressor rotor and the axial skewed slot was simulated with a state-of-the-art multiblock flow solver. The computational results were first compared with available measured data, that showed the numerical procedure calculates the overall effect of the axial skewed slot correctly. Then, the numerically obtained flow fields were interrogated to identify the physical mechanism responsible for improvement in stall margin of a modern subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor due to the discrete skewed slots. It was found that the axial skewed slot casing treatment can increase the stall margin of subsonic compressor by repositioning of the tip clearance flow trajectory further toward the trailing of the blade passage and retarding the movement of the incoming/tip clearance flow interface toward the rotor leading edge plane.

By using a parallel calculation technology, numerically simulated was the flow field of the whole machine, including the casing treatment structure and volute housing of the impeller, revealing the mechanism governing the stability enhancement achieved by the casing treatment. The low-energy fluid in the area of the blade tip was sucked into the treatment slot by the casing treatment structure, flowed out of the circumferential slot in the area at the suction surface side inside the blade passage and jetted into the rotor passage, thus eliminating the blockage caused by the low-energy air mass in the area, improving the air flow status at the blade tip of the rotor and delaying stall occurrence.

It formed below the rotor blade tip section and propagated diagonally inward. This vortex propagated across the rotor passage from the pressure side to the suction side with its vortex core filled with low-energy fluid. The spike emergence during stall inception included the breakdown of the tip leakage vortex and the formation and movement of the tip separation vortex.

77953253329	Further numerical investigation of optimum structure of axial slot casing treatment on a two-stage transonic fan	This paper is another small step forward in NWPU (Northwestern Polytechnical University) long-standing research on improving axial slot casing treatment. The numerical investigation of the optimum structure of axial slot casing treatment is performed on a high rotating speed and high load two-stage transonic fan. Section 1 of the full paper explains our new ideas on optimizing the axial slot casing treatment; in particular, in addition to the original optimum structure, we propose three new structures, which we call structures No.1, No.2 and No.3. Section 2 briefs the numerical calculation method which we have been using. Section 3 presents numerically calculated results, given in Figs. 2 through 6 and Table 1, and their analysis, which show preliminarily that: (1) the three new casings have no capacity for extending the operating range of the fan under transonic condition, and this is consistent with the experimental and calculated results of the original casing; (2) the stall margin improvement is higher with the structures No. 2 and No. 3 of the new casing treatment than with the original casing treatment under subsonic condition; the mechanism of extending the stall margin under subsonic condition is explored with detailed analysis of flow-field in the fan as given in Figs. 4 through 6; the extension of the treated area of casing structure No.2 increases the ability of bleeding or blowing blade tip low energy flow mass, thus improving the flow capacity near tip passage; (3) because the structure No.3 uses the pressure difference better than structure No.2, its stall margin improvement is further increased with the accompanying improvement of the fan performance; the compressor efficiency is higher with No.3 casing treatment than with No.2 casing treatment as shown by the results in Fig.3.

77953256789	Mechanism of stall margin improvement of two stages transonic fan with two-portion axial slot casing treatment	The mechanism of stall margin improvement is investigated on a high rotating speed and high load two-stage transonic compressor with two-portion axial slot casing treatment by 3D numerical simulation. The calculated overall performance curves good agree well with the experiments. The results show that the stable operating range is extended with two-portion axial slot casing treatment in the subsonic condition. The detailed analysis of the calculated flow-filed at the blade tip shows that the separation of the rotor blade suction boundary of the first stage cause blockage in the blade tip passage, which is the primary reason for compressor stall in the subsonic condition. Back flow come into being in the slots by pressure difference, which makes low energy air mass of blade tip enter slot or transport the low energy of slot downstream to slot upstream. The low energy air mass is accelerated by pressure difference during transportation and it turns into mainstream again at the slot upstream. This kind of flow manner can inspirit the low energy air mass of blade tip near end wall and extend the stable operating range of transonic compressor in the subsonic condition effectively.

Effect of self recirculation casing treatment on the performance and flow field of NASA axial Rotor37 is performed with unsteady numerical method to explore the mechanism of self recirculation casing treatment affecting the performance and flow field of transonic compressor. The numerical results show that self recirculation casing treatment not only can suspend the stall effectively but also improve the compressor efficiency appreciably in the range of flow rate studied. The detailed analysis of the flow field at the blade tip shows that the magnitudes of flow inlet angle is increased and the development of tip leakage vortex is restrained with self recirculation casing treatment, which can prevent he breakdown of the clearance leakage vortex and improve effectively the current ability of blade tip passage. As the result, the loss of rotor tip area is receded.

77956252492	Numerical investigation of the unsteady tip leakage flow and rotating stall inception in a transonic compressor	It is well known that tip leakage flow has a strong effect on the compressor performance and stability. This paper reports on a numerical investigation of detailed flow structures in an isolated transonic compressor rotor-NASA Rotor 37 at near stall and stalled conditions aimed at improving understanding of changes in 3D tip leakage flow structures with rotating stall inception. Steady and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes analyses were conducted to investigate flow structures in the same rotor. For steady analysis, the predicted results agree well with the experimental data for the estimation of compressor rotor global performance. For unsteady flow analysis, the unsteady flow nature caused by the breakdown of the tip leakage vortex in blade tip region in the transonic compressor rotor at near stall condition has been captured with a single blade passage. On the other hand, the time-accurate unsteady computations of multi-blade passage at near stall condition indicate that the unsteady breakdown of the tip leakage vortex triggered the short length-scale - spike type rotating stall inception at blade tip region. It was the forward spillage of the tip leakage flow at blade leading edge resulting in the spike stall inception. As the mass flow ratio is decreased, the rotating stall cell was further developed in the blade passage. © 2010 Science Press and Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77956002298	Influence of shock/tip leakage vortex interaction on flow stability in a single-stage transonic axial compressor	Three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the flow field in a single-stage transonic compressor Stage 35. Firstly, three kinds of gridding were modeled to investigate their prediction accuracy on overall performance and blade-element curves. The criterion for choosing the optimum gridding is that the prediction matches best the experimental data. Then, the internal flow filed of the optimum gridding was analyzed to find out the most probable influential factor of the flow stability; and it is found that low-energy fluid near pressure surface at rotor tip most likely induces the flow instability. As the mass flow rate reduces, the intensity and swirl ratio of the tip leakage vortex (TLV) increase with the blade loading. The breakdown of the TLV occurs due to the interaction of shock/TLV at the near-stall condition, thus most possibly leading to low-energy fluid accumulated near the pressure side of rotor tip passage.

77956021416	Numerical and experimental research of stall inception on subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor	Three-dimensional flow simulation and blade tip high-response static pressure measurements were performed on an isolated subsonic compressor rotor to gain more insight into the stall inception mechanism of the compressors. The Navier-Stokes solver, EURANUS, was used for computation. The steady-state flow solution was achieved at the convergence of a four-stage explicit Runge-Kutta integration scheme. The time-dependent calculation was implemented in the implicit dual time stepping scheme, which allowed for the solution of a steady-state problem at each physical time step. The high-response static pressure was measured using five Kulite sensors installed on the casing. The data acquisition frequency was 100 kHz. The recorded data were later analysed using wavelet analysis method. Correlating the simulation result and the measurement result, it was shown that as the compressor was approaching the near stall (NS) condition, the tip leakage vortex dissipation and shedding became violent. The shedding or dissipated flow structures would consequently scatter around the blade tip passage, which formed the initial onset of stall disturbances. These scattered vortexes would finally lead to compressor stall as they hit and merge with each other into low-frequency disturbance of significant size and energy. A stall pre-alarming method based on the monitoring of the low-frequency spectrum power at the NS condition was also suggested by this study.

78149437355	The influence of tip clearance size on axial compressor rotor aerodynamics	This paper aims at the numerical analysis of the influence of tip clearance size on aerodynamics in a subsonic high-speed small-scale compressor rotor. The numerical results are firstly compared with the available experimental data to demonstrate the validity of the computations. Then, numerically obtained flow fields are analyzed to identify the effects of the tip clearance size on the behavior of tip leakage vortex, which is closely related to the performance characteristic of the rotor. It is found that the behavior of the tip leakage vortex is considerably influenced by the tip clearance size. Under the same downstream condition, the low energy fluid accumulating around the leakage vortex expands, and the loss level in the vortex core decreases with the tip clearance increased. There is no abrupt change in the nature of leakage vortex in the cases of τ/c=1.0% and 1.7%, but the "breakdown" of leakage vortex occurs in the case of τ/c=2.7%. The vortex "breakdown" causes a sudden growth of the casing wall boundary layer, which has a large blockage effects. Therefore, a sudden drop in total pressure ratio occurs as the tip clearance size increases from 1.7%c to 2.7%c, and the rotor operate at near stall condition in the case of τ/c=2.7%.

The experimental and numerical results showed that the steady operating range of compressor rotor was extended and the compressor efficiency was reduced with casing treatment. The flow mechanisms of affecting compressor performance of the numerical simulation obtained by analyzing the flow-field in compressor with casing treatment, indicating that back flow formed in the slots has the ability to pump and blow the low energy liquids near end wall. Ejected flow formed in the slots inspirited the low velocity air mass of blade tip passage, which can suspend the rotor stall. The work of blade forcing on air in the blade tip was reduced with casing treatment. Back flow and the interaction between back flow and tip mainstream made serious flow loss. Thus, compressor rotor isentropic efficiency was reduced.

To validate the numerical results, the predicted total and elemental performance was compared with the available experimental data, and good agreement was achieved. The convergence history of the unsteady simulations at near stall condition showed that parameters, especially rotor efficiency and torque acting on blade, got nearly periodic fluctuation, and the period was about 2.5 blade passing time. By further analyzing the instantaneous flow structure near rotor tip, it was found that tip leakage vortex broken down at near stall condition. The interaction of the breakdown of tip leakage vortex, main flow and the tip leakage flow from the adjacent blade formed another distinct vortex, which was named as tip secondary vortex. The cyclical motion of this vortex was the main source of the periodic variation of the flow total parameters.

78650314318	Parametric investigation of circumferential grooves on compressor rotor performance	This paper presents numerical and experimental investigations about grooved casing treatment with the help of a high-speed small-scale compressor rotor. First, the numerical investigation seeks to offer a contribution of understanding the working mechanism by which circumferential grooves improve stall margin. It is found that stall margin gain due to the presence of circumferential grooves arises from the suction-injection effect and the near-tip unloading effect. Based on that, the philosophy of design of experiment is then set up. Finally, parametric studies are carried out through systematical experiments. It is found that the orthogonal experiment and the factorial analyses are successful in identifying the "best casing configuration" in terms of stall margin improvement. However, the ineffectiveness of the deduction from simulations suggests that the secondary flow circulations on stall margin gain should not be neglected, and the overall contribution of each groove to stall margin gain depends on its unloading effect and the compound effect of suction-injection. Further numerical investigation will focus on how to set up quantitative criteria to evaluate the compound effect of suction-injection and the unloading effect on stall margin gain respectively in each groove. © 2010 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

79952467027	Mechanism of influences of axial positions of axial skewed slot casing treatment on a compressor performance	Two investigations were performed for an axial-flow compressor rotor to explore the effects of axial positions of axial skewed slot casing treatment on the rotor performance. The steady operating range of compressor rotor was extended and the compressor efficiency was reduced with all casing treatments in the experimental and numerical investigations. The ability to improve the rotor steady operating range was the best when the axial position of casing treatment was unchanged. The ability was depressed obviously by moving the axial position of casing treatment backwards. The degree of damage on compressor isentropic efficiency was decreased when the axial position of casing treatment was moved forwards or backwards. The detailed analyses of the flow-filed in compressor with casing treatment indicate that, the development of tip leakage vortex could not been restrained by moving the axial position of casing treatment backwards, and the pumping ability of slot was reduced likewise, thus weakening the effect of extending the steady operating range of compressor; the work of blade forcing on air in the blade tip was not only increased, but also the flow loss caused by tip leakage flow and secondary flow were reduced when the axial position of casing treatment was moved forwards or backwards, making the rotor isentropic efficiency increase if compared the slot with axial position unchanged.

79960997288	Unsteady flow mechanism of spike emergence in a subsonic axial flow compressor rotor	Pre-stall behavior in a subsonic axial compressor rotor has been investigated by multi-passage three-dimensional time-accurate numerical simulations. The propagation speed of high pressure spot on flow annulus ahead of the rotor and its associated circumferential and radial influencing area agree well with the available experimental observations. This demonstrates that the current method captured the flow mechanism of spike emergence reasonably. The dominant feature of tip flow fields during the transition process is the formation of tip separation vortex and its propagation at different tip-passages. Should the strength of tip separation vortex in some passage exceed some critical value, its rear end will stand on the suction side of the blade. The tip clearance backflow from the adjacent passage spilled into the next passage as the rear end of tip separation vortex approached the trailing edge. This phenomenon can be considered as the threshold event of spike emergence for the test rotor.

79960329120	Mechanism analysis of stability improvement with tip injection in a transonic axial-flow compressor rotor	Multichannel, full three-dimensional, steady/unsteady numerical simulation with tip injection was carried out for NASA Rotor 35. The predicted overall performance of solid casing agreed very well with the experimental data. Predicted result showed that the stall margin could be improved by 21.4% when the jet amount was equal to 3.6% of choke mass flow of the rotor. The steady calculations showed that nearly 10% outerspan of flow annulus was influenced by tip injection. The high axial momentum introduced by injection decreased the flow incidence angle and diffusion factor, thus reducing near-tip blade loading, and accordingly the blockage region arising from the interaction between passage shock and tip leakage vortex. Unsteady simulation showed that stall margin improvement attribute to two aspects: one is reducing the loading on a certain blade, and the other is reinjection axial momentum into the low energy region formed by the interaction between shock/leakage vortex. The latter improved the passage flow to larger extent than that of the former. The higher jet frequency can make the tip injection restrain further development of low-speed area in each passage so as to achieve the stability improvement of compressor.

82055193737	Full-annulus simulations on axial compressor rotor at near stall condition	Full-annulus unsteady simulations were performed on a subsonic axial compressor rotor, and the detailed flow parameters at near stall condition were achieved. Ten numerical static pressure probes arranged in front of the leading edge could detect two pressure disturbances, one of which was developed into a spike wave. According to analysis of the flow field, tip secondary vortexes exist in almost all passages near the blade tip and the most violent one appears in the disturbing areas. Tip secondary vortex could force tip clearance flow to form "leading edge spilling flow" and "trailing edge back flow". The movement of the pressure disturbance along circumference was caused by the spreading of tip secondary vortex from one passage to the next. Continuous growth of tip secondary vortex in its spreading finally led to formation of spike wave. The phenomenon that the "trailing edge back flow" goes through the inlet and spills into the adjacent passage under the blade tip can be regard as the symbol of spike emergence.

84155182060	The analysis of interactional mechanism between hub corner stall and tip leakage flow in an axial-flow compressor stator	Taking a certain single-stage axial-flow compressor as the subject investigated, the interstage and outlet aerodynamic parameters were measured with pneumatic probes. Moreover, full three-dimensional numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the internal flow field of the stator with and without tip clearance. The overall performance and the spanwise distribution of the interstage and outlet parameters with tip clearance were predicted, and the results agreed well with the experimental data. The flow field near the endwall with tip clearance was compared with that without tip clearance, and it was found that the hub-suction surface corner stall was the main flow characteristic near the endwall. In the case without tip clearance, there existed a ring-like vortex structure near the hub-suction surface corner region, which consisted of multi-vortex system, and the vortex could induce a large amount of overturning flow on the suction surface. The introduction of tip clearance destroyed the formation of ring-like vortex structure, however a streamwise leakage vortex were formed at the hub-suction surface corner region. Meanwhile, the intensity of the spanwise separation vortex at the outlet of the passage was greatly increased. Both the leakage vortex and the increased separation vortex at the outlet edge enlarged the range of high total pressure loss under the 30% span at near stall condition.

84859751120	Numerical investigation into the mechanism of spike-type stall inception in an axial compressor rotor	Whole-passage simulations were conducted to simulate the stall inception process in a subsonic compressor rotor. The predicted results agreed well with available steady-state and time-resolving experimental data. The detailed flowfield analyses further demonstrated that the test rotor was of spike-type stall inception. The self-sustained unsteady cycle of tip separation vortex (TSV) was the underlying flow mechanism for the occurrence of the so-called 'tip clearance spillage flow' and 'tip clearance backflow'. Furthermore, the correlation between the selfsustained cycles of TSV in the preceding and native passages was the flow mechanism for emergence of spike. For the test rotor, the distinctive flowfield feature during the development of spike was the involvement of 'tip clearance back-spillage flow'. © IMechE 2011.

84859416868	Analysis of near-tip unsteady flowfield in a transonic compressor rotor at near stall condition	Three-dimensional single-passage steady and unsteady simulations were carried out to investigate the flowfield in a transonic compressor rotor (Rotor 35). Via comparing the steady predicted results with the available experimental data, it turned out that, in addition to matching the total performance map well, the predicted results also captured the trend of development of tip leakage vortex (TLV) reasonably well. The further unsteady calculation at near stall condition showed that the tip leakage flow without rolling up into TLV, encountered the incoming flow and then interacted with the low-energy area due to the breakdown of TLV, thus leading to the formation of tip secondary vortex (TSV). With the rearward movement of TSV, its location and associated blockage resulted in cyclic variation in near-tip blade loading, which in turn lead to the occurrence of a periodic self-sustained unsteady flow phenomenon in near-tip passage.

84864381469	Study of the control over the clearance leakage flow by modeling a non-axisymmetrical wheel hub of an axial flow compressor	A full three-dimensional numerical simulation was performed of a single-stage axial flow compressor with a clearance between the stator and rotor. An analysis of the flow field indicates that the leakage flow from the clearance between the stator and rotor can result in a relatively large flow separation in the end wall zone of the passage. To control the flow loss, a non-axisymmetrical modeling was performed of the wheel hub of the stator and the overall performance of the compressor was improved after the said modeling. The flow field analytic results show that the non-axisymmetrical end wall modeling can change the distribution of the static pressure on the end wall, thus improving the flow pattern of the clearance leakage flow in the passage and eliminating the return flow loss zone at the outlet of the passage. As a result, the total pressure ratio of the compressor increases and the isentropic efficiency goes up by 0.9%.

Then the test data with the autocorrelation analysis and the variance analysis was studied. Test data presented show that the compressor stall is caused by the spike and the stall inception signal can be detected obviously near the rotor leading edge. Finally, the reaction time of autocorrelation analysis is longer than that of the variance analysis for the compressor. Thus, autocorrelation analysis is more effective to detect the stall inception.

84865293607	Experimental validation and formation mechanism analysis of tip secondary vortex in a compressor rotor	Pressure variation on a compressor rotor casing wall was detected dynamically and wavelet method was used to analysis the dynamic static pressure signals detected on the rotor casing wall. The results show that there is a high-energy band near the tip secondary vortex frequency on the power spectrum map and the attenuation of the peak value along axial direction is consistent with the motion of tip secondary vortex. It indicates that the tip secondary vortex may exist in real flow field. Full-annulus unsteady simulation was conducted on the same rotor. According to the analysis of the full-annulus computation results, at near stall condition, there are accordant secondary vortexes in all the passages near the blade tip. Tip leakage flow from aft part of the tip gap interacts with the low-energy fluid caused by the breakdown of leakage vortex, which forms a tip secondary vortex in the blocking area. The tip secondary vortex affects the distribution of blade-loading near the blade tip which induces a cyclically self-excited flow phenomenon in the tip flow field.

84870363786	Leakage flow control-based leading edge blade tip machined design of an axial flow compressor	To control the blade tip leakage flow and enlarge the stability margin of a compressor, presented was a method for machining the blade tip at the leading edge. A high-energy fluid was introduced from the blade tip clearance at the leading edge and the turning direction of the leakage flow was controlled by the inertia of the incoming flow. A numerical method was adopted to study the influence of nine leading edge blade tip machined structures on the performance of the rotor at various rotating speeds. With an aim to increase the stability margin, an optimized design was performed of the blade tip machined structure. It has been found that with an incoming flow introduced from the leading edge blade tip clearance, the leading edge blade tip machining can lower the return flow extent of the leakage flow, thus decreasing the blocking extent of the passage. Under the premises of the total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency keeping constant, the stability margin of the rotor was increased by 2% and 3% at the high and low rotating speed respectively. There exists an optimum blade tip machining extent at which a relatively big increment of the stability margin can be obtained by the rotor at various rotating speeds.

84875081588	Stability improvement in high pressure-ratio centrifugal impeller with self recirculation casing treatment	In order to explore the mechanism of stability improvement, numerical investigations are performed to examine the role of the self recirculation casing treatment and a recirculation device in which upstream slot is sealed in the enhancement of operational range of a centrifugal impeller with high pressure-ratio. The numerical results approve that self recirculation casing treatment not only can suspend the stall effectively but also can improve the impeller efficiency and total pressure ratio appreciably in the near of stall region. The detailed analysis of the flow field at the blade tip shows that it reduces the blade loading in the impeller tip region. And hence the velocity of tip leakage flow exiting the bleed slot becomes lower compared with that without the self recirculation device. All these effects induced by the recirculation device are considered to lead to the suppression of the extension of blockage and to contribute to the enhancement of the impeller operating range.

Grooves at different axial positions were combined and studied to find out the stabilizing effect and their corresponding mechanism. The results confirm the effectiveness of shallow grooves that successfully enlarge the operating range of compressor with drop in efficiency less than 1%. The downstream grooves combine their influence on tip-clearance flow and stabilization in a linear manner, and finally change the stall type of the axial compressor.

84882797481	Full-annulus numerical investigation of axial flow compressor with self recirculation casing treatment	Effects on the performance and flow-field of subsonic axial-flow compressor are investigated with full-annulus numerical method with two kinds of self recirculation casing treatment, which are different in the number of self recirculation setting. The unsteady numerical calculative results show that stall margin improvement from 6.3% to 9% is achieved with two kinds of self recirculation casing treatment. The fundamental flow mechanism is obtained by detailed analyzing the flow-filed at the blade tip and the underlying mechanism consists of: (1) Leading edge spilling flow can be restrained by the high speed injecting flow coming from self recirculation casing treatment and consequently the flow-filed of blade tip passage is improved effectively. (2) When increasing the number of self recirculation setting from 10 to 15, the frequency of injecting flow affecting tip leakage flow is improved. As the result, the ability of casing treatment to restrain the negative effects of tip leakage flow is enhanced.

84883747889	Full-annulus numerical investigation of influence on flow-field in an axial flow compressor with inlet distortion	Effects of inlet distortion on the performance and flow-field of subsonic axial-flow compressor were investigated with full-annulus numerical method. The inlet distortion was made by setting some barriers in the inlet radial passage. The unsteady numerical calculative results show that inlet distortion decreases the performance of the compression rotor and reduces stall margin by 3.1%. The fundamental flow mechanism was obtained by detailed analyzing the flow-filed in inlet extended passage and in rotor passage. The underlying mechanism is that there are some regions of low value of inlet flow angle on the ring surface of rotor inlet upstream and those make the separated location of boundary in some tip blade suction move toward blade leading, which leads to serious blockage in tip blade passage. The blockage makes the tip clearance leakage flow spill to adjacent tip passage at leading edge on higher blade span, inducing rotor stall consequently. When the inlet flow-field of rotor is uniform, the blockage caused by tip clearance leakage flow is the primary cause resulting in rotor stall.

84888226829	Numerical investigation of the unsteady fluctuate performance for the internal flow-field within a centrifugal pump	In order to study the unsteady phenomena and to uncover the rules on how pumps' performance are effected by relative positions of their volutes and impellers, the internal flow-field of a low specific speed centrifugal pump was simulated by numerical method on a parallel distributed computer cluster. Simulation results show that the unsteady fluctuations of the internal flow-field is very strongly; the unsteady fluctuation frequency is determined by the number of blades and the rotational speed of its impeller; all parameters' instantaneous result are determined by relative positions of its volute and impeller. Results also show that rotor-stator interaction between volute inlet and impeller exit is the fundamental cause of the unsteady phenomena. For the purpose of improving the performances and fatigue capabilities of pump, the running noise and vibration must be controlled under special level, optimizing the matching of impeller and volute must be an effective method. So, the study on the unsteady fluctuation of the pump is very important and useful. Copyright © (2008) by Computers & Industrial Engineering.

84890222246	Experimental and numerical investigation of near-tip flow field in an axial flow compressor rotor-part i: Flow characteristics at stable operating conditions	Systematical casing pressure measurements were undertaken to supplement instantaneous experiment data to available database of a high-speed small-scale compressor rotor, which was crucial for understanding the flow mechanism of short-length scale stall inception. At the same time, improved full-annulus simulations were conducted to assist in interpretation of experimental observations. In Part I of current investigation, FFT (fast Fourier transformation) and STFT (short time Fourier transformation) analyses of instantaneous casing pressure signals were conducted to conclude flow characteristics near casing at stable operating conditions, and reasonable explanation of experimental observations was given in combination with the current and previous numerical results. FFT analyses of casing pressure signals showed a characteristic hump with varying band lower than blade passing frequency (BPF) appeared at near-stall stable conditions. This indicated that an unsteady phenomenon emerged from the neartip flow field for the test rotor. The variation in the amplitude of characteristic hump implied that underlying flow mechanism leading to the emergence of unsteady phenomenon originated from a location near leading edge and within passage. Further STFT analyses showed that the active frequency of this unsteady phenomenon varied with time, thus leading to the appearance of excitation band in FFT analysis results. FFT and STFT analyses of monitoring results of numerical probes arranged in absolute frame showed a similar unsteady phenomenon appeared in the simulated near-tip flow field. Detailed analyses of simulated instantaneous flow fields and comparison with measured flow characteristics indicated that the unsteady flow phenomenon observed in experiments was equivalent to rotating instability (RI) as far as non-uniform tip loading distribution was concerned, and the formation and activity of tip secondary vortex (TSV) was the flow mechanism of emergence of RI.

At the same time, improved full-annulus simulations were conducted to assist in interpretation of experimental observations. In Part II of current investigation, original instantaneous casing pressure signals and STFT (short time Fourier transformation) analyses were conducted to conclude flow characteristics near casing at stall inception operating condition, and reasonable explanation of experimental observations was given in combination with numerical results. The current experimental investigation showed the stall inception of the test rotor was triggered by a spike, propagating at about 66.7%, which evolved into a single fully-developed stall cell. STFF analysis of pressure signal detected by probe located at tip leading edge showed that frequency peaks with varied band, which already observed in near-stall stable flow condition in Part I, was still a dominant flow feature before spike emergence, though it was hardly perceived after spike emergence due to a sudden increase in the overall energy of pressure signal, which attributed to the interface of incoming and tip clearance flow beyond leading edge plane according to STFT results. Monitoring results of static pressures in the absolute frame from current simulation and the corresponding FFT and STFT analyses showed a similar flow field evolution process as those observed in experiment. The current investigation provided adequate experimental evidence to support the previous simulation results in which a viewpoint of formation and activity of tip secondary vortex (TSV) was proposed as the underlying flow mechanism of the origin of unsteadiness near casing at near-stall stable operating conditions, and emergence of spike during the transition of flow field into unstable state, and further verified that the unsteady flow phenomenon observed in near-stall stable flow condition was equivalent to rotating instability (RI), thus establishing the causal linkage between RI and stall inception for the test rotor.

84896039519	Parametric study of tip injection in a high-loaded axial compressor based on design of experiment	Parametric study of discrete tip injection on stall margin in a transonic compressor was presented with the method of three-dimensional unsteady numerical simulation. Combined with design of experiment and statistic analysis, the law of tip injection on stall margin was achieved and the mechanism of tip injection on enlargement of stall margin was also analyzed. The results show that tip injection is able to improve compressor performance and stability. Tip annulus wall boundary layer is encouraged by tip injection and tip leakage vortex blockage is depressed, which is the main reason of stability improvement. At the same time, tip injection can change the class of tip stall mechanisms in transonic compressor. The law of tip injection on stall margin varies with injection mass flow and there exists interaction between injection mass flow and throat height and between injection mass flow and injection angle. When injection mass flow is relatively less, throat height should be reduced and streamline is supposed to be aligned with rotor blade camber line at the leading edge in the rotating frame of reference. However, throat height should be increased to avoid blade tip stall and positive pre-whirl is suggested to reduce attack angle when injection mass flow is more. A certain distance between nozzle and blade tip leading edge should be kept.

84900497683	Numerical investigation on subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor with implementation of axisymmetric casing contouring optimization	For the study object of a subsonic axial-flow compressor rotor of Northwestern Polytechnical University, a reliable numerical simulation method was presented, and then axisymmetric contouring optimization for the casing under the condition of peak efficiency was conducted with the module DESIGN/3D in software package NUMECA, and the optimal rotor was obtained finally. The optimal rotor pushed the tip clearance leakage vortex away from the suction side at the leading edge of the blade. Although this led to an increase of the magnitude of leakage vortex and flow loss at the first 30% axial chord, the magnitude of leakage vortex and flow loss were greatly reduced at the last 70% axial chord of the blade, thus reducing the total loss, and increasing the peak efficiency and absolute total pressure at the outlet. The efficiency of the optimal rotor increases about 0.36% under the peak efficiency condition, which increases more under large mass flow rate condition, but under the near stall condition, the optimal rotor forms low velocity zone earlier at the blade tip area, leading to an earlier stall and making the stability margin of the optimal rotor smaller.

84904795226	Numerical investigation of inlet boundary layer skew in axial-flow compressor cascade and the corresponding non-axisymmetric end wall profiling	This paper investigates the influence of boundary layer skew on flow structure, total pressure loss, and flow control technique numerically on a high-loaded axial-flow compressor cascade. We have developed two new models respectively about loss evaluation and end wall flow control mechanism for more specific analysis. The result shows that boundary layer skew weakens the secondary flow and delays the generation of passage vortex when incidence approaches 0°. This results in a reduction of total pressure loss mainly (89.4%) due to relieved corner separation. However, as incidence exceeds a certain value (+7°), severe corner separation or even earlier corner stall can be induced by inlet boundary layer skew. Optimization procedure for profiled end wall at inflow condition of +7° incidence is further carried out to investigate the impact of boundary layer skew on flow control technique. The result shows that boundary layer skew should be counted in the optimization design of profiled end wall because of its significant influence on the development of end wall flow. The optimum profiled end walls for cases with and without boundary layer skew show great difference in the manner of end wall flow control. According to the improvement of cascades' performance, end wall profiling seems more efficient in reducing loss when influenced by the boundary layer skew. © IMechE 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/ journalsPermissions.nav.

84904883938	Design and analysis of 2D blade profile on a centrifuge impeller	A new method of 2D blade profile design on a centrifugal impeller was proposed to improve the aerodynamic performance of the impeller. The blade profile was designed through full three-dimensional numerical simulation by giving channel average relative velocity distribution along the radius, without changing the profiles of its hub and shroud. The computational results of isolated impeller show that the performance of the new impeller obviously increases in most conditions. Efficiency and pressure rise increase by 12% and 8.9%, respectively, at design point. At the same time, the low-velocity zones are both greatly reduced and the static pressure is uniformly distributed, too. The computational results for the whole fan with the original volute show that the efficiency increases by more than 10% at design point, and the backflow in the outlet section of the volute is eliminated. However, the pressure rise amount decreases in high flow conditions.

84904889589	Mechanism of unsteady influence of tip injection on a high-loaded axial compressor performance	Mechanism investigation on the unsteady influence of tip injection on a high-loaded compressor aerodynamic performance and stability margin was presented with the method of six-blade-passages three-dimensional unsteady numerical simulation in a transonic compressor. Quantitative analysis was made on the change of inner flow fields at different operating conditions with the application of two distinct injectors. The results show that tip injection is able to improve compressor total pressure ratio and stability, but it has little impact on compressor efficiency. The degree of the influence on compressor performance is determined by injected mass flow. Tip injection induces asynchronously periodic fluctuation of mass flow at compressor inlet and outlet of tip region. Blade tip loading will not be unloaded until the injected flow arrives at blade trailing edge, and blade tip loading varies periodically accordingly. The stability gain of 3.3% and 3.6%, respectively, is achieved by circumferential coverage percentage of 27.3% and 54.6%, respectively, with the identical injector throat height. It is proved that the effect on stability improvement of tip injection depends on the impact that tip injection makes at blade passage outlet by depressing tip blockage. The delay of injected flow in blade passage makes the blockage depression duration at passage outlet longer than that at passage inlet, so a small width injector is sufficient to depress tip blockage effectively and extending injector width contributes little to stability improvement.

84904913351	Investigation on relation between secondary flow and loss on a high loaded axial-flow compressor cascade	Numerical investigation was carried out to study the relation between secondary flow and loss generation in a high-loaded compressor cascade. Based on a series of qualitative analysis, a new quantitative analysis model has been derived further to attain the loss contribution of various sources, and the mechanism and effects of secondary flow on loss generation were finally conformed. The results show that loss due to secondary flow does not exceed 50% under a wide range of inlet attack angles. The indirect effect of secondary flow on low speed region is identified to dominate its contribution to loss with its direct dissipating remaining small magnitude order. A detailed research about the mechanism of the steep loss increase near corner stall also indicates that change in direction of cross flow, which is the change of indirect effect of secondary flow on low speed region, is mainly responsible as the incidence increases.

84907089131	Investigation on mechanism of perfomance improvement for compressor with new type of casing treatment with inlet distortion	Influences of the performance and flow-field of subsonic axial-flow compressor are investigated with full-annulus unsteady numerical method with self recirculation casing treatment under inlet distortion to uncover the flow mechanism. Inlet distortion is made by setting barriers in the inlet radial passage. The numerical calculative results show that besides gaining 6.8% stall margin improvements, the performance of compressor can be improved with self recirculation casing treatment under inlet distortion and the effect of increasing efficiency is better than the effect of increasing total ratio. The fundamental flow mechanism is obtained by analyzing the flow-filed in rotor passage in details. The detailed analysis of the flow-filed in compressor indicates that the separated locations of blades suction boundary in some tip passage move toward blade trailing with casing treatment and the highest value is about 11% the tip chord length, weakening the bad effect of flow separation and preventing leakage flow spill to adjacent tip passage. When injecting setups face the blade tip passage, the effect of restraining tip clearance leakage flow is the best.

84907522683	Experiment investigation and mechanism analysis of interaction of variable inlet guide vanes and axial skewed slots casing treatment	The variable inlet guide vanes and axial skewed slots casing treatment are effective measures that can extend the operating range of compressor. In order to analyze the mechanism of the interaction of these two measures, the different guide vanes angle with original smooth wall as well as slots configuration were tested on a single-rotor compressor. At the same time, the guide vane angle of 10° with each casing configuration and the guide vane angle of 0° with original smooth wall configuration are simulated. The results of experiment and calculation show that the introduction of these two kinds of measures can gain greater improvement of the stall margin. The difference of the flow fields of the rotor was analyzed. The positive angle of the inlet guide vane can weaken the separation of suction part flow, but it does not change the phenomenon of the stall induced at tip of the rotor blade. The axial skewed slots can weaken the structure of tip leakage vortex to get the improvement of the stall margin. The different mechanism of these two measures can make sure that using these two measures at the same time can gain greater improvement of the stall margin.

84907537266	The effect of injector size on compressor performance in a transonic axial compressor with discrete tip injection	The present study investigates the effects of injector size, which covers both circumferential extent and radial extent on compressor stability and radial work redistribution using time-accurate three-dimensional numerical simulations for multi-passages in a transonic compressor with discrete tip injection. Injector width ranges from 1% to 14.5% of casing perimeter and injector throat height varies from 2 to 6 times the height of rotor tip clearance. Six identical injectors are uniformly mounted around the annulus. Results indicate that, with sufficient covering of injection, tip injection can significantly improve compressor stability. Stability margin is improved by 3.5% employing 0.65% of the annulus mass flow. With injector width increased, stability improves sharply when the width is less than 4.5% of casing perimeter, but increases flatly for the rest coverage. Expanding injector throat height to an intermediate level can further enhance compressor stability, but excessive throat height is detrimental on account of the deterioration of the aerodynamic characteristic of Coanda injector. The average decrement of the blockage in injection region, which is defined as injection efficiency, is a key factor that takes primary responsibility for the capacity of tip injection in stability improvement. Injection efficiency derived from the same operating condition for all the configurations with tip injection is well-qualified to estimate the trend of stability improvement. The unsteady influence on radial work redistribution is much more significant than the time-averaged one.

The blade tip clearance included design clearance, half design clearance, quarter design clearance, 2 times design clearance and zero clearance. The results show that stall margin is improved 4%, and adiabatic efficiency and pressure ratio don't decline obviously, when the blade tip clearance reduced from design clearance to half design clearance. Details of the flow field were analyzed based on different stall forms and vortex dynamics. The change of clearance may improve stability margin greatly and clearance plays an important role in leakage vortex and separation of boundary layer, or even induces different stall forms. This has provided necessary basic research for design of the compressor are provided, and discussed the application condition of clearance control technology in aerodynamics.

0348202890	Digtial Simulation of An Active Control System of Compressor Stall Based on Injection	In this paper, a control system is constructed in theory to be used for active of rotating in an axial-flow compressor. The inlet injection is taken as the actuator of this control system. The control system is composed of five parts, such as the signals acquisition, harmonic analysis, the stall precursor pickup, the reconstruction of control signals and inlet injection actuator. The mathematic models of every parts of control system and compression system are derived. The model of compression system is the modified Moore-Greitzer model including inlet injections. Eight inlet flow coefficients are taken as the signals of rotating stall. The time lag of acquisition system is negligible. The harmonic analysis of stall signals and stall percursor pickup are based on SFC analysis method and the linearity examination of the phase of harmonics varying with time respectively. The reconstruction of control signals obeys the proportion feed law. The injection actuator is modeled as first-order lag. The digital methods, Mac Cormack's scheme and four-order Runge-Kutta method, are used to solve the equations of control system and compression system. Three simulation results, the development of rotating stall without any control and the responses of compression system with continuous control and discontinuous control respectively, are showed. The simulation results demonstrate that the rotating waves are able to be suppressed efficiently by means of the active control system proposed in this paper, and the compressor operation points are on the axial-symmetric characteristic curves.

84922321784	Numerical investigation on the effects of circumferential coverage of injection in a transonic compressor with discrete tip injection	Discrete tip injection upstream of the rotor tip is an effective technique to extend stability margin for a compressor system in an aeroengine. The current study investigates the effects of injectors' circumferential coverage on compressor performance and stability using time-accurate three-dimensional numerical simulations for multi passages in a transonic compressor. The percentage of circumferential coverage for all the six injectors ranges from 6% to 87% for the five investigated configurations. Results indicate that circumferential coverage of tip injection can greatly affect compressor stability and total pressure ratio, but has little influence on adiabatic efficiency. The improvement of compressor total pressure ratio is linearly related with the increasing circumferential coverage. The unsteady flow fields show that there exists a non-ignorable time lag of the injection effects between the passage inlet and outlet, and blade tip loading will not decline until the injected flow reaches the passage outlet. Stability improves sharply with the increasing circumferential coverage when the coverage is less than 27%, but increases flatly for the rest. It is proven that the injection efficiency which is a measurement of averaged blockage decrement in the injected region is an effective guideline to predict the stability improvement.

84924661832	Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Flow Characteristics Near Casing in an Axial Flow Compressor Rotor at Stable and Stall Inception Conditions	Casing instantaneous pressure measurements and full-annulus unsteady simulations were undertaken to analyze flow characteristics near casing at stable and stall inception conditions in an axial flow compressor rotor, and the objective was to establish its linkage with the stall inception process. The measured flow characteristic at near-stall stable operating conditions was the appearance of rotating instability (RI), which attributed to the activity of an unsteady flow with varying frequency. A similar flow characteristic was found in the simulated near-stall stable flow conditions, and detailed analyses of instantaneous flow field indicated the formation and activity of tip secondary vortex could be flow mechanism for the appearance of RI as far as nonuniform tip loading distribution in measurements was concerned. The measured flow characteristic before spike emergence was still the activity of RI. However, it was submerged into flow field accompany by the emergence of spike. The simulated stall inception process was similar to that from measurement, and further analyses of instantaneous flow field established the causal linkage between RI and stall inception process for the test rotor.
