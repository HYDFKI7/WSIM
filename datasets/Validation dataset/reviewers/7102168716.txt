33744905549	Content-based color image retrieval via lifting scheme	Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) aims at querying targets by using visual contents of image itself. Although classical wavelet transform is effective in representing image feature and thus is suitable in CBIR, it still encounters problems especially in implementation, e.g. floating-point operation and decomposition speed, which may nicely be solved by lifting scheme, a novel spatial approach for constructing biorthogonal wavelet filters. Lifting scheme has such intriguing properties as convenient construction, simple structure, integer-to-integer transform, low computational complexity as well as flexible adaptivity, revealing its potentials in CBIR. In this paper, by using general lifting and its adaptive version, we decompose HSI color images into multi-level scale and wavelet coefficients, with which, we can perform image feature extraction and similarity match by means of F-norm theory. Meanwhile, we provide a progressive image filtering strategy to achieve flexible CBIR. Eventually, the retrieval performances of lifting scheme are compared with those of its classical counterpart in retrieval accuracy and speed. © 2005 IEEE.

33744930846	High-level representations of temporary traffic states using Hasse graph and temporal change map under a grid-based site model	High-level representation of temporary traffic states is very crucial for intelligent traffic management applications, but a challenging task due to the complexity of the traffic states. In this paper, we present theoretically a high-level representation of temporary regional traffic states using Hasse graph and temporal change map under a grid-based site model. We first model the region within the monitoring range of the camera as an uncovered house and express it with a set of 4-tuples. Then we formulate a partial ordered relation with grid coordinates of the extracted objects in a specific site from which a Hasse graph is yielded. On the timeline, difference between two consecutive Hasse graphs makes a variable temporal change map. All temporary traffic states can be categorized into two types: one is the motion of a single object, represented simply with the Hasse graph of its location and the temporal change map; the other is the set of grouped patterns of all the extracted object, or the Hasse graph of the neighboring objects. With this representation and the fuzzy concept of neighborhood, key traffic states like collision and secure distance can be distinguished and determined using appropriate motion prediction based on the previous measurement to manipulate the undesirable cases on time. © 2005 IEEE.

33748694931	Video compression for multi-section scenes: A novel object-based approach	The current existing processing techniques in traffic surveillance applications for multi-sectional scenes are neither able to generate the video of the intersectional region, nor to derive directly the video for an arbitrarily specified section within these regions. A novel object-based approach is proposed, which is able to reconstruct the video of arbitrary section from the captured video clips for each fixed section. The background Sprite is generated from the captured video, compressed and stored in advance. Then the vehicular objects and the localized points of their minimum rectangular coverage are extracted using the background subtraction, and their equivalent reuse links are derived based on the motion analysis. Under a unified frame system, the video of arbitrary section can be robustly reconstructed by sliding a window to choose the related region Sprite and evaluate the position of the objects. With this approach, the compression ratio is higher and the reconstructed video is photo-realistic. Experimental results show that the PSNR difference of the reused objects is only about 3.83 dB and the textural MAD within the VOP with respect to its original frame is 30.37 dB or higher, having satisfactory visual quality with its subjective score 4 or above, thus substantiated the effectiveness of this approach.

Therefore, a new frequency tracking algorithm is proposed to improve the performance under variable conditions via adaptively changing its setting according to the estimations of noise density and dynamic characteristics. Three-phase voltage signals are transformed into a phasor by Clarke transformation and then a finite impulse response (FIR) filter is employed to suppress noise. Then, a phasor estimation of supplied signals is attained by applying a recursive least-square filter, which reduces the forgetting factor to get a fast tracking ability under dynamic conditions and increase it to have a good noise rejection performance under severe noise condition. Finally, the sample time interval is calculated via the angle difference between the last two estimations.

For guaranteeing system reliability, two different clock threads are designed, one is used to monitor middleware processes and another is used to monitor simulation platform process. Remoter stations have two operation modes as local and remote one. The principle of substation remote switch is that both exchange control authority of signal output after substation informs control center.

44449177147	Information fusion method of entropy evidences and its application to fault diagnosis in power system	Fast and exact fault diagnosis is principal precondition of isolating faulty components and restoring power system, so it is of great importance. Starting from theory of information fusion, this paper put forwards the fusion of several different wavelet entropies and put it into application to fault diagnosis in power system. Wavelet entropy can pick up the fault characteristic quickly and exactly because it combines together the advantages of Wavelet Transform and Shannon Entropy; but fault diagnosis based only on single wavelet entropy may cause difficult or inaccurate results because of the uncertainty and diversity of faults. Therefore, several different wavelet entropies are fused by the D-S evidence theory and the basic probability assignment is set up by a weighted average method based on norm, then a decision-making method based on the basic probability number is used to diagnose the faults. Simulations with EMTDC and Matlab prove that this diagnosis method can increase support strength and can improve the accuracy and the real-time performance of fault diagnosis in power system, so it is a feasible method for fault diagnosis in quantification.

The results of study indicate that; pantograph and overhead contact line system have the characteristics of fixed, slide and separated electrical contact. The phenomena of electric sparks between pantograph slide plates and contact wire is closely related to the electrical conductivity of pantograph slide plates and contact wire materials. The material combinations of copper magnesium alloy contact wire and carbon contact strip with high resistivity decide that the contact resistance is biggish, and the phenomenon of electric sparks is common during slide contact process. At the stage of high current electric traction train start or between low speed sections, the thermal energy caused by contact resistance can make the temperature of contact wire and slide plate too high in some parts. Some measures should be taken whenever necessary to decrease the contact resistance.

Arc maintains durative current collection by the electric traction train, however, they erode the pantograph and catenary system and produce electromagnetic interference to the environment. The arc erosion model is established on the basis of the transient heat conduction theory. The relation between temperature and time and that between temperature and time is deduced by calculation of heat conduction. Programming is completed in the MATLAB environment. Thermal processes of contact wire are simulated and calculated under the respective conditions of heat flows of static arc and moving arc. The results indicate that electric erosion of contact wire by static arc and moving arc varies from one another. Static arc can make the copper contact wire surface melt in a very short time. Electric erosion by moving arc varies with arc speed. The higher the speed of the electric traction train, the slighter the electric erosion degree of the contact wire surface.

In this paper, a novel background subtraction approach using a simple iterative approximation process with a uniform operator is presented. The process, assuming that the region is uniformly illumination-distributed when illumination of the scene varies, will normally derive two categories of results, one uniform, and the other non-uniform. The foreground objects will be extracted from the non-uniform regions after 3-4 iterative steps. The detection rule is very simple and uses only one reference image. The list of the regions, following by sizes of these regions, is generated and updated by the iterative process itself. All sub-regions at the same iterative step can be processed in parallel. 5-6 background images under similar illumination conditions are helpful at the beginning to evaluate the basic parameters of the estimation. Experiments show that this approach is effective in detecting the foreground objects in illumination-variant scenes. © 2008 IEEE.

Considering characteristic of hardware, software and mutual function relations between them, this article proposes a reliability model of combined hardware/software system based on Markov process.

This approach not only can express the spatial characteristic of supplied signals but also considers them as time-variant signals whose magnitude and frequency are changing against time. Therefore it possesses the ability of describing spatial property and time property of signals, simultaneously. By using the adjoining phasor estimate from synchrophasor phasor measurement units (PMUs) to express the dynamic characteristics in terms of derivatives, an accurate estimate of fault location can be attained via Newton iteration method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by computer Power System Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transient including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC)-generated signals under various situations.

On the basis of considering the impact of frequency-varying feature of parameters of transmission line on propagation characteristic of traveling wave, a single-terminal fault location method based on the time-frequency characteristics of traveling wave is proposed: firstly, the time characteristic of traveling wave's wavefront is linked with its frequency characteristic by Lipschits exponent of traveling wave signal; then by use of least squares method the Lipschits exponent of the detected second wavefront of traveling wave is fitted; finally, according to fitting result, the frequency components of fault traveling wave and the time when it arrives are determined, thus the fault distance can be calculated. Simulation results of EMTDC show that using the proposed fault location method, the accuracy of fault location is evidently higher than that by traditional traveling wave fault location methods, and the location accuracy is not affected by fault distance, fault resistance, fault inception angle and fault type, besides, the proposed method can well adapt to both transposed and untransposed lines.

Transient travelling wave signals, which are caused by faults occurred in transmission lines, contain abundant fault information in both time- and frequency-domain. Firstly, utilizing the multi-resolution analysis of wavelet the three-phase transient current travelling waves are decomposed and afterwards reconstructed to different frequency bands; than in a time-frequency window the time-frequency characteristic vectors are defined to fully reflect the time-frequency characteristics of the signal, and the time-frequency characteristics of the signal and their variation law are described by correlation coefficients, on this basis a method for fault detection and faulty phase determination of transmission lines based on time-frequency characteristics of transient travelling waves is proposed. Both reliability and adaptability of the proposed method are verified by the results of simulation experiments based on PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that the time-frequency characteristics based fault detection and faulty phase determination of transmission lines can provide accurate fault detection and faulty phase determination results which are not affected by fault distance, the moment when the fault occurred and transition resistance, besides the required data window is short.

84864764099	Travelling wave time-frequency characteristic-based fault location method for transmission lines	Single-ended travelling wave fault location methods have the advantages of avoiding the complexities and costs of the remote-end synchronisation. However, the determination of the arrival time of the travelling wave and its corresponding propagation velocity is a difficult problem which is apt to limit the algorithms' accuracy. A novel single-ended fault location method based on travelling wave time-frequency characteristics for transmission lines is proposed in this study. The time-frequency characteristics of the travelling wave signal are described by the Lipschitz exponent. The Lipschitz exponent of the second transient wave-front signal is estimated by using the wavelet transform and the least square method. Afterwards the frequency component of the travelling wave, which is best for fault location, and its corresponding arrival time and propagation velocity can be determined. Then the proposed method calculates the fault distance precisely based on the determined time and velocity. Extensive simulations have been carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the results demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed fault location method is significantly improved comparing with that of the traditional travelling wave fault location method. The proposed method is insensitive to different fault conditions, and it adapts to both transposed and untransposed lines well. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

84871098566	Study on power flow algorithm for metro traction supply system	Metro traction power supply systems adopt the bilateral power supply mode, which results in mutual influence between current converters at each two adjacent traction substations (TSS). This research took up track and down track as respective units to distribute DC power. Considering the relation among rectifiers and train regenerative braking, the active power outfeed of each TSS was figured out. Considering the characters of rectifiers, the TSS was regarded as a PQ node to calculate AC power flow. DC power flow was calculated until DC power distribution was convergence. Then the AC power flow was embeded into DC power flow and the results from AC/DC iteration were inserted to renew DC power flow until the value was convergence. The speed of the hybrid iteration algorithm is fast. And the analysis of the practical example verifies the accuracy and reliability of this algorithm.

84872502763	A power system fault location method based on natural frequencies of traveling waves	The fault location methods based on natural frequency of traveling wave for transmission line can accurately determine the fault position without identifying the wavefront of traveling wave and detecting the arrival time of traveling wave, so these methods possess a certain advantage. When fault occurs in power grid, fault traveling waves transmit along different paths and the natural frequency components reflecting different transmission paths are included in the frequency spectrums. Moreover, there is a certain relationship between the value of natural frequency and the length of the transmission path. Upon this foundation, a single-terminal fault location method based on transmission path of traveling wave and its natural frequency is presented in this paper. Firstly, the faulty line is judged by identifying the value of natural frequencies of the fault-traveling wave. And then according to the value of the natural frequency component reflecting the certain transmission path of fault-traveling wave, in which the fault point is included, the fault distance can be calculated accurately. A lot of simulation results show that the faulty line can be judged precisely and the fault distance can be estimated accurately base on the presented method, and the result of the fault location is not affected by fault positions, fault types, fault resistances and inception angles. Thus the presented method possesses better adaptability.

84874693420	An ANFIS-based fault classification approach in power distribution system	Fault classification is very important for power system operation because it is the premise of fault analysis process. In this paper, an ANFIS (Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System) based fault classification scheme in neutral non-effectively grounded distribution system is proposed. The transient currents are obtained by wavelet transform after faults occur. According to the statistic characteristic of transient currents in different fault types, the fault identifiers are defined.

The modeling process of system reliability based on the Kronecker algebra and consideration of state dependency and function dependency of component parts and the method for computing reliability indices of repairable systems were put forward. Reliability of basic system structures was studied considering the influence of maintenance in state dependency and failure in function dependency. The reliability model of the Guangzhou Metro ISCS was established with the controlled objects of the Guangzhou Metro ISCS as the study objects. The numerical results show as follows: State dependency and failure dependency of components will not change the mean time between failures (MTBF) of controlled objects, however, the ISCS may shorten the mean time to repair (MTTR) of the system under certain conditions; the MTTR of the system considering failure dependency is certainly shorter than that without considering failure dependency.

84880660275	Dynamic fault locator for three-terminal transmission lines for phasor measurement units	The study presents a fault locator for three-terminal transmission lines under dynamic conditions such as power oscillation based on synchronised phasor measurement units. This approach based on conventional static fault locator can express the dynamic characteristics of supplied signals and consider them as time-variant signals whose magnitude and frequency are changing against time. Therefore the authors can apply its ability of describing dynamic characteristics to threeterminal transmission lines and get the dynamic parameters of transmission lines under the dynamic conditions. By using Newton iteration, the proposed dynamic fault locator can acquire the three-terminal fault-location indices to identify a fault section and estimate the distance to fault. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by Power Systems Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC)-generated signals under various situations. An extensive set of simulation results show that the distinctive features of this method are that it performs with better accuracy than the conventional method for all types of faults at different fault locations and is practically immune to fault resistance. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.

84899412097	A rough membership neural network approach for fault classification in transmission lines	Objective: This paper presents a new approach for fault classification in extra high voltage (EHV) transmission line using a rough membership neural network (RMNN) classifier. Methods: Wavelet transform is used for the decomposition of measured current signals and for extraction of ten significant time-frequency domain features (TFDF), as well as three distinctive time domain features (TDF) particularly in terms of getting better classification performance. After extracting useful features from the measured signals, a decision of fault type of a transmission line is carried out using ten RMNN classifiers. Furthermore, to reduce the training times of the neural network, the rough neurons are used as input layer neurons, and the fuzzy neurons are utilized in hidden and output layer in each RMNN. And the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm is employed for determining the optimal connection weights between neurons of the different layers in the RMNN. Results and Conclusions: To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, extensive simulations have been carried out under different fault conditions with wide variations in fault type, fault resistance, fault location and fault inception angle. Simulations results show that the proposed scheme is faster and more accurate than the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and it is proved to be a robust classifier for digital protection. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
