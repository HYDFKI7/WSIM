84936857603	Maximum residual energy routing in wastage-aware energy harvesting wireless sensor networks	Traditional battery-powered sensor networks suffer from the inevitable lifetime limit due to the finite capacity of batteries. Energy harvesting WSN systems can provide a sustainable solution, however, the energy harvest properties need to be incorporated into the network design. In this paper, we consider the incorporation of energy- harvesting hardware, such as Photovoltaic (PV) panels, into the sensor nodes to augment the initial energy supply and to prolong or potentially achieve unlimited lifetime. In addition to accounting for node residual battery levels and forecast energy harvest, we propose a route selection scheme that takes into account the predicted wastage due to overcharge of finite battery, which has not been previously considered. We show in the simulation results that higher total residual energy can be achieved by considering energy harvest wastage into the routing decisions.

To be aimed at this, a new model is presented in which the end zone and end packets of stator cores are all included together, and the anisotropism as well as nonlinearity of the stator core are considered. The boundary value problem and the equivalent variation problem corresponding to the new model are derived. The field in the end region of the TSS854/90-40 hydraulic generator is calculated by the finite element method (FEM). The calculated results are identical to the measured results. Some factors which affect the field are analyzed. This provides the basis to improve the end structure design of large hydraulic generators.

It is necessary to accurately calculate the electromagnetic field in end-windings. But because the shape of end-windings is complicated, so in the previous models, the distributed end-windings are always replaced by continuous equivalent sheet or line current concentrated on the center line of windings, it is unable to calculate the electromagnetic field in the strands of end-windings. In the paper, the end-windings are considered as many rectangular current clement rigid bodies, the position-posture matrix in robot mechanics is applied for the first time to describe the current body's position, 3-D distributed stator current in end-windings is considered exactly. The electromagnetic field in the end winding's strand of a large hydraulic-generator is calculated by integral method, and then the best transposition way is determined.

58049098566	Optimization for time consumption on channel searching in cognitive radio system with Markov decision processes	As the demand for spectrum resources becomes more and more strong, and some spectrum has been underutilized for years, the concept "Cognitive Radio" becomes popular and is widely applied in practice. In a cognitive radio system, one of the important capabilities of cognitive users is that, they should or we may say they "have to" be able to search for a better channel to keep the users' data on transfer with acceptable quality when the interference in the current channel exceeds the limit they can live with. But practically the procedure of channel searching takes time and too much time consumption on that will definitely delay users' data transfer so that the system performance will get degraded, this is what a cognitive user has to be confronted with inevitably. From this perspective, as far as a cognitive user is concerned, how to decrease time consumption for channel searching as possible as we can becomes a critical technical problem. In this paper, we propose that this problem be modeled as a Markov decision processes (which is also referred to as MDP throughout this paper) such that we can solve this problem by the existing algorithms derived from the previous research on Markov decision processes and the results show that by using the algorithm of policy improvement, the long-term average time consumption for channel searching can be effectively minimized. © 2008 IEEE.

58049101780	Strategy of dynamic spectrum access based-on spectrum pool	Under static frequency allotment scheme, each licensed operator is allocated a frequency band in which its user can transmit, but the spectrum may not be fully utilized either on geographical or at temporal level. On the other hand, on some hot spot business frequency bands, spectrum resources become in short supply. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technology based on cognitive radio is an effective measure to improve the spectrum utility efficiency. It can increase spectrum income for spectrum holder, and provide a variety of services to users. Many papers discussed the technology of dynamic spectrum access and sharing based on cognitive radio. However, few reaches to the field of system performances evaluation based on spectrum pool strategy. In this paper, we propose two DSA strategies: one based on instant access manner, and the other based on spectrum pool access manner. Both theoretical and simulation results indicate that the DSA strategy based on spectrum pool has obvious advantages. Optimal capacity and update time of spectrum pool are all studied. It is found that there is quantitative mathematical relationship between the optimal capacity of spectrum pool and system efficiency. Update time of spectrum pool varies according to spectrum characteristics and user's Quality of Service(QoS) demands. There are different update strategies in licensed and unlicensed frequency bands. Under the assumed conditions, the update interval varies within one hour in most cases. © 2008 IEEE.

We examine the first and second order statistics of the collected data, including channel occupancy/vacancy statistics, channel utilization within each individual wireless service, and the temporal, spectral, and spatial correlation of these measures. Main findings include that the channel vacancy durations follow an exponential-like distribution, but are not independently distributed over time, and that significant spectral and spatial correlations are found between channels of the same service. We then exploit such spectrum correlation to develop a 2-dimensional frequent pattern mining algorithm that can accurately predict channel availability based on past observations.

73149122754	Temporal-spectral data mining in anomaly detection for spectrum monitoring	As the wireless services developed rapidly in the recent years, a diversity of wireless services emerge such that radio environment becomes more and more complicated. Radio Spectrum security is now attached with great importance. Real time spectrum anomalies detection is vital for increasing demand on security to ensure that wireless services function on the rails. Malicious radio events, such as illegal channel occupation, happened frequently in the recent years, which result in severe interference to the normal radio spectrum usage. There were anomalies detection approaches in different areas proposed to conquer such malicious events. However, those malicious events usually happen in a short interval, this increases the demand on instantaneous responds for real-time events, and the complexity of previous approaches makes them insufficient to handle the real time task. In this paper, a new approach for anomalies detection in spectrum monitoring is proposed. Distinct from previous anomalies detection methods, both temporal and spectral information are taken into account and utilized to find out the potential anomalies. Meanwhile, an adaptive learning ability is proposed along to respond to the real-time change of radio environment. To analyze spectrum measurement data with high dimension, Mahalanobis distance is applied to disclose potential anomalies according to the historical pattern of radio spectrum. Methodology analysis and real case study have been performed to validate the detection effectiveness in practice. ©2009 IEEE.

Therefore, the prerequisite for being "cognitive" lies in a deeper understanding of the characteristics of current spectrum behavior, such as a better model for spectrum behavior prediction, so as to design better and more efficient spectrum sensing and access schemes for secondary users in CR. A practical spectrum behavior learning method based on Multilayer Perception (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) is introduced in this paper, by which, state of different channels in future timeslots (either idle or busy) can be forecasted through supervised learning such that CR nodes can create a handover channel list in advance without interruption to its ongoing transmission. Performances are evaluated with an existing 7-days spectrum data set from a previous measurement, which was conducted in a metro city located in south China. The empirical results show that the method proposed in this paper can well fit the future spectrum behavior with the mean Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as low as 0.04. Besides, due to the generalization ability of ANN, the model generated from one radio service can be leveraged to predict spectrum behavior of another service with acceptable accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.

84866751169	Distributed opportunistic scheduling in power systems - An optimal stopping approach	Demand response plays a key role in saving energy expenditure for future smart grid systems. For a system with multiple users which have different energy consumption and real-time requirements, the scheduling problem is quite challenging. In this work, we propose a novel distributed opportunistic scheduling scheme based on the optimal stopping rule approach. Our objective is to minimize the total energy cost while satisfying the energy and timing requirements of each user. We show that the optimal scheduling scheme is a pure threshold policy, i.e., each user need to be turned on when the electricity price is lower than a certain value; otherwise, remains idle. Our simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity distributed scheduling scheme can dramatically reduce the cost. A heuristic peak avoid approach is also proposed to bypass the peak peak price, which is a often a priori. Our result can also be implemented to the problem of maximizing profit with a fixed amount of energy, which is, in fact, the dual of the energy minimization problem. © 2011 IFAC.

84874074388	Reuse of GSM white space spectrum for cognitive femtocells access	Nowadays, cyber-physical system (CPS) relies on wireless networks for devices control and information backhaul. But the mass deployment CPS devices make operators' spectrum scarce situations even more worse. Hence, cellular network operators anticipate the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technology to solve the spectrum shortage problem in the context of cognitive radio (CR). Femtocells, acting as gateways in CPS, integrate CPS devices into cellular networks in a seamless manner. The concept of cognitive femtocell can solve the spectrum congestion problem even within a massive network on the CPS scale. However, in practical systems, cellular white space spectrum should be quantitatively measured to guide cognitive femtocell access algorithms design. We are the first to conduct a comprehensive measurement study for the purpose of measurement, discovery and model features of GSM white space spectrum. We evaluate availabilities of extra 21.4 MHz capacity in GSM white space spectrum as a reason of artificial GSM network spectrum planning. In our study, we find out that perfect results can hardly be obtained because of inherent measurement trade-offs, even when extremely high sweep speed of 16 GHz/s is applied at the receiver. Based on statistical analysis of real-scene traces, we propose an Efficient Duty Cycle (EDC) model to accurately characterize the white space in GSM network by considering missdetection probabilities. Cross-validating evaluation results show that the EDC model can well decrease interference probabilities at high time-granularity measurement periodicity scenarios. Our results confirm the feasibility of cognitive femtocells access in an intra-operator scenario and can be applied to future wireless networks. © 2012 IEEE.

84875050889	Real-time opportunistic scheduling for residential demand response	Demand response is a key feature of the smart grid. The addition of bidirectional communication to today's power grid can provide real-time pricing (RTP) to customers via smart meters. A growing number of appliance companies have started to design and produce smart appliances which embed intelligent control modules to implement residential demand response based on RTP. However, most of the current residential load scheduling schemes are centralized and based on either day-ahead pricing (DAP) or predicted price, which can deviate significantly from the RTP. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme based on the optimal stopping rule as a real-time distributed scheduling algorithm for smart appliances' automation control. It determines the best time for appliances' operation to balance electricity bill reduction and inconvenience resulting from the operation delay. It is shown that our scheme is a distributed threshold policy when no constraint is considered. When a total power constraint exists, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be implemented in either a centralized or distributed fashion. Our scheme has low complexity and can be easily implemented. Simulation results validate proposed scheduling scheme shifts the operation to off-peak times and consequently leads to significant electricity bill saving with reasonable waiting time. © 2012 IEEE.

84876025578	Digital dividend capacity in China: A developing country's case study	In this paper, we present digital dividend (DD) spectrum capacity gain brought about by switching from analogue terrestrial television (ATT) to digital terrestrial television (DTT) which is now ongoing in China. DD spectrum represents total of TVWhite Space (TVWS) and the released spectrum in our paper. Since spectrum measurement is the most effective method to evaluate the capacity, we use measured TV UHF band data from 470 MHz to 798 MHz from diverse locations to acquire a quantitative DD capacity. Our results confirm the existence of at most 168 MHz DD capacity in urban areas which will provide good opportunities for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) applications. We observe that during the transition period introducing DTT to rural areas tends to provide less spectrum compared with purely ATT broadcasting. Hence, rural areas have less DD capacity compared with urban areas, which totally contradicts previous measurement findings. Our data validates the practicality of fixed power level threshold rules for idle TV channel detection. We find field strength is another threshold choice for determining TV channel states. Our spectrum measurement methodology and findings are applicable to spectrum planning and spectrum regulations, especially for developing countries that are in DTT transition periods. © 2012 IEEE.

84876039132	Optimal power allocation for OFDM-based cognitive radios with imperfect channel sensing	Opportunistic spectrum access in Cognitive Radio (CR) systems significantly improves spectrum efficiency by allowing secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically use licensed spectrum without causing harmful interference to primary users (PUs). However, as a prevailing transmission scheme, OFDM introduces unwanted interference to the primary user due to its side-lobe leakage. Meanwhile, miss detection and false alarm caused by imperfect sensing of SUs inevitably degrade PU's performance to a certain extent. In this paper, we propose an efficient power allocation algorithm for an OFDM-based CR system taking into account the interference resulted from both side-lobe leakage and imperfect channel sensing, simultaneously. The algorithm we propose maximizes the downlink transmission capacity of the CR users, while keep the Co-channel Interference (CCI) and the Side-lobe Interference (SLI) introduced by the CR users under a tolerable level. Based on the convex optimization theory, we leverage the dual decomposition method (DDM) to solve the problem of the optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in context of protecting PU's transmission. © 2012 IEEE.

At first, through our measured UHF TV data, we find TV channels exhibit constant patterns which mean channel availabilities in future can be predicted for cognitive access with the REM system. We design a detailed REM implementation framework in a multi-service (between UHF TV and cellular services) spectrum reuse scenario to solve cellular networks' spectrum scarce problem.

84881560204	Throughput optimization for self-powered wireless communications with variable energy harvesting rate	Energy harvesting is considered as a promising solution to efficiently prolong the lifetime of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, wireless energy harvesting, which scavenges energy from ambient radio signals, has recently received an increasing attention. In this paper, we consider a self-powered wireless system with one transmitter and one receiver, in which the transmitter has no fixed power supplies and extract energy only via wireless energy harvesting from ambient radio signals. It is assumed that the transmitter follows a save-then-transmit protocol, which specifies that a fraction (referred to as save-ratio) of time is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting while the remaining fraction is used for data transmission. We focus on the optimal save-ratio selection and achievable throughput maximization in two cases with regard to energy harvesting rate: the deterministic case, in which energy harvesting rate is known in advance, and the stochastic case, in which energy harvesting rate is unknown and only its statistical properties (e.g. probability distribution) are available. The optimal save-ratio for the two cases is theoretically derived as a function of energy harvesting rate (or its statistical properties). The experimental results characterize how the optimal save-ratio and the maximal achievable throughput vary with energy harvesting rate and validate the optimality of save-ratio selection. © 2013 IEEE.

84884634489	Novel error resilient tag estimation for RFID system in interference scenarios	In a radio frequency identification (RFID) system, the backscattered signal is small and prone to interference. The performance of RFID tag identi?cation in interference scenarios is degraded compared to that in error-free scenarios. In this paper, a novel Mahalanobis distance estimate (MDE) method is proposed to jointly estimate the number of tags and packet error rate (PER). The MDE method is error resilient owing to its ability to achieve a stable estimation when interference is impairing the observed information. The proposed method achieves significantly enhanced accuracy over existing methods by taking all the information and correlations among the observed results into account. The MDE method improves the estimate performance based on efficient decorrelation and classification of the observed information. Moreover, the performance of the PER estimate is analyzed both in theory and through simulations. It can be concluded from the analysis that the estimated PER is unbiased and variance-bounded. Simulations show that the proposed estimate outperforms the previous proposals in terms of accuracy and stability, which makes it suitable for application in interference scenarios. © 2013 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

84886711088	Statistical modeling for spectrum usage characterizing wireless fading channels and mobile service dynamics	Cognitive radio (CR) is considered a promising technology for addressing the issue of spectrum scarcity and has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One of its 'cognitive' capabilities is environment awareness, which gathers useful information from the radio environment, such that CR devices can accordingly change the operating (e.g., spectrum sensing) strategies. Spectrum measurement is an effective means for radio environment awareness since ground-truth observation of spectrum usage is more convincing than any theoretical assumption. In this paper, we perform in-depth statistical analysis on wireless signal strength in mobile service (MS) bands and propose a novel statistical model based on characteristic function (CF), which characterizes both wireless fading channels and MS dynamics. We validate the proposed model through empirical studies on the spectrum measurement data previously collected in Guangdong Province of China. We statistically fit the CF of the overall signal strength in MS (GSM uplink) band and estimate both Nakagami fading parameters of wireless channels and the arrival rate of MS. Then, we further utilize the estimated information to optimize the spectrum sensing strategy, which aims at maximizing the secondary user's (SU's) expected achievable throughput. The simulation results show that the optimal sensing strategy that we propose significantly improves the long-term average achievable throughput since it fully utilizes the estimated information on wireless fading channels and MS dynamics. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

84890812617	Energy-efficient link adaptation for cognitive radios with heterogeneous QoS requirements	Energy efficiency is crucial in wireless communication systems, especially in cognitive radio (CR) systems in which the exclusive functionality of spectrum sensing inevitably incurs additional energy consumption.

Two classes of SUs with different QoS are considered: delay-sensitive SUs (DS-SUs) and delay-tolerant SUs (DT-SUs). We focus on energy efficiency (EE) maximization taking into account the SUs' heterogeneous QoS and PU interference constraint. The problem of EE maximization is formulated as a nonlinear fractional programming problem, which is transformed into an equivalent parametric programming problem. Moreover, optimal solution to joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation is derived with the bisection method and dual decomposition method (DDM) in convex optimization theory.

Energy harvesting is considered as a promising solution to alleviate such issues and has received extensive attentions. In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio system with one primary user (PU) and one secondary user (SU) and both of their transmitters operate in time-slotted mode. The SU, which harvests energy exclusively from ambient radio signal, follows a save-then-transmit protocol. In such a scenario, we investigate the SU's optimal cooperation strategy, namely, the optimal decision (to cooperate with the PU or not) and the optimal action (to spend how much time on energy harvesting and to allocate how much power for cooperative relay). We separately investigate the optimal action in non-cooperation and cooperation modes to maximize the SU's achievable throughout and derive the optimal closed-form solutions. Based on the analytical results of the optimal solutions, we propose the optimal cooperation protocol (OCP) to make the optimal decision, which simply involves a two-level test. Simulation results show that the proposed OCP outperforms the other two protocols (non-cooperation protocol and stochastic cooperation protocol) and the optimal underlay (OU) transmission mode.

By translating the original optimization problem into a convex one, we show that the optimal solutions for sample number, mini-slot number as well as sensing threshold are non-unique and single-slot spectrum sensing is more practically preferable. We also investigate the impact of system parameters to the optimal sensing strategy.

84924412750	Multi-commodity online maximum lifetime utility routing for energy-harvesting wireless sensor networks	The energy limitation of wireless sensor networks can be solved by harvesting energy from environmental sources such as solar and wind to power the sensor nodes. We propose an energy-harvest-aware routing scheme that incorporates harvest availability properties and energy storage capacity limits into the routing decisions. In contrast to most existing energy-harvesting routing algorithms that route each traffic flow independently from each other, we consider multiple traffic flows, or commodities, and formulate the multi-commodity routing problem as linear optimization problem. The proposed scheme balances two routing objectives of maximum total and maximum minimum residual energy to prolong the network lifetime. The simulation results show that both higher total and higher minimum residual energies are achieved.
