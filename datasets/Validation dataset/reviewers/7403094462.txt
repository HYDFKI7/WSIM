84930916438	Clinicopathologic features of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma	Objective To study the clinicopathological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPRCC). Methods The histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features were studied in 11 cases and follow-up data were also analyzed. Results There were a total of 3 females and 8 males. The age of patients were ranged from 33 to 72 years (mean age 52. 5 years). The diameters of tumors varied from 1cm to 4 cm. Histologically, papillary and cystic architecture were present at least focally in all tumors. The papillae were covered by small to medium-sized cuboidal cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and often showed extensive secondary branching, which were often folded and densely packed, resulting in a solid appearance. The nuclei were round and uniform in shape; nucleoli were not prominent (Fuhrman grade 1 or 2). Neither mitotic figures nor necrosis was present. All 11 cases exhibited moderate to strong positivity for CK7, CA9, vimentin, and HIF-1α, coupled with negative reactions for CD10, P504S, and TFE3. Ksp-cadherin was positively expressed in 8 cases. VHL gene mutations were not found in all 11 cases. Losses of chromosomes 3 (monoploid chromosome 3) was detected in 3 cases. Conclusions CCPRCC is uncommon and seemed to be an indolent tumor. The differential diagnosis should be included tumors, which harbor clear cell and papillary structure including clear cell renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma, Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma, and CCPRCC. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis may be help for its diagnosis.

21744435591	CD10-positive stromal cells in gastric carcinoma: Correlation with invasion and metastasis	Background: CD10 is a cell surface metalloproteinase expressed by a variety of normal cell types, including lymphoid precursor cells, germinal center B lymphocytes and some epithelial cells. Although accumulating data indicate that CD10 expression by stromal cells is involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and it is a novel prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, CD10-positive stromal cells and their correlation with invasion and metastasis have not been studied in gastric carcinoma. The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically investigate the rate of CD10 production in the stromal cells in our gastric carcinoma collection and clarify its correlation with invasion and metastasis. Methods: One hundred and sixteen cases of gastric carcinoma were analyzed immunohistochemically using a monoclonal CD10 antibody (clone 56C6). Results: The expression of CD10 by stromal cells was significantly higher in the primary gastric carcinomas than in normal and dysplasia mucosas (P = 0.014). More frequent expression of CD10 by stromal cells was detected in differentiated carcinoma than in undifferentiated carcinoma (P < 0.001). CD10 expression by the stromal cells was associated with depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Stromal CD10 expression was lower in gastric carcinoma without vessel invasion than in those with vessel invasion (P = 0.001). However, no association was observed between stromal CD10 expression and TNM stage. In differentiated carcinoma, stromal CD10 expression was associated with the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, vessel invasion and TNM stage (P < 0.01). Conclusion: These results indicate that stromal cells expressing CD10 may play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. CD10 expression by stromal cells seems to promote invasion and metastasis of differentiated gastric carcinoma. © 2005 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.

33750080765	Clinicopathologic study of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma of brain	Objective: To study the clinicopathologic features, treatment response and prognosis of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA). Methods: Amongst a total of 6 287 patients with central nervous system tumors encountered in Nanjing General Hospital of PLA during the period from 1980 to 2004, 15 cases of PXA were found. Two additional cases of PXA were also retrieved from the authors' consultation files. The clinicopathologic features of the 17 cases were studied. Follow-up information was available in 10 patients. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 12 to 55 years (mean = 30.8 years). The male-to-female ratio was 6:11. Commonest clinical symptoms included seizures, headaches and dizziness. The tumors in 16 patients were located in the superficial cerebral cortex (94.1%). Seven cases (41.2%) involved the temporal lobe. The size of the tumors varied from 2 to 7 cm (mean = 4.3 cm). Cystic degeneration was noted in 9 cases. For those in-house cases, total tumor excision was performed in 12 patients and subtotal tumor excision was performed in 3 patients. Amongst the 10 patients with follow-up information available, 8 were alive. The post-operative survival ranged from 10 months to more than 13 years (mean survival = 6 years). Classic histopathologic features included an admixture of mononuclear cells, bizarre multinucleated giant cells, spindled cells and lipid-rich vacuolated cells. The tumor cells were associated with abundant lymphocytes and reticulin fibers. They showed little tumor necrosis or mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated diffuse positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin and S-100 protein. Seventy-seven percent of the cases also showed positive staining for CD34. One case had anaplastic transformation, with increased mitotic activity (mitotic count ≥ 5 per 10 high power fields). The tumor cells infiltrated the underlying cerebral cortex with extension into perivascular spaces in 2 cases. Radiologic examination revealed tumor recurrence with diffuse leptomeningeal spread in 1 case. Conclusions: PXA is low-grade glial tumor, corresponding to WHO grade II. Cases with typical pathologic features and total tumor excision carry favorable prognosis. Local recurrence or anaplastic transformation may occur in rare examples. Histologically, PXA can be mistaken as WHO grade IV giant cell glioblastoma, as both entities possess tumor giant cells. PXA however harbors lipidized astrocytes and lacks coagulative tumor necrosis and high mitotic activity. Frequent expression of CD34 in PXA is also helpful in differential diagnosis.

33847795467	Expression of Ksp-cadherin in renal epithelial neoplasm and its clinicopatholoeic significance	Objective: To study the expression of a novel marker, kidney-specific- protein (Ksp) - cadherin, in renal epithelial neoplasms and its clinicopathologic significance. Methods: Immunohistochemical study (using EnVision method) for Ksp-cadherin, CD10, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen and CK7 was carried out in normal human kidney samples, as well as in 166 cases of primary renal neoplasms (including 120 cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 20 cases of papillary RCC (type I papillary RCC 15 cases and type II papillary RCC 5 cases), 18 cases of chromophobe RCC and 8 cases of oncocytoma). Results: Ksp-cadherin was expressed in distal convoluted tubules of normal kidney in a membranous pattern. It was also detected in 23% (27/120) of clear cell RCC, 20% (4/20) of papillary RCC, 100% (18/18) of chromophobe RCC and 75% (6/8) of oncocytoma. High expression of CD10 and vimentin was noted in clear cell RCC and papillary RCC. CD10 was also expressed in chromophobe RCC in cytoplasmic pattern, compared with membranous staining in the other tumors. CK7 expression was mainly seen in chromophobe RCC and papillary RCC, while epithelial membrane antigen was expressed in all variants of RCC. On the other hand, the expression of Ksp-cadherin in clear cell RCC correlated with tumor stage and grade. Conclusions: Ksp-cadherin is expressed in normal distal convoluted tubules and the related neoplasms. It carries relatively high specificity and sensitivity in diagnosis of chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma. The expression of Ksp-cadherin also correlates with biologic behavior of clear cell RCC.

34047093823	Clinicopathologic features, prognosis and etiology of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone	Objective: To study the clinicopathologic features, prognostic indicators and possible etiology of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone (PNHLB). Methods: The clinicopathologic features of 17 cases of PNHLB were reviewed. In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus early RNA (EBER) and polymerase chain reaction for bcl-2/JH gene rearrangement were performed using paraffin-embedded materials. The correlation between serum lactic dehydrogenase level, treatment options, international prognostic indicator (IPI) and immunophenotype with clinical outcome were analyzed. Results: The majority of the 17 cases studied was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (94.1%). The 5-year survival rate was 68.8%. Unfavorable prognostic factors included high-risk IPI (P = 0.031) and bcl-2 overexpression (P = 0.028). Treatment options and expression of CD10, MUM-1 or bcl-6 did not correlate with clinical outcome (P > 0.05). Only 1 patient was positive for EBER, as demonstrated by in-situ hybridization. Conclusions: The clinical outcome of PNHLB is relatively favorable. IPI and bcl-2 expression may serve as useful prognostic indicators. EBV is likely not related to pathogenesis of this type of lymphoma.

34249720003	Renal cell carcinoma associated with Xp11.2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions: A study of 11 cases and review of literature	Objective: To study the clinicopathologic features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma associated with Xp11.2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions. Methods: The histopathologic findings and immunophenotype of 11 cases of renal cell carcinoma associated with Xp11. 2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions were studied. Follow-up data (ranged from 10 to 112 months) were also analyzed. Results: There were a total of 7 females and 4 males. The age of patients ranged from 8 to 26 years (mean = 16. 3 years). The diameter of the tumors varied from 2.5 to 6.0 cm. Histologically, two morphologic patterns were seen. The first pattern consisted of alveolar, papillary or nested architecture. The tumor cells contained voluminous, clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, distinct cell borders, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Psammoma bodies were frequently found and could be abundant. In contrast, the second pattern was composed of nested and compact architecture. The tumor cells possessed less abundant cytoplasm and inconspicuous nucleoli. Few psammoma bodies were detected. Immunohistochemical study showed that all cases strongly expressed TFE3, CD10 and P504s. Variable positivity for pan-cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin was also noted. None of them expressed CK7, Ksp-cadherin and CD117. Conclusions: Renal cell carcinoma associated with Xp11. 2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions is a newly described but rarely encountered subtype of renal cell carcinoma. Pathologic diagnosis can be established when taken age of the patients, histopathologic findings and immunoreactivity for TFE3 protein into consideration.

34848837664	Topical dorsal skin immersion in seawater induces apoptosis and proliferation in hairless mice	Recreational and occupational exposure to seawater (SW), have increased but the effect of SW on skin has not been elucidated. The purpose of present study was to assess the effects of SW immersion on the dorsal skin in hairless mice. Adult hairless mice were individually immersed in SW for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h; then, full-thickness dorsal skin of 2 cm diameter was excised for pathological examination (light microscope), apoptosis detection (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nick end labeling [TUNEL]) and proliferation index evaluation (immunohistochemistry). Normal and normal saline (NS)-immersed skin were used as controls. Histological examination revealed that there were randomly distributed cell deaths, presenting cell shrinkage, condensation of nuclear chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm in the epidermis, and neutrophil infiltration in the dermis, after SW immersion. Moreover, TUNEL showed low levels of apoptosis in normal (9.07 ± 0.70%) and NS-immersed skin (9.99 ± 1.22%). There was an apparent increase in the 6-h and 12-h SW immersed groups (29.90 ± 6.85%, P < 0.01; 45.46 ± 6.12%, P < 0.01, respectively). Ki-67 antigen was located in the basal layer of the epidermis and hair follicles, the rates of Ki-67-positive cells were 7.90 ± 1.45% and 7.76 ± 1.52% in normal and NS-immersed skin, respectively, and in the 12-h SW immersed group, the rate of Ki-67-positive cells reached 23.85 ± 4.21% (threefold, P < 0.01). In each group, the rate of apoptosis was higher than that of proliferation. We conclude that SW immersion can cause time-dependent apoptosis and proliferation in the epidermis, and the overall effect of SW immersion is injury to the epidermis. © 2007 Japanese Dermatological Association.

35348908291	Differential expression of EphA7 receptor tyrosine kinase in gastric carcinoma	Overexpression of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases in cancers is related to malignant transformation, metastasis, tumor differentiation, and prognosis. Down-regulation of EphA7 secondary to hypermethylation has been reported in colorectal cancer. In the present study, expression of EphA7 in gastric cancer cell lines and gastric carcinoma specimens was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The expression of EphA7 was reduced in all tested gastric cancer cell lines; however, there is marked variability in expression among gastric carcinoma specimens. Overexpression was observed more often in younger patients (aged ≤65 years) (P = .03) and in patients with advanced cancer (P = .031). Hypermethylation of the EphA7 promoter-associated CpG island was found using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Down-regulation of EphA7 was significantly related to hypermethylation (P = .001), and the level of hypermethylation was greater in moderately differentiated tumors than in poorly differentiated ones (P = .03). We also performed immunohistochemical staining for EphA7 in 52 gastric carcinoma specimens and found that expression of the protein was consistent with its transcript expression, with the protein being significantly overexpressed in younger patients (P = .016) and in patients with advanced tumors (P = .033). Our data indicate that EphA7 may have roles in the pathogenesis and development of gastric carcinomas. © 2007.

43049139925	Loss of expression of EphB1 protein in gastric carcinoma associated with invasion and metastasis	Objective: EphB1 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases that is involved in embryonic nervous and vascular system development. Over- or underexpression of certain Eph receptors has been found in some cancer samples compared to normal tissue. Expression of Eph receptors is related to malignant transformation, metastasis, differentiation, and prognosis of cancers. Recently, the EphB subfamily has been shown to be involved in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer. In the present study, expression of the EphB1 transcript and protein in gastric carcinoma samples was determined to investigate the roles of EphB1 in development, progress and prognosis of gastric carcinoma. Methods: Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining were used. Results: The EphB1 transcript was overexpressed in 68.9% (42/61) and underexpressed in 14.8% (9/61) of cases. However, the expression of protein was greatly different from the transcript expression, with overexpression and underexpression being 17.2% (10/58) and 44.8% (26/58), respectively. In addition, we showed that underexpression of EphB1 protein is significantly associated with invasion, stage and metastasis in gastric carcinomas. Conclusion: EphB1 may have a tumor-suppressive role in gastric cancer. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

4444241490	Significance of effector protease receptor-1 expression and its relationship with proliferation and apoptotic index in patients with primary advanced gastric adenocarcinoma	Aim: To investigate the expression of effector protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), proliferative index ki-67 and apoptosis index in patients with primary advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and to clarify the significance of EPR-1 expression and its correlationship with the proliferation and apoptosis indexes. Methods: Using immunohistochemical staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labelling (TUNEL) technique, we determined the expression of EPR-1, proliferative index (Ki-67) and apoptotic index (AI) in 120 paraffin-embedded specimens of primary advanced gastric adenocarcinoma as well as lymph node metastasis and adjacent normal tissues. Results: EPR-1 expression was distributed in the cytoplasm of normal gastric mycoderma, carcinoma cells and smooth muscle cells. The positive rate of EPR-1 expression in the primary gastric adenocarcinomas, invasion tumor node and lymph node metastasis was 65.83%, 55.29% and 68%, respectively. While the positive rate in normal gastric mycoderma and smooth muscle cells was 46.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The average positive rate of ki-67 in EPR-1-positive tumors was 7.00% which was significantly lower than that of 8.53% in EPR-1-negative tumors, but the average AI in EPR-1-positive tumors was 1.25%, which was significantly higher than that of 1.00% observed in EPR-1-negative tumors. On the other hand, the average positive labeling index for Ki-67 (ki-67) in EPR-1-positive lymph node metastasis was 7.65%, which was significantly lower than that of 9.44% observed in EPR-1-negative lymph node metastasis. However, the average AI in EPR-1-positive lymph node metastasis tumors was 0.99%, which was significantly higher than that of 0.67% observed in EPR-1-negative lymph node metastasis. Conclusion: The frequency of EPR-1 expression was significantly higher in primary gastric adenocarcinoma and in its lymph node metastasis than that in normal gastric mucosa. Expression of EPR-1 was significantly correlated with tumor histological subtypes and tumor differentiation. Weighted EPR-1 Score is positively correlated with apoptosis index, but is negatively related with proliferative index. Thus, Weighted EPR-1 Score and EPR-1 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cells maybe a potential marker in clinical setting. Copyright © 2004 by The WJG Press.

49149108876	Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma: A clinicopathologic study of 8 cases	Objective: To investigate clinicopathologic features, immunophenotypes and differential diagnoses of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma/tumor (FDCS). Methods: Eight cases of FDCS were studied using histological and immunohistochemical examinations and EBER in situ hybridization, with a review of the related literatures. Results: There were 5 male and 3 female patients with a median age of 50 years. The sites of involvement included lymph node (4 cases), tonsil, nasopharynx, liver, and spleen (1 case each, respectively). The predominant microscopic features histologically included storiform, fascicular, diffuse, whorled and nodular in patterns. The neoplastic cells, dispersed by the infiltrated small lymphocytes, were characterized by abundant eosinophilic or fine granular cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders, and syncytial in appearance. The nuclei of the tumors were ovoid, round to spindled in shape with vesicular or stippled chromatin and small distinct nucleoli. Mitotic figures varied among cases. Pseudovascular spaces and perivascular cuffing were observed in some cases. One case of FDCS involving lesion in liver showed a background of abundant lymphocytes mixing with dispersed spindle or ovoid neoplastic cells having delicate chromatin, mild nuclear atypia, irregular/vesicular nuclei and distinct nucleoli. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD21, CD35, clusterin, and weakly positive for CD68, EMA, S-100 and EGFR. Ki-67 stain showed a variable expression among cases. EBER was positive in 2 cases. Conclusions: FDCS is a rare malignant tumor with a tendency to relapse and metastasis. Combined morphological and immunophenotypical analysis is necessary to reach a correct diagnosis.

55849105201	Clinicopathologic study of pilocytic astrocytoma	Objective: To study clinicopathologic features, treatment and prognosis of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). Methods: Histopathological, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical (EnVision method) and clinical features of 68 cases of PA were studied by microscopic investigation with correlation of clinical follow-up information when available. Results: Thirty-five male patients and 33 female patients were studied. The patient's age ranged from 3 to 66 years (mean = 20.1 years). The mean time from symptom onset to surgery was 371 days (range, 3 days to 14 years). Cystic degeneration was noted in 41 cases (60.3%), and enhancement of the tumor was noted in 43 cases (87.8%). On postcontrast imaging examination there were 33 cases involving the cerebellum (48.5%). Total tumor excision was performed in 35 patients, subtotal tumor excision was performed in 31 patients, and the procedures of other 2 patients were not clear. Among 51 patients with follow-up information, 44 were alive, 7 had recurrent tumor, and 7 died. The post-operative survival ranged from 2 months to 124 months (mean survival = 48.1 months). Five years and ten years survival rates were 89%, respectively. Tumors with classic histopathology demonstrated biphasic pattern of growth, consisting of compact elongated bipolar astrocytes associated with rosenthal fibers, and less cellular areas of multipolar cells with granular bodies and microcyst. Some cases showed atypia of nuclei, and occasional mitoses. Involvement of subarachnoid space was seen in 17 cases. One case had anaplastic features. All cases showed diffuse positive staining for GFAP and low expression for Ki-67, except 1 anaplastic tumor with 10% Ki-67 indices. Tumors with subarachnoid space involvement showed positive reticular fiber staining and negative EMA staining. Conclusions: PA is a benign, WHO grade I tumor with favorable prognosis, and does not require radiotherapy after total resection. The tumor can be mistaken as higher-grade astrocytoma when involving the subarachnoid space, and with cytological atypia, leading to unnecessary radiotherapy after surgery. Recurrence rate is increased when only partial resection is achieved. The outcome for patients with brainstem tumor or anaplastic PA is poor.

54249146058	EphB1 is underexpressed in poorly differentiated colorectal cancers	Background: Over- or underexpression of certain Eph receptors has been associated with tumorigenesis of some types of cancer. EphB1 is a member of receptor tyrosine kinases of the EphB subfamily involved in the development, progress and prognosis of colorectal cancers. The expression levels of EphB1 in colon cancer cell lines and human colorectal carcinoma specimens were determined and association of EphB1 expression with clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Methods: Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used. Results: The EphB1 transcript is expressed in all colon cancer cell lines tested. However, there is marked variability in the expression of the EphB1 transcripts and proteins among colorectal carcinoma specimens. Reduced expression of EphB1 in colorectal cancers more often occurred in poorly differentiated and mucinous adenocarcinomas than in well- and moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. Further, cancer cells with a low level of EphB1 protein showed more invasive power. Conclusion: Our data indicate that EphB1 may have roles in the pathogenesis and development of colorectal cancer.

58149174073	Downregulation of EphA1 in colorectal carcinomas correlates with invasion and metastasis	The Eph gene family has important roles in the developmental processes and may also be involved in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of certain types of cancers. In the present study, quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR was performed to detect the expression of EphA1 transcript in 5 colon cancer cell lines and 75 colorectal carcinomas. Immunohistochemical staining was used to check the expression of EphA1 protein in 20 colorectal adenomas and in 111 colorectal carcinomas specimens. EphA1 protein expression was not completely consistent with transcript expression. EphA1 protein was expressed in all adenomas and reduced in 54% colorectal cancers. Reduced expression of EphA1 protein occurred more often in male patients (P=0.028) and in patients with poor differentiation (P=0.027), greater depth of wall invasion (P=0.003), lymph node metastasis (P=0.034), and advanced tumor stage (P=0.003). Patients with reduced EphA1 expression had a poor overall survival (P=0.059). Reduced EphA1 expression in patients over 55 years or with rectal cancers and sigmoid colon cancers is associated with a poor overall survival (P=0.034 and 0.015, respectively). Our data indicate that the EphA1 may play different roles during the different stages of colorectal carcinoma progression. © 2009 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

64849084248	Fluoride and children's intelligence: A meta-analysis	This paper presents a systematic review of the literature concerning fluoride that was carried out to investigate whether fluoride exposure increases the risk of low intelligence quotient (IQ) in China over the past 20 years. MEDLINE, SCI, and CNKI search were organized for all documents published, in English and Chinese, between 1988 and 2008 using the following keywords: fluorosis, fluoride, intelligence, and IQ. Further search was undertaken in the website www.fluorideresearch.org because this is a professional website concerning research on fluoride. Sixteen case-control studies that assessed the development of low IQ in children who had been exposed to fluoride earlier in their life were included in this review. A qualitative review of the studies found a consistent and strong association between the exposure to fluoride and low IQ. The meta-analyses of the case-control studies estimated that the odds ratio of IQ in endemic fluoride areas compared with nonfluoride areas or slight fluoride areas. The summarized weighted mean difference is -4.97 (95%confidence interval [CI]∈=∈-5.58 to -4.36; p∈<∈0.01) using a fixed-effect model and -5.03 (95%CI∈=∈-6.51 to 3.55; p∈<∈0.01) using a random-effect model, which means that children who live in a fluorosis area have five times higher odds of developing low IQ than those who live in a nonfluorosis area or a slight fluorosis area. © 2008 Humana Press Inc.

67649544796	Clinicopathological study of 5 cases of proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma	Objective To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics, diagnosis and differential diagnoses of proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma ( PES). Methods Five cases of PES were retrieved from pathology files. Clinical, pathologic and immunohistochemical features of the tumors were reviewed. Results One patient was female and 4 were male. Ages of the patients ranged from 19 to 46 years. The sites of the tumor involvement were vulvar (2 cases) , hypogastric zone (1 case) , anterosuperior iliac spine ( 1 case) and buttock (1 case). Clinically, the tumor masses were painless and progressive solitary nodules. Microscopically, the tumor cell growth was infiltrative in nature, nodular in appearnce with degenerative and necrotic cells at the central areas. The tumors consisted of relatively uniform epithelioid cells with round or oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for vimentin (5/5), CK (4/5) , EMA (4/5) , p-catenin (3/5) , CD34 (3/5) , and S-100 protein (1/5) , but were negative for SMA, MyoDl, Desmin, HMB45, CK7 and CK20. Conclusion Definitive diagnosis of PES relies on its histopathological characteristics in conjunction with appropriate immunohistochemical findings.

67650091663	Lornoxicam suppresses recurrent herpetic stromal keratitis through down-regulation of nuclear factor-κb: An experimental study in mice	Purpose: We designed the current study to determine the protective effects of lornoxicam, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, on recurrent herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated mechanism in mice. Methods: A corneal latent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infected mouse model was established. Six weeks later, Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation induced the recurrence. Corneal swabs were obtained and cultured with indicator cells to determine shedding of the virus. Lornoxicam was administered intraperitoneally daily, beginning one day before irradiation and lasting for seven days. Saline-treated and mock-infected control groups were also studied at the same time. Development of corneal inflammation and opacity was scored. Immunohistochemical staining and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed to evaluate the effect of lornoxicam on NF-κB activation in the corneal tissues. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the cornea were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: HSV-1 reactivation induced stromal edema and opacification concomitantly with elevated activation of NF-κB and elevated production of TNF-α. Lornoxicam treatment significantly decreased the incidence of recurrent HSK, attenuated the corneal opacity scores, and also effectively suppressed both NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression in biological analysis. Histopathology examination revealed a reduced immunostaining positive cell density for NF-κB in the cornea from lornoxicam-treated mice as well as a diminished inflammatory response. Conclusions: Lornoxicam exerts protective effects against HSK, presumably through the down-regulation of NF-κB activation. © 2009 Molecular Vision.

67651159057	Primary adenosquamous carcinoma of the colon: Report of five cases	Primary adenosquamous cell carcinomas (Ad-SCCs) of the colon and rectum are rare malignancies with a poor prognosis, in comparison to adenocarcinoma alone. Different roles of human papilloma virus (HPV) in its pathogenesis have been reported and the role of P16 in Ad-SCCs has not been explored. This report presents five cases of Ad-SCC of the colon to explore the clinicopathological features and the roles of P16, HPV 6/11, and 16/18. There was no confirmed evidence to support the relationship between the infection of HPV 6/11, 16/18, and pathogenesis of Ad-SCC of the colon. P16 overexpression was not related to HPV carcinogenesis and there might be another mechanism of P16 upregulation in Ad-SCC of the colon. © 2009 Springer.

70349124641	Prognostic significance and grading of stromal invasion in pT1 adenocarcinoma of lung	Objective: To study the prognostic significance of grading system for stromal invasion in pathologic tumor stage T1 (pT1) adenocarcinoma of lung. Methods: Eighty-five cases of surgically resected pT1 lung adenocarcinoma with clinicopathologic and follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed. The degree of invasive growth was classified into three grades according to its location in the tumor. The clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic significance were analyzed. Results: Amongst the 85 cases studied, 17 cases (20%) were in grade 1, 12 (14%) in grade 2 and 56 (66%) in grade 3. The tumor size was smaller and lymphovascular permeation was less frequently encountered in cases with grade 1 stromal invasion than in those with grade 3 ( P= 0.005 for tumor size and P = 0.018 for occurrence of lymphovascular permeation). The rate of lymph node metastasis and pathologic staging in cases with grade 1 and grade 2 were similar and were significantly lower than those with grade 3 (P = 0.007 for rate of lymph node metastasis in grade 1 versus grade 3 tumors, P = 0.002 for padiologic stage in grade 1 versus grade 3 tumors, P = 0.027 for rate of lymph node metastasis in grade 2 versus grade 3 tumors and P = 0.021 for pathologic stage in grade 2 versus grade 3 tumors). There was no statistically significant difference with respect to age, gender and smoking history of the patients, amongst cases in different grades. The overall five-year survival rate was 63%. The five-year survival rates for cases with grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 were 100%, 83.3% and 46.6%, respectively. The difference between cases with grade 2 and grade 3 was statistically significant (P = 0.027). The death rate during follow-up for cases with grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 were 0, 16.7% and 42.9%, respectively. The difference between cases with grade 1 and grade 3 was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that grade of stromal invasion (P = 0.001), pathologic stage (P < 0.001), presence of lymphovascular permeation (P < 0.001) and lymph node involvement (P < 0.001) represented important prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis also showed that pathologic stage (P < 0.001) was an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: The grading system of stromal invasion in pulmonary adenocarcinoma correlates with tumor prognosis and other prognostic factors. It represents a useful criterion in prognostic categorization of pT1 adenocarcinoma of lung.

70349428811	Tanycytic ependymoma: Two case reports and review of the literature	Two cases of tanycytic ependymoma are reported, one in a woman aged 33 years and one in a man aged 36 years. The woman presented with lesions at L2 and L3 in the spinal cord and clinical symptoms suggested spinal cord compression, such as movement and sensory dysfunction. The man had a lesion located in the lateral ventricle and presented with headache, vomiting, and impaired vision. Both of these patients developed gradual increases in the intensity of their symptoms over a few months prior to admission. A spinal cord MRI of the woman showed a well-defined, solid cystic mass measuring 1.0 × 6.5 cm at L2 and L3 of the spinal cord. The mass showed low signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the intervertebral disc with equal signal intensity T1-/T2-weighted images. The signal was uniform and enhanced scanning showed a light strengthening of signal. A brain MRI of the man showed a well-defined mass measuring 4 cm in diameter invading the right ventricle. The mass showed low signal intensity on right T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Histopathologically, the tumors were rich with significant and uniform proliferation of long spindle cells, which were arranged in fasciculate and knitted patterns with bipolar and spindled processes focally forming perivascular pseudorosettes. The cell nuclei showed minor pleomorphism. A few tumor cells centered on the vessels resulted in a nuclear-free zone, which was characteristic of ependymoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for GFAP, EMA, and CD99, but negative for S-100. A review of the cases reported in the literature shows that tanycytic ependymoma occurs more often in the spinal cord. As it can resemble pilocytic astrocytoma and schwannoma, tanycytic ependymoma should be differentially diagnosed to exclude some of the benign spindle cell tumors of the central nervous system. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2009.

74249105384	NK/T-cell lymphoma in a child with hypersensitivity to mosquito bites	Hypersensitivity to mosquito bite (HMB) is defined as intense skin reactive lesion after mosquito bite. However, some kind of malignant tumor is closely associated with HMB, especially natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma. We described a nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma in a 9-year-old girl after a history of 2 years earlier of HMB. Pathologic evaluation revealed the typical histologic features of NK/T-cell lymphoma, and the dermal and subcutaneous inflammatory reaction of HMB lesions. HMB is rarely reported and should be kept in mind as a clinical sign of subsequent NK/T-cell lymphoma in Asian country where HMB is relatively frequently encountered.

76549099970	Expression and clinical significance of kidney injury molecule-1 in renal epithelial neoplasms	Objective To study the expression and clinical significance of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-I) in primary and metastatic renal epithelial neoplasms. Methods A total of 136 cases of kidney neoplasms were retrospectively reviewed including 63 primary clear cell renal cell carcinomas ( RCCs ) , 22 papillary RCCs, 13 chromophobe RCCs, 7 oncocytomas, 7 RCCs associated with Xp11. 2 translocation/ TFE3 gene fusions and 24 metastatic clear cell RCCs. Immunostaining for KIM-I and kidney-specific-protein (Ksp)-Cadherin were performed and the relationship to tumor stage and grade in clear cell RCCs was investigated. Results Expression of KIM-I was detected in 77. 8% (49/63) of clear cell RCCs, 90. 9% (20/22) of papillary RCCs, 1/13 of chromophobe RCCs, 7/7 of RCCs associated with Xp11. 2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusions and 87. 5% (21/24) of the metastatic RCCs, but not detected in 7 cases of oncocytomas. A diffuse expression of KIM-I was more frequently observed in Furhman nuclear grade ffi/IV clear cell RCCs (P = 0.010). Ksp-cadherin expression was mainly observed in chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas. Conclusions KIM-I is a specific biomarker for injuried kidney proximal tubules and the corresponding neoplasms, and has a high specificity and sensitivity for primary or metastatic clear cell RCCs, papillary RCCs and RCCs associated with Xp 11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusions. Combination of KIM-I and Ksp-cadherin immunostaining can lead to a more precise histological classification of primary kidney epithelial neoplasms and improve the diagnostic accuracy of metastatic RCCs.

77950192512	Clinicopathologic study of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome-related and sporadic hemangioblastomas of central nervous system	Objective To study clinicopathologic features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome-related and sporadic hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system (CNS-HB). Methods Histopathological, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical (EnVision method) and clinical features of 21 VHL syndrome and 63 sporadic CNS-HB cases were studied with correlation of the available follow-up information. Results Twenty-one VHL patients accompanied with a total of 87 CNS-HBs, including one patient of developing 12 HBs within 13 years. There were 10 patients presenting other lesions related to VHL, including 6 retinal HBs, 4 pancreatic tumors (endocrine tumor and microcystic cystadenoma), 1 clear renal cell carcinoma, 4 renal cysts and 1 endolymphatic sac tumor. One patient developed 5 different tumors related to VHL within a period of 4 years. In the 63 cases of sporadic CNS-HB (34 male and 29 female), the mean age was 43. 0 years. Among the 18 VHL syndrome patients with available follow-up information, 14 were still alive and within them, 4 became disabled and 11 had developed new lesions. The other 4 patients died. Among the 42 patients of sporadic HB with follow-up information, 39 were alive including 3 disabled cases, and the other 3 died. Histologically, the tumors showed large and vacuolated stromal cells. Some tumors showed atypical nuclei. Involvement of the brain tissue was seen in 32 cases, among which, 21 patients with available follow-up information were learnt to be alive. Tumor cells of HB stained positive for vimentin, EGFR, Inhibin a and D2-40, but negative for CD34 and CD68. In 3 cases of HB, some stromal cells were positive for GFAP. All cases showed a low expression for Ki-67, except 2 cases with 2% and 1 case with 5% Ki-67 indices. Conclusions VHL syndrome is a multisystem disorder with a poor prognosis and a high rate of missed diagnosis. The syndrome is characterized by development of various benign and malignant tumors. The most common tumor is CNS-HB, which occurs predominandy in the cerebellum. Patients with VHL syndrome tend to present at a younger age than patients with sporadic CNS-HBs, and VHL related HB occurs more predominantly in the brain stem and spinal cord. Prognosis of CNS-HB patients is not correlated with the nuclear atypicality, expression for Ki-67 and involvement of the brain tissue. Because new lesions may develop during the patient's lifetime. So that, regular clinical inspection is recommended in order to check up the development of any new lesions.

77952196879	Molecularly genetic analysis of von Hippel-Lindau associated central nervous system hemangioblastoma	Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, characterized by development of a variety of neoplasms in multiple organs. Central nervous system hemangioblastoma (CHB) is the most common manifestation of VHL disease. The germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene are responsible for the inherited cancer predisposition syndrome. To expand the VHL mutation data and to investigate the tumorigenesis of VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastoma, 24 CHB tissue samples and blood samples of 14 patients from 10 Chinese VHL families were collected and subjected to molecular genetic analysis. Six distinctive germline mutations were identified, and the 601 G to C (Val130Phe) mutation is reported for the first time. Somatic mutations analysis of the VHL gene in VHL-associated CHB showed that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurred in more than half of the cases. In addition, expression of the ZAC1 tumor suppressor gene protein was studied using immunohistochemistry staining in CHB tissues with a specific polyclonal antibody. The ZAC1 protein was lost in all CHB. Our data exhibited high frequency of LOH of ZAC1 gene in VHL-associated CHB, indicating that ZAC1 may have a role in tumorigenesis of VHL-associated CHB. © 2010 Japanese Society of Pathology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

77952927437	Expression analysis of Wnt-5a in renal epithelial neoplasms: Distinguishing renal oncocytoma from a wide spectrum of renal cell carcinomas	Objective. To study the expression of a novel marker, Wnt-5a, in renal epithelial neoplasms and determine its clinicopathological significance. Methods. Immunohistochemical analysis of Wnt-5a was carried out in normal human kidney samples as well as in 123 primary renal epithelial neoplasms including 37 clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), 24 papillary RCCs (15 type 1 and 9 type 2), 25 chromophobe RCCs, 11 Xp11 translocation carcinomas, 6 mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinomas, and 20 oncocytomas. Results. Wnt-5a was expressed in 18.9% (7/37) of clear cell RCCs, 12.5% (3/24) of papillary RCCs, 16% (4/25) of chromophobe RCCs, 18.2% (2/11) of Xp11 translocation carcinomas, 0% (0/6) of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinomas, and 100% (20/20) of oncocytomas. There was a significant difference in Wnt-5a immunohisto-chemistry between renal oncocytoma and the other subtypes of RCC (P <0.01). Conclusions. Our results indicate that Wnt-5a is a potentially useful immunohisto-chemical marker for the complex differential diagnosis between oncocytoma and other subtypes of RCC and also suggest that Wnt-5a may be a tumor suppressor gene in RCC.

77956204113	Expression and correlation of Ezrin and survivin in non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: The aim of this study was to explore expression and correlation of Ezrin and survivin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Expression of Ezrin and survivin were detected and analyzed by Envision method of immunohistochemical staining in 86 NSCLC. Results: The strong expression rate of Ezrin in NSCLC was 60.5% and significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), but no associated with gender, histologic subtype, TNM stages, differentiation and smoking. Meanwhile, the positive expression rate of survivin in NSCLC was 65.1% and significantly correlated with TNM stages and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), but no associated with gender, histologic subtype, differentiation and smoking. And expression of Ezrin and survivin were positively correlated in NSCLC (r = 0.384). Conclusion: Ezrin and survivin may play synergetic roles in the process of carcinogenesis of NSCLC, and their expression may be significantly associated with NSCLC metastasis. Detection of Ezrin and survivin may be valuable for diagnosing lung cancer metastasis and providing evidence for clinical treatment. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77956873108	Endolymphatic sac tumor with von Hippel-Lindau disease: Report of a case with analysis of von Hippel-Lindau gene and review	Endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs) are very rare and locally aggressive low-grade neoplasm of endolymphatic system origin, which are associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Evidence suggests that the specific VHL alteration influences the phenotype. Because of the rarity of ELSTs, only a small number of cases have been subjected to molecular genetic analysis. The correlation between ELSTs and the genotype of VHL remains unclear. Herein, we reported a case of ELST with VHL gene analysis who presented with a family history of VHL disease. The radiologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of the tumor were typical of ELST. Using the polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism sequencing techniques, a germline mutation was identified as IVS1 + 1G→A at position 553 + 1. The mutation found in this case has not been previously reported in ELSTs. It is hoped that the study would contribute to a better understanding of ELSTs and the correlation between ELSTs and the genotype of VHL. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77957192562	Clinicopathologic and molecular genetic study of renal cell carcinoma occurring in teenagers	Objective To investigate clinicopathological features,molecular genetic characteristics, differential diagnoses and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma in teenagers. Methods Microscopic and immunohistochemical features of 46 cases of renal cell carcinomas in teenagers were reviewed along with the clinical follow-up data. Loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) , analysis of von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene and screening for VHL gene mutations were performed in all of the tumors. Results There were 19 Xp11. 2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions renal clear cell carcinomas ( Xp11 RCCs ) , 9 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (CCRCCs), 17 papillary renal cell carcinomas (PRCCs), and 1 unclassified renal cell carcinoma ( RCC). All of the 19 XpIl. 2 translocation RCCs showed a moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFE, however, no TFEB expression was obtained. There were 4 histological patterns in the Xp11 RCC cases including: 8 tumors possessing a nested to papillary architecture resembling to the t(X;17) ASPLTFE3 phenotype ; 6 tumors possessing a morphologic feature like the t ( X ; 1 ) PRCC-TFE3 phenotype ; 4 cases morphologically resembling to clear cell RCC case and 1 Xp11 RCC case, with a special morphologic feature not searched yet in the literature, including a ground glass appearance of the nuclei accompanying occasionally with grooves on the nuclear surface; nucleoli inconspicuous with accumulation of abundant mucin-like substance in the stroma. VHL gene analysis revealed deletions at 3p25-26 in one clear cell RCC and one papillary type 2 RCC. The papillary type 2 RCC had also a family history of VHL disease, with a germline C→C mutation at a splicing site of position 553 + 5. There were no VHL mutations detected in the remaining 45 RCCs. Statistical analysis of tumor stage and outcome revealed that TFE + RCCs of teen-agers were more frequently associated with a higher pT3/pT4 stage and a poorer outcome than that of the TFE-RCCs(P <0. 05). Conclusions RCCs of the teenagers have a different morphologic spectrum and genetic background from the RCCs seen in adults. Among RCCs of the teen-agers, Xp11. 2 translocation tumors are the most common RCCs and have a poorer prognosis than that of the TFE-RCCs.

78649402747	Expression of EphA1 in gastric carcinomas is associated with metastasis and survival	Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Eph subfamily are involved in the development and the carcinogenesis of certain cancers. In this study we investigated expression of EphA1 in gastric carcinomas, and analyzed associations between EphA1 expression and clinicopathological parameters to investigate the role of EphA1 in gastric carcinoma. The level of EphA1 transcript expression in gastric carcinoma tissue and corresponding normal tissue was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The status of the CpG island associated with the promoter region of EphA1 was assessed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and EphA1 protein expression of was examined by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Down-regulation of EphA1 transcripts was detected in 34% of the cases, up-regulation in 25% of the cases, and no difference in expression in 41% of the cases. The EphA1 transcript expression level was associated with tumor size (P=0.05), stage (P=0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.011). Methylated EphA1 DNA was detected in most of the carcinomas with EphA1 down-regulation that were examined. EphA1 protein expression was associated with depth of wall invasion (P=0.069), stage (P<0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.018). The survival analysis showed that patients whose tumor exhibited EphA1 upregulation had a poorer outcome than those whose tumor exhibited down-regulation (P=0.005) or no difference in expression (P=0.003). EphA1 may have roles in invasion and metastasis by gastric carcinoma. The EphA1 expression level is a potential prognostic marker in gastric carcinoma, and the EphA1 gene may provide a novel target of therapy for gastric carcinoma.

79953873304	Renal cell carcinoma in children and young adults: Clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and VHL gene analysis of 46 cases with follow-up	To further study the characteristics of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in young patients and better define their biological features, 46 RCCs of patients younger than 25 years were morphologically and immunohistochemically characterized with follow-up. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene region and screening for VHL gene mutations were performed in all tumors. Applying the 2004 WHO classification for RCC, there were 19 Xp11.2 translocation RCCs, 9 clear cell RCCs, 17 papillary RCCs, and 1 unclassified RCC. All 19 Xp11.2 translocation RCCs showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFE3. None had TFEB immunoreactivity. One Xp11.2 translocation RCC had an unreported morphology with empty or ground glass nuclei, occasional nuclear grooves, inconspicuous nucleoli and abundant mucinous material in stroma.VHL gene analysis revealed deletions at 3p25-26 in 1 clear cell RCC and 1 papillary type 2 RCC. The papillary type 2 RCC was also presented with a family history of VHL disease and found a germline mutation G → C on a splicing site at position 553+5. The present case widens the spectrum of microscopic features to be found in VHL-associated RCC. There were no VHL mutations in the remaining 45 RCCs. Statistical analysis of stage and outcome revealed that TFE+ pediatric RCCs were significantly more frequently associated with a higher pTNM pT3/pT4 stage and a poorer outcome than TFE-RCCs (P <.05). Owing to the already known aggressive behavior of these Xp11.2 translocation RCCs, patients with TFE+ pediatric RCCs should benefit from a stricter follow-up. © The Author(s) 2011.

80052732200	Primary peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma: A clinical and pathological study	Primary peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma (PPSPC) is a rare primary tumor of the peritoneum that found predominantly in elderly and post-menopausal women. The aim of our study is to review the clinical and pathologic information of 22 patients, and then try to summarize clinical behavior and pathological characteristics of PPSPC, in order to be better recognized of this entity in future. We retrospectively reviewed the data from 22 patients with PPSPC treated at our hospital from 1992 to 2008. All paraffin blocks were recut for periodic acid-Schiff diastase and immunohistochemical staining for CD15, cytokeratin7(CK7), cytokeratin20(CK20), S-100 protein, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA125, estrogen receptor(ER) and progesterone receptor(PR). The median age of the patients at the time of surgical staging was 56 years (range, 32-77 years). The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distension (59.1%) and ascites (63.6%). Pretreatment CA125 levels were significant elevated in 90.5% patients. Optimal debulking was performed in 18 patients. All patients were consequently treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Response to treatment is promising, and the median overall survival of all patients was 21.0 months (95% CI 16.9, 25.1 months). The positive rate of immunohistochemical staining was CD15 95.5%, CK7 90.9%, S-100 protein 68.2%, CA125 59.1%, CK20 31.8%, ER 31.8%, CEA 27.3% and PR 9.1%, respectively. Gynecologist should be aware of PPSPC when abdominal distension, gross ascites and a raised level of CA125 in women without ovarian enlargement. Immunohistochemical staining might be helpful as accessory criteria for the differential diagnosis among the PPSPC, peritoneal malignant mesothelioma (PMM), primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma (PEOC) and peritoneal carcinomatosis from the gastrointestinal tumors (SPCGT). Cytoreductive surgery combined with pre/postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy may be effective for PPSPC patients. © 2011 Arányi Lajos Foundation.

84859798713	Prognostic Significance of a newly Proposed grading and scoring system in stage I Pulmonary adenocarcinoma	Objective To evaluate the prognostic significance of a new grading and scoring system (based on the new IASLC/ATS/ERS classification) in stage I pulmonary adenocarcinoma, as compared with the WHO grading system. Methods The clinicopathologic characteristics of 125 patients with stage I pulmonary adenocarcinoma primarily treated by surgical resection were reviewed retrospectively. All cases were classified according to the new IASLC/ATS/ERS classification and graded into three prognostic groups based on the new classification, the Sica scoring system and the WHO grading system, respectively. The differences in prognosis of the three groups were analyzed. Results There was a statistically significant correlation between the new grading system and the WHO grading system (P=O. 000). Both of them showed negative correlation with overall survival. The new scoring system however better correlated with disease recurrence and/or metastasis (P = O. 855, P=O. 073 versus P = 0. 011 ). According to univariate Log-rank test, the prognosis correlated with tumor size (P= 0. 004 ) , clinical stage (P= 0. 000 ), the WHO grading ( P = 0. 020 ), the new grading system (P= 0. 000 ), the new scoring system (P= 0. 000 ), vascular invasion (P= 0.021), and recurrence and/or metastasis (P= 0.000). The Cox regression analysis demonstrated that clinical stage ( P = 0. 014 ), the new grading system (P=O. 047 ) the new scoring system (P=O. 043 ), and recurrence and/or metastasis ( P = 0. 018 ) were significantly independent poor prognostic factors. Conclusions The new grading and scoring system shows good correlation with the WHO grading system. Compared with the WHO grading system, the new scoring system based on the new IASLC/ATS/ ERS classification provides valuable information in categorizing stage I pulmonary adenocarcinoma cases with different risks of disease recurrence, tumor metastasis and prognosis.

84860311708	High thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) expression is a predictor of poor survival in patients with pT1 of lung adenocarcinoma	In this study, we explore the association of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) expression in tumour tissues with clinical pathological parameters and prognosis in patients with pathological T1 (pT1) lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of TK1 was studied by immunohistochemistry techniques in 80 patients with surgically resected pT1 lung adenocarcinoma, retrospectively and at >10-year follow-up. Compared to patients with low TK1 expression [labelling index (LI) <25.0%], patients with high TK1 expression (LI ≥25.0%) showed significantly increased lymphatic/vascular permeation and lymph node involvement and higher stromal invasion grade and pathological stage, and a greater number of patients had a tumour size of 2.1 to 3.0 cm. The 5-year survival and the mortality during follow-up for patients with high TK1 expression were significantly worse than that of patients with low TK1 expression. The prognoses of the cases with grade 0, grade 1 and grade 2 stromal invasions were similar and were better than those of cases with grade 3. In patients with stromal invasion grade 3, the 5-year survival and the mortality during follow-up were significantly worse for patients with high TK1 compared to patients with low TK1 expression. Univariate analyses showed that stromal invasion and TK1 expression were significant prognostic factors, while in the multivariate analysis, TK1 expression and tumour stage were found to be independent prognostic factors, but not stromal invasion. This is the first study showing that TK1 expression in combination with stromal invasion is a more reliable prognostic factor than stromal invasion classification itself in patients with pT1 lung adenocarcinoma. TK1 expression enables a further classification of the patients and opens opportunities for improved treatment outcome. © International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM) 2011.

84865503164	Renal cell carcinomas with t(6;11)(p21;q12): A clinicopathologic study emphasizing unusual morphology, novel alpha-TFEB gene fusion point, immunobiomarkers, and ultrastructural features, as well as detection of the gene fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization	Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with t(6;11)(p21;q12) are extremely rare and characterized by specific chromosome translocation, involving the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Fewer than 30 cases have been described in the literature. We examined 7 additional cases of this rare tumor by clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, molecular, and ultrastructural analyses. Four tumors had the typical morphologic features of TFEB RCCs, whereas 3 cases demonstrated uncommon morphologic features, mimicking epithelioid angiomyolipoma, chromophobe cell RCC, and clear cell RCC, respectively. Immunohistochemically, aside from TFEB and cathepsin K, kidney-specific cadherin was another sensitive and relatively specific marker for TFEB RCCs, supporting a distal nephron origin for these renal tumors. We also observed different ultrastructures including mitochondrion with areas of lipofuscin pigment in the smaller cells in these cases. An identical Alpha-TFEB fusion gene, 486 bp, was identified in 2 cases. In addition to the polymerase chain reaction method, we also developed a fluorescence in situ hybridization assay to serve as a cost-effective and time-efficient diagnostic tool. We detected a TFEB gene rearrangement in all 7 cases using the fluorescence in situ hybridization method. TFEB RCC seemed to be an indolent tumor. During a mean follow-up of 31 months, none of the cases developed tumor recurrence, progression, or metastasis. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84866271621	Downregulation of miR-195 correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer	miR-195, one of the miR-16/15/195/424/497 family members, has been shown to play an important role in tumorigenesis, as a tumor suppressor. Here, we assess miR-195 expression in colorectal cancer, which has not been investigated before, and its clinical significance including survival analysis. The in vivo significance of expression of miR-16/15/195/424/497 in matched normal and tumor tissues of colorectal cancers was evaluated using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Two colorectal cancer cell lines and 85 colorectal cancer and paired normal patient samples with detailed clinical follow-up information were selected. The statistical significance of these markers for disease prognosis was evaluated using a twotailed, paired Wilcoxon test. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was generated following a logrank test. As a result, miR-424 was significantly over-expressed, while miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, and miR-195 were downregulated in tumors compared with normal colorectal samples (all P<0.01). Reduced expression of miR-195 occurred more often in patients with lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor stage (all P<0.01). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with reduced miR-195 had a poor overall survival (P<l0.01). Moreover, the multivariate analysis showed that reduced expression of miR-195 was an independent predictor of overall survival. Our data indicate the potential of miR-195 as a novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for CRC. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84871668706	High expression of EphA1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced disease	Eph receptors play important roles in the development of cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of EphA1 and its clinicopathologic significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The expression levels of the EphA1 transcript and protein were compared between ESCC and matched normal mucosa in the same patient. High expression levels of the EphA1 transcript and protein were detected in 25.6% (21/82) and 23.2% (19/82) of tumors compared with matched normal mucosa. The up-regulation of EphA1 transcript in tumors was positively associated with differentiation (p = 0.002), disease stage (p = 0.034), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.042). Increased expression of EphA1 protein in tumors was more often observed in patients with well-differentiated tumors (p = 0.004), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.028), and advanced tumor stage (p = 0.008). EphA1 protein expression was detected in intraepithelial neoplasias as well. Decreased expression of EphA1 protein was detected in 65.2% (15/23) of samples with low-grade neoplasia and in 85.3% (8/15) of samples with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Increased staining of EphA1 protein was not detected in low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia samples, but was detected in 21.3% (2/15) of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia samples. Taken together, our results show that EphA1 appears to be a differentiation marker for esophageal squamous cells, and its increased expression is positively associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced disease stage. © 2012 APMIS.

84874195401	Cathepsin K expression in a wide spectrum of perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas): A clinicopathological study emphasizing extrarenal PEComas	Aims: Recent studies have demonstrated that cathepsin K seems to be a powerful marker in identifying renal perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas). However, the expression in extrarenal PEComas has not been well characterized due to their rare incidence. Our aim was to investigate the expression of cathepsin K in a wide spectrum of extrar-enal PEComas and evaluate its potential diagnostic usefulness in comparison with other commonly used markers. Methods and results: Twenty-three cases of PEComa (liver, n = 9; lung, n = 1; broad ligament of uterus, n = 1; vertex subcutaneous soft tissue, n = 1; abdominal wall, n = 1; and kidney, n = 10) were selected for study. All displayed a high percentage of cells with moderately to strongly positive reactions for cathepsin K (mean 91%; range 80-100%). HMB45, Melan-A and smooth muscle actin (SMA) were expressed in 78, 87 and 87% of cases, respectively, with various percentages of positive cells (mean, 34, 40 and 38%; range 0-80, 0-90 and 0-90%). Transcription factor E3 (TFE3) was expressed strongly in only three cases; none exhibited evidence of TFE3 gene fusion or amplification. Conclusions: Cathepsin K appears to be more powerful than other commonly used markers in diagnosing a wide spectrum of PEComas and distinguishing them from the majority of human cancers. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84876257282	Immunohistochemistry using epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-specific antibodies of dele746-a750 and l858r in lung adenocarcinomas	Objective: To evaluate the immunohistochemieal detection of epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) mutations using two EGFR mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies: deIE746-A750 and L858R. Methods: A total of 175 paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples previously genotyped by directive DNA sequencing were subject to immunostaining using delE746-A750 and L858R antibodies. Results: There was no significant difference of mutation detection between DNA sequence analysis and delE746-A750 and/or L858R immunostaining (33.7% vs 30.9%, P > 0. 05). The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of immunostaining using these two EGFR mutation-specific antibodies were 83.1%, 95.7%, 90.7% and 90.9%, respectively. Conclusion: With high sensitivity and good specificity, immunohistochemistry using EGFR mutationspecific monoclonal antibodies is an adequate, easy and cost-effective prescreening method to detect EGFR mutations using paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of lung adenocarcinomas.

84880414966	Immunohistochemical study of perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms	Objective: To study the clinicopathologic features, immunophenotype and genetic changes of perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComa). Methods: A total of 25 cases of PEComa located in various anatomic sites were selected for immunohistochemical staining (SP or En Vision method). TFE3 fluorescence in-situ hybridization was also performed to determine the TFE3 gene status. Results: The age of patient ranged from 21 to 61 years (mean =43 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.3. Histologically, 22 cases represented conventional angiomyolipomas, composed of a mixture of adipose tissue, spindle element, epithelioid smooth muscle cells and abnormal thick-walled blood vessels in various proportions. Three cases involving lung, soft tissue and broad ligament had subtle but distinctive morphologic features. Nested or sheet-like architecture with epithelioid or spindle cells was observed. Immunohistochemical study showed that HMB 45, melan A, smooth muscle actin and cathepsin K were expressed in 80% (20/25), 88% (22/25), 88% (22/25) and 100% (25/25) of PEComa, respectively. Within positive cases, the average proportion of positive tumor cells was 36%, 41%, 35% and 90% respectively for HMB 45, melan A, smooth muscle actin and cathepsin K. TFE3 was negative in all of the 22 renal and hepatic PEComa studied, while it was positive in the 3 cases of extra-hepatorenal PEComa. None of the 25 cases exhibited evidence of TFE3 gene fusion or amplification. Conclusions: Extra-hepatorenal PEComa have distinctive morphologic features and are associated with TFE3 overexpression. Cathepsin K immunostaining demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in PEComa, better than other commonly employed immunomarkers. This marker is thus useful in diagnosis of PEComa and distinction with other neoplasms.

84880325532	Immunostaining with EGFR mutation-specific antibodies: A reliable screening method for lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR mutation in biopsy and resection samples	Mutation analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is essential in determining the therapeutic strategy for lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with EGFR mutation-specific antibodies of del E746-A750 in exon 19 and L858R in exon 21 has been evaluated in resection specimens in a few studies but rarely in biopsy samples. A total of 169 cases (78 biopsies and 91 resected specimens) of lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation status predefined by direct DNA sequencing were histologically examined, and IHC was performed using EGFR mutation-specific antibodies of del E746-A750 and L858R. The cases with positive results by IHC but negative results by direct DNA sequencing were examined by amplified refractory mutation system. Our results showed that the frequency of EGFR mutations for both E746-A750 deletion and L858R mutation was 38.5% (65/169) by DNA sequencing or amplified refractory mutation system and 34.3% (58/169) by IHC in lung adenocarcinomas. Based on molecular test results, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of IHC using these 2 antibodies in all (biopsy/resection) cases were 87.7% (80%/94.3%), 99.0% (97.9%/100%), 98.3% (96%/100%), and 92.8% (88.7%/96.6%), respectively. Lung adenocarcinomas with a predominant acinar, papillary, lepidic, or solid growth pattern more often harbor EGFR mutation of del E746-A750 or L858R. In conclusion, the immunostaining with EGFR del E746-A750 and L858R mutation antibodies is a reliable screening method with high specificity and sensitivity for identifying the EGFR mutation in both resected and biopsied lung adenocarcinomas. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84882986437	Oncocytic papillary renal cell carcinoma: A clinicopathological study emphasizing distinct morphology, extended immunohistochemical profile and cytogenetic features	Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is traditionally classified into type 1 and type 2. Recently, an oncocytic variant of PRCC has been described. We report a series of 6 oncocytic renal papillary tumors (OPRCC) which tended to occur in older patients (mean, 56.8 years) with a male preference (male-to-female ratio is 5:1). All 6 patients are alive with no evidence of disease after initial resection, showing an indolent clinical behavior. Histologically, tumors exhibited predominant papillary structure with delicate fibrovascular cores. Papillae were lined by single layers of cells with large, deeply eosinophilic and finely granular cytoplasms and round regular nucleus. The phagocytosis of tumor cells was frequently and evidently seen in our cases that hemosiderin-laden tumor cells and foamy tumor cells were noticed in five and four cases respectively. All tumors were immunoreactive for racemase, vimentin, CD10, and MET and negative for CD117. While E-cadherin, EMA, and cytokeratin 7 exhibited variable immunopositivity. FISH analysis was performed in five of six cases and found heterogeneous results. Trisomy of chromosomes 7 was found in three cases and trisomy of chromosomes 17 in two cases. Loss of chromosome Y was noted in one of four tumors in male patients. MET gene status was also investigated by direct sequencing in all 6 cases and found no distinct mutation in any case. These results suggest that OPRCC shows distinct morphology, indolent clinical behavior, and similar immunohistochemical and cytogenetic features with PRCC, seems to be a variant in the PRCC group. Whether the strong expression of MET indicates a potential therapeutic target is still unknown and requires further investigation in clinical trials.

84884714004	Amplification of the telomerase RNA component gene as a new genetic marker for disease progression and prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Amplification of the human telomerase RNA component (TERC) gene was found in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, its roles in the progression and prognosis of ESCC have not been well understood. The amplification of TERC in normal mucosa, low-grade and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive ESCC samples were evaluated using a fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. The amplification of TERC invariably occurred in high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive ESCC, partially occurred in low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia specimens, and seldom occurred in normal mucosa. The average signal ratio of TERC to chromosome 3 centromere-specific probe (TERC/CSP3) was 1.00 ± 0.01 (average ± standard deviation) in normal mucosas, 1.01 ± 0.08 in low-grade intraepithelial neoplasias, 1.39 ± 0.26 in high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias, and 1.56 ± 0.41 in invasive ESCC. High TERC/CSP3 ratio was positively associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.005) and advanced tumor stage (P = 0.045). Patients with high amplification of TERC had poor survival (P = 0.01). The amplification of TERC could be used as a new genomic marker for disease progression and prognosis of ESCC. The amplified TERC gene may be a potential therapeutic target for ESCC. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.

84885439706	Composite hemangioendothelioma arising from the kidney: Case report with review of the literature	Reported herein is a medical curiosities vascular tumor primary arising from the kidney and exhibiting unique histopathological features. A 32-year-old woman underwent a total nephrectomy of right kidney because of a mass localized in the inferior pole. Distinct from other vascular lesions, on histology the tumor had a peculiar composite pattern, consisting of benign and malignant vascular components, which were haphazardly intermixed without any definite margins. The malignant component was composed of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (45%) and angiosarcoma (50%) with moderate differentiation. Immunohistochemically, the oval to cuboidal to spindle tumor cells expressed only endothelial markers (CD31, CD34 and factor VIII-related antigen). And the angiosarcomatous component was characterized by the presence of a greater proliferation index Ki-67. Unlike other epithelial tumors, smooth muscle actin (SMA), cytokeratin, EMA and S-100 were all negative in the epithelioid tumor cells. These findings led to the diagnosis of a low-grade vascular neoplasm with morphological features consistent with so-called composite hemangioendothelioma (CHE). At 11 month follow up the patient was alive, without evidence of tumor recurrence. CHE is an extremely rare vascular neoplasm, with borderline malignant potential, which mostly occurs in distal extremity of the limbs at the cutaneous level and, only 30 cases have been previously described until now. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CHE arising from the kidney and widens the spectrum of primary vascular tumors arising in the kidney.

84886899828	Clinicopathologic study of the atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors in the central nervous system	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinicopathological features of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) occurring in the central nervous system. METHODS: Nine cases of AT/RT of the central nervous system were studied by hematoxylin-eosin staining, cytochemical and the immunohistochemical staining with clinicopathologic features, imaging data and combining of the literature. RESULTS: In 9 patients, 7 cases were older then 15(77.8%) and 2 cases were younger than 15(22.2%), average age was 6 years old; The clinical symptoms were headache, vomiting or the offside body numbness, etc. Eight cases were supratentorial (88.9%); Imaging features of the tumor displied a solidcystic mass with obviously edema around. One of the patients had obvious annular wall around formation; Histologically, AT/RT was characterized by the presence of rhabdoid cells associated with variable components of epithelial, primitive neuroectoderma, myxoid and glioma components and so on. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated a strong positivity for Vim, GFAP, EMA and CKpan, but negative for INI1, CD117 and PLAP, Ki-67 proliferation index was more than 40%. CONCLUSIONS: AT/RT is a highly malignant tumor but rarely occurs in the CNS. It is more likely seen in children; The clinical manifestations of the lesion intracranial related symptoms, the tumor cells have differentiation histopathology and immunohistochemical phenotype; It is important to use immunohistochemical studies in correct dignosis, surgery is the main treatment method with chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell therapy, which can prolong survival time, but the prognosis is very poor.

84898057938	Loss of BRM expression is a frequently observed event in poorly differentiated clear cell renal cell carcinoma	Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the status of Brahma (BRM), a key SWI/SNF complex subunit, in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), and to analyse the histopathology, immunophenotype, molecular features and prognosis of the BRM-negative cases. Methods and results: We identified 19 cases of grade 4 tumours lacking BRM expression among 625 clear cell RCCs. All 19 cases exhibited features of poor differentiation: 13 showed pure poorly differentiated morphology, while six were composite tumours with an admixed typical low-grade component. Besides negative BRM expression, the immunophenotype of these cases was similar to clear cell RCC. VHL gene mutations were identified in nine of the 19 patients (47%). Chromosome 3p deletion was detected in 11 of 13 poorly differentiated RCCs and both areas of five of five composite tumours. All poorly differentiated tumour areas showed polysomy of chromosome 3. No losses or gains of chromosome 3 were observed in low-grade tumour areas of five of five composite RCCs. Conclusions: We have shown that loss of BRM expression is a common feature among poorly differentiated tumours in clear cell RCCs. We hypothesize that loss of BRM expression is involved in tumor de-differentiation in clear cell RCCs and may play an important role during tumour progression. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84899559069	Brain metastasis of ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma after a long-term disease free survival in an old adult	Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed of CD30-positive cells and now recognized as three different entities: primary cutaneous ALCL, primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive (ALK+) ALCL and primary ALK-negative (ALK-) ALCL. ALK+ ALCL is supposed to have a better prognosis than ALK- ALCL. It is rarely metastasized to other sites, especially to the central nervous system (CNS). Herein, we present a rare case of systemic ALK+ ALCL which metastasized to the brain after a long-term disease free survival in an adult. Neuroimaging revealed a well-enhanced mass in the left frontal lobe. And it was completely resected. The results of the pathological and immunohistochemical studies were consistent with the metastasized ALK+ ALCL. The clinical findings, pathologic characteristics and treatment are described.

84904787854	Clinicopathologic features of extrapulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathologic features, immunohistochemic phenotypes and genetic alterations of extrapulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) and the correlation with prognosis. Methods: Thirty cases of IMT with follow-up were analyzed morphologically and immunohistochemically. ALK FISH was also performed to determine the ALK gene status. Results: Patients ranged in age from 12 to 73 years (mean 43.4 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.0: 1. 1. The tumors were located in various anatomical sites including gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, kidney, pelvic, retroperitoneum, mediastinum etc. Histologically, the majority of cases were composed of spindled fibroblastic and myofibroblastic cells accompanied by an inflammatory infiltrate of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Most cases with aggressive behavior had features including prominent nucleoli and edematous myxoid background. Lymphohistiocytic reactions were usually absent Some cases showed multinucleation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitoses. One case demonstrated epithelioid morphology with round-to-epithelioid cells. The immunohistochemical study showed vimentin, SMA, CK, desmin, and ALK were expressed in 100% (30/30), 70% (21/30), 13% (4/30), 27% (8/30), and 27% (8/30) of IMT, respectively. Diffuse cytoplasmic ALK staining was detected in seven cases. One case (containing round-to-epithelioid cells) demonstrated ALK nuclear membrane staining, coupled with positive reaction for CD30 and negative reaction for LCA. EMA, CD34, CD117 and S-100 protein, and MyoDl were negative for all cases. Six ALK protein positive cases harbored ALK gene rearrangement, but not the remaining 22 cases. Follow-up data were available in 21 patients. After initial resection, 14 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, while 4 patients were alive with tumor recurrence and 3 patients died of the disease. Conclusions: Most IMT with aggressive behavior have features including prominent nucleoli, edematous myxoid background, and positive expression of ALK. Lymphohistiocytic reaction is usually absent. ALK may be a potential novel therapeutic target for IMT.

84907196993	Thymidine kinase 1 is a better prognostic marker than Ki-67 for pT1 adenocarcinoma of the lung	Objectives: The sensitivity and reliability of the biomarkers thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and Ki-67 were studied in relation to clinical features and prognosis of survival for pathological-T1 (pT1) lung adenocarcinoma patients. Methods: TK1 and Ki-67 expression was determined in 80 patients with pT1 adenocarcinoma of the lung and in 20 specimens from normal lung tissues, using immunohistochemistry. Results: TK1 was found in most lung tumor cells both in the cytoplasm and the nuclei. The positive labelling index (LI) for total TK1 was significantly higher than that for Ki-67. There was a significant correlation between the LI of total TK1 and lymph node metastasis, degree of tumor invasion and pathologic stages, which was not found for Ki-67. In addition, the overall 5-year survival of patients was statistically significant different between low and high levels of TK1 expression, but not in cases of Ki-67. A multivariate analysis revealed that expression of TK1, lymph node involvement and TNM pathology staging could serve as independent prognostic factors for the disease progression of pT1 lung adenocarcinoma patients. Conclusions: Compared with Ki-67, TK1 is a more reliable proliferation index in pT1 adenocarcinoma of lung, which can evaluate the invasion and the prognosis of tumor.

84919467121	PTK7 protein is decreased in epithelial ovarian carcinomas with poor prognosis	Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common tumor of ovary. PTK7 plays an important role in tumors. Till now, there is no report about the role of PTK7 in ovarian epithelial neoplasms. This study aims to investigate the expression of PTK7 protein in epithelial ovarian tumors, and its relationship with clinical pathological characteristics. In this study, immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of PTK7 protein in 14 samples of normal fallopian tube epithelium and 204 cases of epithelial ovarian tumor. The relationship between the expression of PTK7 and pathological indicators was statistically analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to analyze the prognosis. The expression of PTK7 was found in 92.86% (13/14) of normal fallopian tube epithelium and 45.10% (92/204) of epithelial ovarian tumor tissues. The expression level of PTK7 was significantly decreased from the benign, the intermediate type, to malignant ovarian epithelial tumors (P < 0.001), and decreased from the normal control group to serous carcinomas (P < 0.001). The expression of PTK7 was significantly different in type I and type II epithelial ovarian carcinomas (P < 0.001). PTK7 protein expression was associated with clinical stages (P = 0.038) and metastases (P = 0.038) in ovarian borderline serous tumors. PTK7 protein expression was associated with clinical stages (P = 0.011), WHO grading (P = 0.004), and MDACC grading (P < 0.001) in ovarian serous carcinomas. The survival analysis showed that patients with negative expression of PTK7 protein had a poorer outcome than those with positive expression (P = 0.017). These results indicate that PTK7 protein may be a tumor suppressor and a potential prognostic marker in ovarian serous carcinomas.
