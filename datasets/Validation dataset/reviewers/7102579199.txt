13944271787	Fast fractal image coding method using the characteristics of human vision system in DCT domain	Considering the characteristics of human visual system, this paper presents a plain block selecting standard in DCT domain based on visual acuity. This standard excels the frequently used block variance and SNR measurements. Based on the standard, the computational complexity of the fractal image compression is reduced by selecting out the uniform parts in the DCT domain and encoding output the direct current directly without any fractal matching. For encoding time further reducing, the frequency response of human visual system is introduced in the DCT domain to classify the picture blocks and similar blocks and the visual effects of the decoded images are guaranteed in the matching computation of redundancy filtering. Experiment shows that provided with the same compression ratio, the encoding time is greatly reduced with improved PSNR and much better visual effect.

1642536261	Parallel hybrid immune algorithm and its application to layout design	Packing and layout problems belong to NPC problems theoretically and they have extensive engineering applications practically. Parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) is relatively effective to solve this kind of problems. But there still exist two main defects, i.e. premature convergence and slow convergence rate. To overcome them, a parallel hybrid immune algorithm (PHIA) is proposed based on PGA. Introducing immunity theory into parallel genetic algorithm has double functions. The one is that immune selection operator can prevent the algorithm from premature. The other is that convergence rate can be accelerated by individual migration strategy between subpopulations based on the immune memory mechanism. In this algorithm, chaos initialization, adaptive crossover and mutation operators are adopted. And subpopulations are classified as several types according to the values of crossover and mutation probability. To be hybridized with the Powell method can further improve the local searching performance of the algorithm. Two examples on the layout design of satellite module and printed circuit board (PCB) show that PHIA is feasible and effective.

1642576271	Isomorphic and non-isomorphic layout patterns of packing problems	Packing problems are to study how to put objects into a limited area (e.g. a container) reasonably under given constraints and they belong to NPC problems theoretically. Because they have extensive engineering applications practically (such as layout design of spacecraft modules, vehicle, robot and submarine.), packing problems are being concerned more and more in recent years. The layout pattern refers to the relative position relationship between objects in layout scheme and it is one of the important aspects that deserve to be studied in a deep-going way. Taking the layout design of satellite cabins as the background, we study layout patterns of the packing problems. The relevant concepts are defined, such as isomorphic and non-isomorphic layout patterns, layout equivalence relation between objects. Relation matrix, pattern matrix and their transformations are introduced to represent layout patterns. The control zone of layout pattern and non-isomorphic degree are described. We also present methods of recognition and construction for isomorphic and non-isomorphic patterns. At the end of this paper, several applications based on layout patterns are discussed. All of this work expects to benefit relaxing combinatorial explosion that occurs in the process of solving packing and layout optimization problems, as well as constructing new efficient algorithm for them.

At present, intensive study is underway to practically realize the idea and apply it to engineering fields. Taking engineering layout design as background, we present a human-computer cooperative genetic algorithm (HCCGA). In HCCGA, the artificial individuals supplied by human, together with the individuals generated by HCCGA, form the population of algorithm. And all the individuals are put into algorithm operation (including selection, crossover and mutation, etc) to evolve the population to the next generation. Appropriate numbers of new artificial individuals are also introduced and replace the relevant individuals at an opportune moment during evolution process as well. The procedure of evolutionary computation and interaction will be recycled until the end criterion is satisfied. This algorithm benefits giving free rein to the talents of human and computer and contributes to solving complex engineering problems satisfactorily.

This paper presents a new variation on the DE algorithm, called the cooperative coevolutionary differential evolution (CCDE). CCDE adopts the cooperative coevolutionary architecture, which was proposed by Potter and had been successfully applied to genetic algorithm, to improve significantly the performance of the DE. Such improvement is achieved by partitioning a high-dimensional search space by splitting the solution vectors of DE into smaller vectors, then using multiple cooperating subpopulations (or smaller vectors) to co-evolve subcomponents of a solution. Applying the new DE algorithm to on 11 benchmark functions, we show that CCDE has a marked improvement in performance over the traditional DE and cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA).

33745171092	Human intelligence-diagram-computation-based layout designing method	Engineering practices show that depending on designer's experience and wisdom, referring to prior designing knowledge and utilizing advanced computer technologies have been the acknowledged way to solve the engineering problems. Inspired from this rule and the idea of 'Man-Machine Synergy', a human intelligence, diagram and computation-based integrated layout designing method is proposed. Where human is responsible for the 'artificial solutions', simplified layout diagrams afford 'prior knowledge solutions', and evolutionary algorithm contributes to 'algorithm solutions'. All these solutions are encoded to numerical strings in the same manner, and then make up of the evolutionary population together. At last, a series of evolutionary operations, such as reproduction, crossover and mutation, etc. are done on the population. Therefore, the human intelligence, diagram (prior knowledge) and the computation (computer algorithm) are combined in the gene layer of evolutionary algorithm, where the diagram will be mapped to numerical solutions (such as geometry parameters or mass-center coordinates of each object) by Hough transform technology. Finally, the numerical experiments on two layout designing problems have proved that the method is feasible and effective.

APSO uses a new three-target velocity updating formula, i.e. the best previous position, the global best position and a new target position (called active target). In this study, we distinguish APSO from EPSO (extended PSO)/PSOPC (PSO with passive congregation) by the different methods of getting the active target. Note that here EPSO and PSOPC are the two existing methods for using three-target velocity updating formula, and getting the third (active) target from the obtained positions by the swarm. The proposed APSO gets the active (third) target using complex method, where the active target does not belong to the existing positions. We find that the APSO has the advantages of jumping out of the local optimum and keeping diversity; however, it also has the disadvantages of adding some extra computation expenses. The experimental results show the competitive performance of APSO when compared with PSO, EPSO, and PSOPC. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Thus Pro/E software was integrated with the system. Therefore, designers could reuse the parts through either Web or Pro/E platform. Finally, a part design reuse example of a diesel motor of crawler crane was used to prove the feasibility of the proposed system.

32344432021	Particle swarm optimization based on pyramid model for satellite module layout	To improve the global search ability of particle swarm optimization (PSO), a multi-population PSO based on pyramid model (PPSO) is presented. Then, it is applied to solve the layout optimization problems against the background of an international commercial communication satellite (INTELSAT-III) module. Three improvements are developed, including multi-population search based on pyramid model, adaptive collision avoidance among particles, and mutation of degraded particles. In the numerical examples of the layout design of this simplified satellite module, the performance of PPSO is compared to global version PSO and local version PSO (ring and Neumann PSO). The results show that PPSO has higher computational accuracy, efficiency and success ratio.

34247574219	Emergency design framework: A satellite preliminary scheme design	The emergency design of mechanical products or equipment (such as a satellite) is significant for disaster relief when the natural disasters occur. Most of us are unaware about the little information that is available in literature about emergency designs. Against the background of the preliminary scheme design of satellite payloads, emergency design was studied in the case of natural disasters. We presented some definitions about emergency design. Then, we proposed the basic ideas of how to realize the emergency design. These ideas were inspired by two aspects: 1) the evolutionary algorithms, the agent, the human-computer cooperation, and the collaborative design theory; 2) the emergency behaviors in ant colonies. Following the ideas, first we constructed the human-computer cooperation agents (hereinafter called the HC-Agents) that combine the human intelligence with evolutionary algorithms. These HC-Agents had specific features like the division of labor in the ant colony. Second, we developed the multiagents cooperative design system on the basis of a hybrid P2P (peer-to-peer) model. Therefore, the emergency design system has shown some capabilities, such as anti-interference, adaptation, and rapid response. Â© Higher Education Press 2007.

77954591074	A relative position-coded differential evolution for loop-based station sequencing problem	Loop layout is very common in flexible manufacturing systems. The quality of the layout scheme directly affects productivity of flexible manufacturing systems. The loop-based station sequencing problem (LSSP) that determines the arrangement of the facilities around a closed loop belongs to the category of the combinatorial optimisation problem, which is known to be NP-Hard. Therefore, the heuristic and meta-heuristic methods are generally adopted to solve the LSSP. In order to improve the existing methods, this paper takes into consideration the permutation property of the LSSP, and proposes an integer-coded differential evolution (DE) algorithm, named as relative position-coded DE. Compared with existing real-coded DEs, the proposed algorithm possesses the following favourable characteristics: (1) it does not need mapping from floating point vectors to integer sequence; (2) the coding space of the new algorithm corresponds with the solution space of LSSP; (3) it avoids the illegal chromosomes in the solving process. Experimental results showed that the proposed relative position-coded DE outperforms the existing DEs, GA, PSO, and SA, especially in the case of large-scale LSSP. Â© 2010 Taylor & Francis.

77954749316	Textual chunk retrieval and packing in pattern	Pattern technology of writing is widely used in machine writing systems. In pattern technology, there are two core issues about chunk as writing material in the pattern. One is chunk retrieval, the other is chunk packing. In this study, we focus on the problem of chunk retrieval and packing with given style, topic and content of practical writing. We proposed the concept of chunk, and discussed the method of chunk retrieval in context. Then we studied the approach of chunk packing. Differ from general packing problem, chunk packing is affected by several special factors: stylistic features, writing model, literal semantic and etc. These require the intelligence of human. Thus our chunk packing approach is based on manmachine cooperation genetic algorithm. The man-machine cooperation approach can realize the integration of the human and the machine to finish the writing process. Â© 2010 IEEE.

51749103134	Product design reuse with parts libraries and an engineering semantic web for small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises	The design reuse of products is vital for mass customization. In small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs), employing design reuse is a challenging issue because of the limited level and scale of these enterprises. Previous studies have not considered this issue and have attempted to rebuild a complete novel system. In this study, we propose a design reuse approach based on an engineering semantic web (ESW) and implement a design reuse system. This system does not rebuild the current parts library in SMMEs. In our approach, we construct an ESW and a mapping relation to introduce engineering semantic information into the existing parts library. In addition, we employ ant colony optimization (ACO) for the retrieval of design information. A design reuse prototype system is implemented for solving the problem of design reuse in SMMEs.

55449136408	Human-computer cooperative layout design method and its application	Layout design of spacecraft module belongs to scheme design problem, which has been proved to be NP hard. This problem has not only computing complexity but also engineering complexity, and it is more difficult to meet the challenge of practical application in engineering. Inspired by the ideas of "Man-Machine Synergy" and successful design patterns from the modern engineers, this paper proposed a Human-Algorithm-Knowledge-based layout Design method (HAKD) to deal with such complicated problems. Here, the engineers' successful design patterns mainly include the following aspects: depending on human's experience and wisdom, consulting some prior knowledge (for example, relevant layout diagrams), and utilizing the available computer technologies, etc. HAKD takes the evolutionary algorithm (e.g. genetic algorithm) as the "algorithm" foundation, in which "human" provides artificial layout schemes (artificial solutions), layout diagrams afford "prior knowledge" solutions, and the evolution algorithm produces novel algorithm solutions. All these numerical solutions are expressed by unified encoding strings, which make up of the evolution algorithm population together, and take part in corresponding evolution operations (such as reproduction, crossover and mutation, etc.). So human's intelligence, computer's intelligence (evolution algorithm) and prior knowledge extracted from layout diagrams are fused in the gene level of the evolution algorithm and fully play their own strong suits for the problem solving. In HAKD, the prior knowledge (in this paper, it refers to the geometry characters and position characters of the objects) is recognized and extracted by Hough Transform technology or directly given by commercial CAD software (such as Pro/Engineer) model. A series of experiments on the layout design problem of an international communication satellite module are performed by comparing HAKD with GA, GA+Prior Knowledge and GA+Human. The experiment results show that HAKD outperforms the others. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

62549131184	Optimal layout design of a satellite module using a coevolutionary method with heuristic rules	The layout design of a satellite module belongs to a three-dimensional (3D) packing problem with mutual-conflicting performance constraints. Taking the layout design of a simplified commercial communication satellite as a background, based on the cooperative coevolutionary framework, this paper presents a coevolutionary method with heuristic rules for the optimal layout design of a satellite module. First, a whole satellite module layout problem is decomposed into several sublayout problems according to the multisubphysical structure of a satellite module. Second, a relaxation model is adopted to distribute all objects among subspaces. Third, a coevolutionary genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the detailed layout design within the subspaces. Finally, a heuristic combination-rotation (CR) method is adopted to adjust the constraints to obtain the final whole layout scheme. Compared with the coevolutionary approach and the all-at-once optimization approaches, computational results show that the CR method can improve the computational accuracy of solutions and the proposed heuristic coevolutionary method can produces better solutions within short running times.

63449100159	Detecting particle swarm optimization	Here, we propose a detecting particle swarm optimization (DPSO). In DPSO, we define several detecting particles that are randomly selected from the population. The detecting particles use the newly proposed velocity formula to search the adjacent domains of a settled position in approximate spiral trajectories. In addition, we define the particles that use the canonical velocity updating formula as common particles. In each iteration, the common particles use the canonical velocity updating formula to update their velocities and positions, and then the detecting particles do search in approximate spiral trajectories created by the new velocity updating formula in order to find better solutions. As a whole, the detecting particles and common particles would do the high-performance search. DPSO implements the common particles' swarm search behavior and the detecting particles' individual search behavior, thereby trying to improve PSO's performance on swarm diversity, the ability of quick convergence and jumping out the local optimum. The experimental results from several benchmark functions demonstrate good performance of DPSO. Copyright Â© 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

67651055927	Local scale-based 3D model retrieval for design reuse	3D model retrieval plays an important role in product design reuse. We present a local scale-based model retrieval methodology for 3D mechanical parts library. On the grounds that most of the mechanical parts have visible main planes, we firstly propose a novel approach, i.e., the plane comparison-based pose normalization. This approach was employed complementally with principal component analysis (PCA for short) on the normals of the model's face to perform rotation invariance. After pose normalization, the model is scaled locally along a certain axis so that the size of its local features can be adjusted reasonably. In this way, the feature vectors of the scaled model can represent all the local features. The feature vectors of the deformed model are extracted by the real spherical harmonics. Finally, the feature vectors and the scale factors are used in an experiment for similarity comparison. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed five other methods on the National Design Repository dataset and our own complex mechanical parts dataset.

These kinds of problems belong to the packing problem and NPC problem in math, and scheme design problem and complex system problem in engineering, and the research on them is far from enough. The complex layout problem is composed of two types in terms of practicality engineering, one is the problem that can be abstracted to mathematical model (including the mathematical model for Genetic Algorithm), and the other is the problem that can not (or is difficult to) be abstracted to mathematical model. The main problems existing here are as follows: it is difficult in modeling and solving in math; and there are complexities in practicing in engineering. This paper introduces the authors' researches in the recent two decades on solution strategies, modeling and algorithm which have been adopted in the solution of the layout optimization of spacecraft modules, and discusses the unsolved problems. The man-computer cooperation to make full use of both man and computer is a promising approach to the complex layout scheme design in engineering in terms of practicality.

However, performance of this approach is affected by the problems derived from language variation. In this paper, we investigate a document representation combining words and concepts to integrate the advantages of two types of representations. The approach takes the part of speech as the concept for the word which is error-prone in word sense disambiguation to reduce the disambiguation mistakes. The approach employs three ways to measure the contributions of different representation forms to classification and selects the most productive one as the feature to drop the concepts not suitable for representation while not losing the lexical semantic information. We conduct experiments to compare the performance of different types of representations on Chinese text categorization corpus of Fudan University.

The ACOSS algorithm combines a local search strategy, ant colony optimization (ACO), and a scatter search (SS) in an iterative process. In this process, ACO first searches the solution space and generates activity lists to provide the initial population for the SS algorithm. Then, the SS algorithm builds a reference set from the pheromone trails of the ACO, and improves these to obtain better solutions. Thereafter, the ACO uses the improved solutions to update the pheromone set. Finally in this iteration, the ACO searches the solution set using the new pheromone trails after the SS has terminated. In ACOSS, ACO and the SS share the solution space for efficient exchange of the solution set. The ACOSS algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms using a set of standard problems available in the literature. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

74549169911	Cooperative co-evolutionary scatter search for satellite module layout design	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to tackle a satellite module layout design problem (SMLDP). As a complex engineering layout and combinatorial optimization problem, SMLDP cannot be solved effectively by traditional exact methods. Although evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown some promise of tackling SMLDP in previous work, the solution quality and computational efficiency still pose a challenge. This paper aims to address these two issues. Design/methodology/approach - Scatter search (SS) and a cooperative co-evolutionary architecture are integrated to form a new approach called a cooperative co-evolutionary scatter search (CCSS). The cooperative co-evolutionary architecture is characterized by the decomposition and cooperation for dealing with complex engineering problems. SS is a flexible meta-heuristic method that can effectively solve the combinatorial optimization problems. Designing the elements of SS is context-dependent. Considering the characteristics of SMLDP, our work focuses on two folds: the diversification method, and the reference set update method. The diversification method is built on the method of coordinate transformation and the controlled randomness. The reference set is updated by the static method on the basis of two dissimilarities. Two test problems for circles packing illustrated the capacity of SS. However, when solving SMLDP, SS shows some limitations in the computational time and quality. This study adopts divide-conquer-coordination strategy to decompose SMLDP into several layout sub-problems. Then CCSS is applied to cooperatively solve these sub-problems. The experimental results illustrate the capability of the proposed approach in tackling the complex problem with less computational effort. Findings - Applying CCSS to SMLDP can obtain satisfying solutions in terms of quality and computational efficiency. This contrasts with the limiting experimental results of SMLDP with some approaches (including modified SS). Originality/value - A new CCSS is proposed to provide an effective and efficient way of solving SMLDP. Some elements of SS are improved to address the layout problem. SMLDP is decomposed into several sub-problems that can be solved cooperatively by CCSS after its characteristics are taken into consideration. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

77953081561	A Dual-system variable-grain cooperative coevolutionary algorithm: Satellite-module layout design	The layout design of complex engineering systems (such as satellite-module layout design) is very difficult to solve in polynomial time. This is not only a complex coupled system design problem but also a special combinatorial problem. The fitness function for this problem is characterized as multimodal because of interference constraints among layout components (objects), etc. This characteristic can easily result in premature convergence when solving this problem using evolutionary algorithms. To deal with the above two problems simultaneously, we propose a dual-system framework based on the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (CCEA, e.g., cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm) like multidisciplinary design optimization. The proposed algorithm has the characteristic of solving the complex coupled system problem, increasing the diversity of population, and decreasing the premature convergence. The basis for the proposed algorithm is as follows. The original coupled system P is decomposed into several subsystems according to its physical structure. The system P is duplicated as systems A and B, respectively. The A system is solved on a global level (all-in-one), whereas the solving of B system is realized through the computation of its subsystems in parallel. The individual migration between A and B is implemented through the individual migration between their corresponding subsystems. To reduce the computational complexity produced additionally by the dual-systems A and B, we employ a variable-grain model of design variables. During the process of optimization, the two systems A and B gradually approximate to the original system P, respectively. The above-proposed algorithm is called the dual-system variable-grain cooperative coevolution algorithm (DVGCCEA) or Oboe-CCEA. The numerical experimental results of a simplified satellite-module layout design case show that the proposed algorithm can obtain better robustness and trade-off between computational precision and computational efficiency.

Thus how to rapidly respond to unanticipated environment changes (UEC) is an important issue to be resolved for existing products. This paper discusses the adaptable redesign of existing equipment, which performs adaptation or adding new components in existing equipment, avoids redesigning or remanufacturing new equipment so as to quickly meet expected performance requirements. For a complex equipment with many interrelated parameters, there might exist couplings and even contradictions in the redesign. And it is difficult for engineers to determine how changes in certain parameters affect the system performance. The key issues of the redesign are discussed including function-structure analysis, structure change propagation prediction and contradiction resolving. The design issue is analyzed in an existing TBM responding to unanticipated ground changes. Â© (2010) Trans Tech Publications.

79955054583	Frictional torque characteristic of angular contact ball bearings	Based on the dynamics and thermodynamic analysis of angular contact ball bearings, the theoretical computational formulae of the friction torque of angular contact ball bearings are obtained with the law of energy conservation. The theoretical analysis and the experimental verification for the effects of the structural parameters, operation condition on frictional torque of the angular contact ball bearings are presented. The results show that a big inner groove curvature radius coefficient is in favor of reducing the friction torque under low rotation speed, when the bearings work at high speed, a small inner groove curvature radius coefficient is better. A large outer groove curvature radius coefficient yields low friction torque in low or high speed operation, and a small one should be chosen for medium speed operation. It is unfavorable to reduce the friction torque of the angular contact ball bearings if the cage guiding clearance is oversize or undersize, and there is a reasonable cage guiding clearance to get the lowest friction torque. The square type cage pocket is better for the reduction of friction torque under low speed condition, and the straight cage pocket has advantages under high rotation speed condition.

79955642767	A 5-DOF model for aeroengine spindle dual-rotor system analysis	This paper develops a five degrees of freedom (5-DOF) model for aeroengine spindle dual-rotor system dynamic analysis. In this system, the dual rotors are supported on two angular contact ball bearings and two deep groove ball bearings, one of the latter-mentioned bearings works as the inter-shaft bearing. Driven by respective motors, the dual rotors have different co-rotating speeds. The proposed model mathematically formulates the nonlinear displacements, elastic deflections and contact forces of bearings with consideration of 5-DOF and coupling of dual rotors. The nonlinear equations of motions of dual rotors with 5-DOF are solved using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm. In order to investigate the effect of the introduced 5-DOF and nonlinear dynamic bearing model, we compare the proposed model with two models: the 3-DOF model of this system only considering three translational degrees of freedom (Gupta,1993, rotational freedom is neglected); the 5-DOF model where the deep groove ball bearings are simplified as linear elastic spring (Guskov, 2007). The simulation results verify Gupta's prediction (1993) and show that the rotational freedom of rotors and nonlinear dynamic model of bearings have great effect on the system dynamic simulation. The quantitative results are given as well. Â© 2011 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics. All rights reserved.

79955911089	Dynamic stability analysis of cages in high-speed oil-lubricated angular contact ball bearings	To investigate the cage stability of high-speed oil-lubricated angular contact ball bearings, a dynamic model of cages is developed on the basis of Gupta's and Meeks' work. The model can simulate the cage motion under oil lubrication with all six degrees of freedom. Particularly, the model introduces oil-film damping and hysteresis damping, and deals with the collision contact as imperfect elastic contact. In addition, the effects of inner ring rotational speed, the ratio of pocket clearance to guiding clearance and applied load on the cage stability are investigated by simulating the cage motion with the model. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the design of ball bearing parameters. Â© 2011 Tianjin University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

An opposition-based Cooperative Coevolutionary Differential Evolution algorithm with Gaussian mutation (OCCDEG) is developed here to solve this problem. In the proposed algorithm, the whole population was divided into several subpopulations. Cooperating with each other, these subpopulations evolve together to search the optimal solution. The cooperative coevolution decreases the complexity of problems and improves the convergence rate of the algorithm. The Opposition-Based Learning (OBL), employed for population initialization and evolution, enhances the exploration capability of the algorithm and improves the convergence rate of the algorithm. The Gaussian mutation operator enhances the local search of the algorithm.

84863164259	Human-computer co-operative co-evolutionary method and its application to a satellite module layout design problem	The layout design of a satellite module is a complex mechanical layout problem. Its main difficulties lie in combinatorial explosion of computational complexity, engineering complexity, and applicability in engineering practice. Inspired by the human-computer cooperation ideas, a human-computer co-operative co-evolutionary method for optimising layout design of a satellite module is developed. This method constructs the diversity reference set by using the diversity intelligence solutions (DIs) that are created by using the combinatorial operators of differential evolution (DE) and the blend crossover operator (BLX-a). During the co-evolution process of the presented method, the AIs, the DIs and the algorithm solutions are expressed by unified encoding strings and incorporated together to create new co-operative solutions. An instance of a satellite module layout design is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the co-evolutionary approach and the all-at-once optimisation approaches, computational results show that the proposed method not only can produce better solutions, but also can better balance the conflicting objectives on the trade-off issues.

84863385034	Variable-grain and dual-network mapping parts design reuse for small and medium-sized enterprises	Currently, there are still many problems about the parts reuse for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China. The main problem is that the reconstruction for parts library is an arduous work and the retrieve of the design knowledge is difficult. To solve this problem, a coarse-fine-grained and dual-network mapping design knowledge reuse method for parts design reuse is proposed. On the basis of the current graphic databases and CAD in the SMEs, a fine-grained tree's structure knowledge network for parts is constructed which is called fine-grained knowledge network. The tree's structure is consistent with the structure of the original database. A coarse-grain network's structure knowledge network with outline-style for parts is also constructed which is expressed by OWL. The dual-network mapping design knowledge reuse method for parts design reuse is applied to variant design or adaptive design of SMEs, and it also can be used for future Web-based design reuse for SMEs. The design reuse example of reducer shows that dual-network mapping design reuse method for parts is effective and practicable.

It can change in an unanticipated way, which often leads to inferior performance or not performing intended functions for existing equipment This paper discusses a strategy responding to unanticipated environment changes (UEC): rapid adaptation design of existing equipment (RADEE). The underlying feature of RADEE is to quickly perform local redesign so as to adapt the existing equipment to current external working environment and in turn meet the requirements of expected performance or emergent functions. The equipment subsystems are inter-rated, thus RADEE is a complex engineering system design issue. During the analysis of the relationships among forms, functions and environment, the coping strategies and design principles are given. Then the change design decision is discussed. Finally, the design issue is analyzed in an existing Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) responding to unanticipated ground changes. Â©2012 International Information Institute.

84876550811	Social ant colony-inspired modelling approach for rapid response design	Some unexpected natural or man-made disasters would cause damage to human life and key infrastructural facilities. In this context, we define rapid response design (RRD) as a design methodology for rapidly designing equipment in a changing environment to minimise loss in the disaster. To adapt to the unpredictable requirements, RRD has to incorporate the ability to respond rapidly, be flexible, robust and adaptable. To reach these goals, we present a social ant colony-inspired modelling approach for RRD. This study firstly makes a survey on the social ant colony to find its inherent mechanism used in RRD modelling process. Then, this study focuses on how to make a rapid response design system incorporating the ability to be insensitive to disasters, and to be resilient or reconfigured after breakdown. Finally, we illustrate a rapid response design framework based on multi-agent system that simulates the operation environment of the social ant colony to cope with changing fluctuant conditions. The proposed modelling approach would be expanded to the rapid response processing in the management field. Copyright Â© 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

84880061666	Dual-system cooperative coevolutionary differential evolution algorithm for solving nonseparable function optimization	In recent years, researches on high-dimensional nonseparable function optimization have made progress. Approaches based on Potter's Cooperative Coevolutionary (CC) framework have achieved better results and aroused a great attention. However, the computational results are still unsatisfying for most Benchmark functions. Therefore, this study develops a dual-system (population) cooperative coevolutionary differential evolution (DCCDE) algorithm based on dual-system Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). This algorithm adopts a variable static grouping pattern and a improved Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm combined with simple crossover (SPX) local search strategy and modifies the migration pattern of the sub-individuals (not subpopulations) among the subsystems (subgroups of variables) in the dual-system. The test results of 20 Benchmark functions (including 17 nonseparable functions, dimension D = 1000) show that the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms in computational accuracy.

Because it has extensive engineering applications, packing layout problem is concerned more and more in recent years. Layout pattern refers to the relative position relationship between objects in layout scheme. It is one of the important aspects that deserve to be studied in a deep-going way. Taking the layout scheme design of satellite cabins as background, we study layout patterns of packing layout problem in a circular container. The relevant concepts are defined, such as isomorphic and non-isomorphic layout patterns. And we present relation matrix, pattern matrix and their transformations to represent and recognize various layout patterns. We also propose some construction methods of isomorphic and non-isomorphic patterns. Non-isomorphic degree is introduced to measure the difference between two layout patterns. In this paper, several applications based on layout patterns are discussed. All of this work expects to benefit relaxing combinatorial explosion that occurs when solving packing layout problem and constructing efficient algorithm for layout scheme design.
