84930986816	A multi-time scale reactive power coordinated control strategy based on continuous and discrete VAR sources	Integration of large-scale wind power had become main mode of wind-power delivery in China, however, as the weakness of grid and diversity of VAR sources, operation voltage fluctuation of power systems integrated with large-scale wind power remains to be solved. Therefore, propose a multi-time scale reactive power coordinated control strategy regarding fast continuous and slow discrete VAR sources, design a two-level coordinated voltage control model based on property of various VAR sources. The primary control level deals with operation of discrete VAR sources such as shunt capacitor and reactor based on wind power forecast to mitigate long-term substantial voltage fluctuation of pilot buses at large time scale; while the secondary control level deals with operation of continuous VAR sources such as wind turbines, SVC and SVG to mitigate small frequent voltage fluctuation of pilot buses at short time scale. Voltage fluctuation of pilot buses is effectively mitigated by two-level coordinated control strategy. The calculation on the voltage of China's grid accommodating large-scale and centralized wind power validates that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem of voltage fluctuation of pilot buses.

A technology named division bloom filter (DBF) which is based on bloom filter is proposed. DBF uses an array of independent Hash functions to compute addresses of data objects, and then stores these data objects in bit vector according to their addresses. In this way, it can effectively reduce storage space. Experiments are carried out to show that DBF can not only solve the dynamic update problem of bloom filter within distributed environment but also effectively reduce error rate of bloom filter. Besides, the stability of bloom filter is enhanced by DBF. Finally, data compression technology is adopted to further reduce communication overhead between peers within P2P system.

In order to improve the efficiency of query, we are urged to find a more appropriate index. It makes the search on data objects of multidimensional space more complicated because of the logic structures of the multidimensional objects. This results in that the present spatial index structures are not match with the system of P2P data sharing.

33846896196	Experimental study on the selection of laser line width in fiber interferometer vibration sensing system	The influence of laser line width on the performance of fiber interferometer vibration sensing system (FIVSS) is studied in the present work⋯ Three sets of lasers with different line width (about 10 MHz, 3 KHz-10 KHz and about 50 MHz respectively) are used in the same FIVSS respectively and their output performance is evaluated by comparing and theoretically analyzing the experimental results. The results of the presentation show that the FIVSS with lasers having too narrow or too wide line width can not detect the vibration signal effectively, and the FIVSS with the laser having line width of about 10 MHz can suppress exterior disturbance and detect the vibration signal effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to select laser with proper line width for setting up FIVSS with optimum performance.

33947258312	Diquarks and the semileptonic decay of Λb in the hybrid scheme	In this work we use the heavy-quark-light-diquark picture to study the semileptonic decay Λb→Λc+l+ν̄l in the so-called hybrid scheme. Namely, we apply the heavy quark effective theory (HQET) for larger q2 (corresponding to small recoil), which is the invariant mass square of l+ν̄, whereas the perturbative QCD approach for smaller q2 to calculate the form factors. The turning point where we require the form factors derived in the two approaches to be connected, is chosen near ρcut=1.1. It is noted that the kinematic parameter ρ which is usually adopted in the perturbative QCD approach, is in fact exactly the same as the recoil factor ω=v•v′ used in HQET where v, v′ are the four velocities of Λb and Λc respectively. We find that the final result is not very sensitive to the choice, so that it is relatively reliable. Moreover, we apply a proper numerical program within a small range around ρcut to make the connection sufficiently smooth and we parametrize the form factor by fitting the curve gained in the hybrid scheme. The expression and involved parameters can be compared with the ones gained by fitting the experimental data. In this scheme the end-point singularities do not appear at all. The calculated value is satisfactorily consistent with the data which is recently measured by the DELPHI collaboration within 2 standard deviations. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The development of practical source of THz radiation is crucial to the realization of these applications. Using optical parametric oscillator with intersecting pump results in compact, low threshold THz radiation source. Lithium niobate is one of the most suitable materials for generating THz waves efficiently because of its large nonlinear coefficient and its transparency over a wide wavelength range. In this communication we theoretically analyze generation of tunable terahertz (THz) radiation which is based on optical parametric process, in particular using a non-collinear quasi-phase matched geometry in the nonlinear crystal periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN), and where wide and continuous tuning is obtained by changing the poled period and the angle between the resonated idler wave and the pump wave. Also the THz wave should fulfill the energy and momentum conservation laws. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the wavelength and the frequency of THz wave are analyzed. The optimal THz wave parametric oscillator for efficient coupling output power can be designed according to our theoretical results.

78149287320	Nonlinear feed forward pitch controller for wind turbine based on rotor's aerodynamic characteristic	Large-scale variable pitch wind turbine generator (WTG) system usually uses the PID controller to maintain the output power unchanged above the rated wind speed. Because WTG has the characteristic of inertia and delay and the wind speed varies randomly, the simple feedback control method such as PID controller can hardly achieve satisfactory performance. This paper firstly analyzes the shortcomings of PID controller, and then a new pitch control method combined with nonlinear feed forward controller and PID controller is proposed. At high wind speed range, there is nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and wind speed due to the aerodynamic characteristic of the rotor. This paper obtains this relationship with numerical calculation and least square polynomial fit method. Then the nonlinear model is used to design the feed forward controller. Its input is wind speed and the output is the increasing feed forward reference pitch angle. The feed forward controller has achieved the dynamic feed forward compensation and improved the rapidness of control system. With the simulation of a 300kW wind turbine generator at different wind speed, the new pitch control strategy can effectively reduce system's overshoot and regulation time, and has a satisfactory control performance. © 2010 IEEE.

78149351076	Fuzzy feed forward system based on T-S model applied for constant power control in wind power system	Constant power control technology is one of the key technologies in wind power control. PI control is the most widely used technology in constant power control system. Hysteresis of PI control will cause a large overshoot of the output power that will make interference to the power grid. Feedforward control system can reduce the system lag. The fuzzy controller based on T-S model can overcome the influence caused by non-linear and uncertain mathematical model of the system. The fuzzy controller makes the feedforward controller easy to realize. Introducing neural network training method into Fuzzy control will greatly simplify the design of fuzzy controller. Based on Neural Adaptive - Fuzzy technology, a feed forward system is proposed in this paper, which is able to timely adjust pitch angle according to changes of wind speed. At last, the control strategy is simulated by MATLAB. The simulation results show that the method greatly improves the performance of system dynamic response, thus ensuring a constant power output. © 2010 IEEE.

78650351327	A new climatic index for mapping world vegetation distribution	The proposed climatic index, named C value, is the coefficient of the third correlative equation that characterizes the dryness (or wetness) of climate, and the third correlative equation deals with heat and water balance related to evaporation. In this article, C value, mean temperature, and summer temperature are combined to predict the distribution of vegetation zones in world. The overall impression from examining the resulting vegetation map is that the location and distribution of vegetation zones in the world are predicted fairly well. Comparison between the predicted vegetation map and the Holdridge Life Zones map are made based on Kappa statistics, which indicates very significant agreement for the Ice/polar desert and Desert. Agreement is also significant for the categories of tundra, boreal forest, temperate mixed and deciduous forest, temperate steppe, subtropical mixed and deciduous forest, subtropical xerophytic woods/shrubs, tropical rain forest, tropical seasonal forest, tropical savanna, and tropical thorn woods/shrubs, even though much larger area of tundra and tropical thorn woods/shrubs were predicted compared to those on the Holdridge life zones map. The results show that C value has a strong correlation with vegetation distribution. As a climatic index, C value can be used for bioclimatic mapping at global scale. © 2010 SPIE.

78650215022	New variable pitch control strategy combining nonlinear feed forward and fuzzy PID control for wind turbine-generator sets	Aiming at the strong non-linear and time-delay characteristics of wind turbine-generator set, a new variable pitch control strategy combining nonlinear feed forward and fuzzy PID control is being proposed, so as to overcome the deficiency of conventional PID controller that can't achieve satisfactory performance above rated speed. According to aerodynamic characteristics of its blade, the nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and wind speed was obtained by way of numerical calculation and least square polynomial fitting method, based on which a nonlinear feed forward controller was designed. Simulation results on a 300 kW variable pitch wind turbine-generator set show that with the new pitch control strategy, the system's overshoot can be effectively reduced at different wind speed ranges above the rated speed, while the regulation time shortened and satisfactory control effect achieved.

78651082009	Influence and compensation of target motion on monopulse estimation in PD radar	Pulse Doppler (PD) radar system with monopulse estimation can effectively acquire the location information of weak target, since it combines the advantages of coherent integration and monopulse technique. However, as it takes some time to realize the coherent integration, target motion will result in the decline of integration efficiency, thus affects the angle measurement precision. This paper investigates the principle of monopulse estimation in PD radar and the influence of target motion on angle measurement. A modified expression for angle measured value is presented when target has tangential motion, which can be interpreted as the midpoint angle of target motion track. Moreover, the target radial motion can be compensated by envelope interpolation method in time domain with the prior information of velocity, or by Keystone transform method in frequency domain without velocity information. Finally, the availability of the modification and compensation is verified by simulation. © 2010 IEEE.

Firstly, this method constructs the GTD-based impulse response from the moving target in the state space equation, and then arranges the impulse response of different frequency at different time into a Hankel matrix. Next, the range and the range rate are estimated by using the Hankel matrix singular value decomposition (SVD), which effectively solves the range aliasing problem when the ranges of different scattering centers are overlapped. It occurs in the 1D state space when the range is estimated only. At last, the type parameter and intensity of the scattering center are solved out by this method. The effectiveness of the method is verified by comparing the result of processing the echo data from the rotating conical target with the CRB on parameters estimation. © 2010 IEEE.

79952061818	Multiple PID switching variable pitch control strategy based on divided scope of rotor aerodynamic characteristic	Large-scale variable pitch wind turbine usually uses PID controller to maintain the output power unchanged above the rated wind speed. But with rotor's serious nonlinear aerodynamic characteristic, conventional single PID controller can hardly achieve idea control performance. With a deep analysis of rotor's aerodynamic characteristic, the numerical calculation and least square polynomial fit method were used to construct the nonlinear model between the pitch angle and wind speed. Then optimal selection method was used to linearize the model to several partitions according to wind speed. In each partition, one PID controller was designed. When wind speed changed, the outputs of multiple PID controllers switched according to the management strategy. The new control strategy takes rotor's dynamic characteristic into consideration and has the merits of simplicity and easy implement. Simulation of 300 kW wind turbine generator (WTG) proves that the new control strategy has good control performance. © 2010 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

In order to take in-depth insight into the bio-fluid mechanics and the high lift mechanisms of butterfly hovering fly, it is necessary to design and manufacture an electromechanical model of flapping butterfly to simulate the flapping modes of the butterfly. A new designed electromechanical model of flapping butterfly which had the wings and the body just like the real butterfly was introduced. The electromechanical model can fix positions and simulate different flapping modes of the butterfly, including the wings' flapping and body's rotation and up-down-oscillating movement. So it is useable for the experiments of flow visualization and particle image velocimetry(PIV).

79959743164	A new MPPT strategy based on residual error gray wind speed prediction	The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategy has two control methods which are power control and speed control, respectively. Both of them have not used the wind speed information because the wind speed measured is usually inaccurate. The efficiency of MPPT searching process is relatively low. A gray predictive theory was introduced in this paper. The previous wind speed information was used to predict the wind speed of next time. The residual error theory was used to improve the predictive accuracy. The predictive speed obtained by gray method was used to calculate the initial WTG rotor speed of the MPPT searching process. Then rotor speed disturbance was added to the initial speed and finally to complete the MPPT process. Simulating results show that the gray wind speed prediction method has a satisfactory predictive accuracy and can effectively reduce the MPPT searching area and search time. The effectiveness of the WTG is also improved.

79960097488	Automatic classification of radar targets with micro-motions using entropy segmentation and time-frequency features	Micro-Doppler (mD) signatures have great potential in the radar micro-dynamic target classification. An automatic classification method for radar targets with micro-motions is proposed based on the idea of entropy and feature extraction from the spectrogram. In this method, the measurement of entropy is firstly conducted over the time-frequency distribution associated with the minimum filtering operation, the threshold discrimination and the region focusing to obtain the region of interest corresponding to mD signatures in the original spectrogram. It helps acquire the valid region in the time-frequency domain and reduce the computational burden in the following processing. Next, invariant moments and geometric characteristics of time-frequency distribution of mD signatures are extracted from the segmented spectrogram to construct mD feature vectors. A support vector machine (SVM) with decision-tree architecture is then used for multiclass micro-dynamic target classification from radar echoes. Finally, some experimental tests with simulated mD data are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and evaluate the performance under different conditions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), training set and feature vector. In addition, issues related to the improvement of classification performance are also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

79959786297	Petri net model and reliability evaluation for wind turbine hydraulic variable pitch systems	Based on an analysis of the working principles of the hydraulic variable pitch system of a wind turbine, a novel Petri net model and reliability evaluation method are proposed. First, Petri net theory is adopted to build a model for each discrete state of the operation of the hydraulic pitch system of the wind turbine and at the same time a fault Petri net model is established. Then through qualitative analysis and quantitative calculations based on the fault Petri net, the system reliability indexes are obtained. During the qualitative analysis process, in order to more conveniently find the minimal cut sets of the fault Petri net, a Visual C++ 6.0-based algorithm is compiled and the minimal cut sets are tested correctly with another method. During the quantitative calculation process, the fault probability has been obtained from the equations according to the fault probability of libraries and transitions between different states. Not only does the proposed Petri net describe the structure, function and operation of the hydraulic pitch system with a graphic language, but the fault Petri net model can also clearly express the logical relations among faults. The novel Petri net model offers simple calculations and the prospect of broad applicability and the new reliability evaluation method provides an important reference for the performance evaluation of these systems. © 2011 by the authors.

84555170280	A review of wind power forecasting models	Rapid growth in wind power, as well as increase on wind generation, requires serious research in various fields. Because wind power is weather dependent, it is variable and intermittent over various time-scales. Thus accurate forecasting of wind power is recognized as a major contribution for reliable large-scale wind power integration. Wind power forecasting methods can be used to plan unit commitment, scheduling and dispatch by system operators, and maximize profit by electricity traders. In addition, a number of wind power models have been developed internationally, such as WPMS, WPPT, Prediktor, ARMINES, Previento, WPFS Ver1.0 etc. This paper provides a review on comparative analysis on the foremost forecasting models, associated with wind speed and power, based on physical methods, statistical methods, hybrid methods over different time-scales. Furthermore, this paper gives emphasis on the accuracy of these models and the source of major errors, thus problems and challenges associated with wind power prediction are presented. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The technique is used to construct the normal behavior model of the electrical generator temperature. A new and improved memory matrix construction method is adopted to achieve better coverage of the generator's normal operational space. Generator incipient failure is indicated when the residuals between model estimates and the measured generator temperature become significant. Moving window averaging is used to detect statistically significant changes of the residual mean value and standard deviation in an effective manner; when these parameters exceed predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged.

Temperature trend analysis is an effective method to monitor the wind turbine gearbox condition. In this paper, Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) and the back-propagation (BP) neural network were combined together to construct normal behavior model for gearbox temperature that was used to estimate the value of temperature. With a proper selection of training sample, the IPSO-BP model can cover the normal working space of the gearbox. When the gearbox works abnormally, its dynamic characteristic deviates from the normal work space and the residuals between IPSO-BP model estimates and the measurement temperature will become significant. The statistic method of moving window is used to calculate the statistical distribution characteristics of the residual sequence. When the mean or standard deviation of residuals exceeds a predefined threshold, alarm will be triggered, suggesting that operator should check the gearbox condition.

They are significantly observed on biological surfaces that control wettability and adhesion by means of micro-/nanostructures, and have aroused interest in foundational and biomimetic research. Here, we report a novel taper-ratchet array on ryegrass leaf. It integrates a gradient of retention at solid-liquid interfaces in contrasting directions to reversibly generate the release or the pinning of solid-liquid contact lines, and accordingly, achieves effective directional water shedding-off properties. By mimicking taper-ratchets from ryegrass leaf, the polymer surfaces are fabricated successfully. They display a robust property of directional water shedding-off. When external vibrations are executed on polymer surfaces, the drops achieve a unidirectional self-shedding along the oriented direction of tips of taper-ratchets, because asymmetric retention forces are formed in the contrasting oriented directions.

84882799546	Data mining with improved Apriori algorithm on wind generator alarm data	Alarm system is an important subsystem of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system in wind turbines. Because of the bad operating environment and condition switching frequently, this system has the problems of alarm too frequently and too large amount of alarm data which greatly reduce the effectiveness of the alarm system. Remove the excessive redundant alarm and refine the valid information are significant to early find wind turbines abnormal operation, to research the causal connection between different faults and to reduce the operators' workload. Data mining is an effective way to solve this problem. This paper used association rules on improved Apriori algorithm to analysis the alarm information which happened before and after blade angle asymmetry fault. Combined with the running mechanism of variable-pitch systems, we find the implied causal relationships between faults, then filter out minor redundant information, refine effective leading fault alarms and at last greatly reduce the number of alarm, improve the operators' work efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.

84882803612	Short-term wind speed prediction based on support vector machine of fuzzy information granulation	Wind power prediction is an effective way to decrease the effects for the large-scale grid-connected wind power generation. Improving accuracy of short-term wind prediction is the key to wind power prediction. There is often a lot of redundant information in the observed values of wind speed to result in large computation and affect the predictive validity. In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) method was proposed based on information granulating. Firstly, original data was dealt with fuzzy information granulation to form information granulation. Secondly, adopting SVM is widely used in regression prediction to predict the changes of short-term average wind speed in trends and in space. At last, the actual data was compared with the predicted data to verify results. The verification experiments show that granulated data can not only reflect the characteristics of wind but also reduce redundant information. The predicted result was changing in the space of average wind speed. So, this method can predict the short-term wind speed space. © 2013 IEEE.

84899071846	Joint target tracking and classification based on aerodynamic model and RCS observation	An effective joint target tracking and classification technology, which uses the radio frequency modulation (FM) signals transmitted by the commercial broadcast stations on ground, based on the aerodynamic model and RCS observation is proposed for the ground-based passive warning radars for monitoring the low altitude penetration incoming targets. The aerodynamic model is used to describe the translation and rotation of target, and the specific parameters of a particular type of aircraft are transferred to the tracker to realize the aerodynamic model-based tracking; at the same time, the radar cross section (RCS) is included in the observation to provide the main classification featuers, and the outputs of the tracker are used to predict the RCS value. Therefore, tracking and classification are coupled tightly to give full play to the advantage of joint tracking and classification, effectively improving the tracking performance and classification probability. In the implementation of this technology, the electromagnetic simulation software FEKO is applied to obtain the target's real-time RCS observation; this joint tracking and classification is realized by particle filtering. A simulation platform for the FM signal-based target tracking and classification by passive radar is built. The simulation results show that the interacting multiple model regularized particle filter works better than the interacting multiple model particle filter in tracking accuracy and classification probability.

84902378487	Reconstruction and application of 3D pig body model based on point cloud data	The traditional manual measurement to get the animal growth parameters is high workload, low precision, stress and other issues. For these problems, 120-day-old Landrace samples were chosen for the study, and then got the point cloud data of the pig through the three-dimensional laser scanner, based on the triangulation principle to calculate three-dimensional coordinates of the target point. By Polygon Editing Tool Vel. 2.40 software, the point cloud data were preprocessed, and then the three-dimensional surface model of pig body was reconstructed based on triangulated irregular network. Then the parameters were extracted for pig body length, body width, hip width, height, hip height, chest measurement, body surface area, volume and so on. The results indicated that the 272021 pig point data were acquired by three-dimensional laser scanner, and pig three-dimensional surface was reconstructed by 544042 polygons. By error test method, the detection values by the three-dimensional model and measured values of the body parameter were compared. The regression analysis showed that there was high detection precision in body length, width, hip width, height, hip height, chest and other body parameters. The maximum relative error was only 0.42%, and the average relative error was 0.17%. Using the point cloud data of pig and three-dimensional surface of pig to estimation the shape parameters has high precision and can reduce the workload and give no stress in pigs. It can provide high-precision body size data for estimation model of pig body weight, and technical reference for the other parameters of animal body.

10844243967	Non-spectator contributions to lifetime of Λb	In this work, we study the contributions of non-spectator effects to the lifetimes of Ab and B-mesons comparatively. Based on the well-established theoretical framework about the effective weak Lagrangian, we derive the formulation of the non-spectator effects at the quark level. Especially, for At we have considered two pictures: the three-valence-quark picture and the quark-diquark picture. In the two pictures, the interference contributions to the total width are different, in this work, we investigate the interference effects in detail. As a preliminary estimate on the lifetimes, we evaluate the hadronic matrix elements appearing in the final formulas of the lifetimes by means of a simple phenomenological model for both pictures. Our results show that the contributions of the non-spectator effects can reduce the ratio of lifetime of A
