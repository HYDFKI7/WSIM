33846218160	A novel 3-D dynamic cellular automata model for photoresist-etching process simulation	A novel three-dimensional (3-D) dynamic cellular automata (CA) model is presented for a photoresist-etching process simulation (photoresist-dissolution simulation and development simulation). In the 3-D dynamic CA model, the Moore neighborhood is adopted, and the boundary cells are only processed by using a boundary cell array, a corresponding linked list of pointers to the boundary cells, and a state flag to indicate the relations between the cells and the etching boundary. A time-compensation method is also introduced to speed up the photoresist-etching simulation. Therefore, the simulation speed is greatly increased compared with that of the static 3-D CA model, and the preferential etch in different directions reported in cell-removal models is significantly reduced. The 3-D dynamic CA model was successfully tested using some well-known etch-rate distribution test functions and has been shown to be stable, accurate, and fast. Exposure simulation, post-exposure bake simulation, and photoresist-etching simulation have been successfully integrated together to further study the effectiveness of the 3-D dynamic CA model. Simulation results show an agreement with available experimental results. © 2007 IEEE.

79951575955	Constructing the Bayesian network structure from dependencies implied in multiple relational schemas	Relational models are the most common representation of structured data, and acyclic database theory is important in relational databases. In this paper, we propose the method for constructing the Bayesian network structure from dependencies implied in multiple relational schemas. Based on the acyclic database theory and its relationships with probabilistic networks, we are to construct the Bayesian network structure starting from implied independence information instead of mining database instances. We first give the method to find the maximum harmoniousness subset for the multi-valued dependencies on an acyclic schema, and thus the most information of conditional independencies can be retained. Further, aiming at multi-relational environments, we discuss the properties of join graphs of multiple 3NF database schemas, and thus the dependencies between separate relational schemas can be obtained. In addition, on the given cyclic join dependency, the transformation from cyclic to acyclic database schemas is proposed by virtue of finding a minimal acyclic augmentation. An applied example shows that our proposed methods are feasible. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79951636673	Naïve bayes software defect prediction model	Although the value of using static code attributes to learn defect predictor has been widely debated, there is no doubt that software defect predictions can effectively improve software quality and testing efficiency. Many data mining methods have already been introduced into defect predictions. We noted there have several versions of defect predictor based on Naïve Bayes theory, and analyzed their difference estimation method and algorithm complexity. We found the best one which is Multi-variants Gauss Naïve Bayes (MvGNB) by performing prediction performance evaluation, and we compared this model with decision tree learner J48.

79951638312	On local computations of influence diagrams	Influence diagrams (IDs) are compact and intuitive models for representation and analysis of decision problems under uncertainty. Influence diagrams have always been imposed on no-forgetting and regularity constraints which guarantee that global optimal strategy can be solved successively by local computations on each decision nodes according to a solution ordering. However, it is difficult to solve the global optimal strategy influence diagrams relaxing these two fundamental assumptions, known as limited memory influence diagrams (LIMIDs), because optimal strategy may be found only if all possible strategies have been evaluated. And influence diagrams may not imply any solution ordering. This paper tries to achieve a lower complexity of computations by capturing the graphical characterizations of local computations in Influence diagrams. The definition of the solution ordering is extended from among decision variables to among the sets of decision variables, and extremal sets are presented. Moreover, the global optimal strategy can be found locally on extremal sets. Thus, influence diagrams may be solved successively by local computations on minimal extremal sets even if influence diagrams do not imply any exact solution order among decision variables. And an improvement for solving algorithms would be achieved. ©2010 IEEE.

84877711210	Effectiveness of an optimized benzalkonium chloride gel as vaginal contraceptive: A randomized controlled trial among Chinese women	Background: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of a newly developed benzalkonium chloride (BZK) contraceptive gel which was compared to nonoxynol-9 (N-9) gel. Study Design: A Phase II, multicenter, randomized, controlled study at three Chinese centers was conducted to compare 120 women who used BZK gel with 120 women who used N-9 gel for 6 months. Contraceptive efficacy was assessed by pregnancy rate, and safety was evaluated by adverse events report, gynecologic examination, Papanicolaou smears, leukorrhea test, and blood and urine tests. The acceptability was assessed through follow-up visit forms and a questionnaire at the 6-month visit. Results: Net cumulative rates in the BZK group at 6 months were as follows: follow-up 100%, terminations 5.1%, pregnancy 1.7%, medical reasons 0% and fear of failure 3.4%. At 6 months, the rates in the N-9 group were as follows: follow-up 99.2%, terminations 9.4%, pregnancy 0.9%, medical reasons 2.5%, fear of failure 3.4% and other personal reasons 2.6%. No significant difference in pregnancy rate and termination rate between the two groups was found (p>.05). Seven cases in the BZK group (5.8%) complained about leukorrhagia and vaginal irritation symptoms (itching and burning) at 6 months, while 16 cases in the N-9 group (13.3%) had similar complaints (p<.05). This significant difference continued to exist until the 6-month visit. The general satisfaction rate for BZK gel use (72.8%) is significantly higher than that for N-9 gel (42.5%). Conclusion: The optimized BZK gel is comparable to N-9 gel in terms of contraceptive efficacy and safety, and may be more acceptable to Chinese users. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84897010564	Identification of human tissue kallikrein 6 as a potential marker of laryngeal cancer based on the relevant secretory/releasing protein database	Objective. This study was aimed to create a large-scale laryngeal cancer relevant secretory/releasing protein database and further discover candidate biomarkers. Methods. Primary tissue cultures were established using tumor tissues and matched normal mucosal tissues collected from four laryngeal cancer patients. Serum-free conditioned medium (CM) samples were collected. These samples were then sequentially processed by SDS-PAGE separation, trypsin digestion, and LC-MS/MS analysis. The candidates in the database were validated by ELISA using plasma samples from laryngeal cancer patients, benign patients, and healthy individuals. Results. Combining MS data from the tumor tissues and normal tissues, 982 proteins were identified in total; extracellular proteins and cell surface proteins accounted for 15.0% and 4.3%, respectively. According to stringent criteria, 49 proteins were selected as candidates worthy of further validation. Of these, human tissue kallikrein 6 (KLK6) was verified. The level of KLK6 was significantly increased in the plasma samples from the cancer cohort compared to the benign and healthy cohorts and moreover showed a slight decrease in the postoperative plasma samples in comparison to the preoperative plasma samples. Conclusions. This laryngeal cancer-derived protein database provides a promising repository of candidate blood biomarkers for laryngeal cancer. The diagnostic potential of KLK6 deserves further investigation. © 2014 Ying Zhang et al.

69749104989	Doxycycline inhibits corneal angiogenesis after keratoplasty	BACKROUND: Corneal hemangiogenesis occurs in 40%-60% patients after keratoplasty. Blood vessel is one of the high risk factors for corneal immunological rejection. To inhibit corneal hemangiogenesis would prolong the survival time of the grafts and promote the successful rate of the keratoplasty. OBJECTIVE: To explore the inhibitive effects of doxycycline on corneal angiogenesis after keratoplasty. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A randomized controlled animal experiment was performed at the State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology (No.2006DA105054), Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University from March to August 2007. MATERIALS: A total of 48 healthy clean Sprague Dawley rats served as recipients (right eye) and 24 Wistar rats as donors (both eyes). CD31-PEfluorescent antibody was obtained from Sigma, USA. Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was brought from RapidBio, USA. METHODS: Corneal allogenic transplantation models were established in rats. Recipients were equally and randomly divided into 2 groups: saline control group and doxycycline group. Twenty minutes prior to surgery, mydriasis was performed using 1% atropine, with a diameter of 2.75 mm of implant and 2.5 mm of implant bed. In the saline control group, conjunctiva of the right eye received saline, three times a day, following surgery. In the doxycycline group, conjunctiva of the right eye received 1% doxycycline, three times a day, till 30 days following surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following parameters were measured: corneal angiogenesis using immunofluorescence, expression of VEGF protein by using ELISA. RESULTS: Compared with the survival time of saline control group [(9.67±2.73) days], the mean survival time of doxycycline group [(20.67±3.01) days] was significantly prolonged (P < 0.01). The mean percentages of neovascularized corneal area in the saline control group were (4.00±1.00)%, (14.33±4.04)%, (31.33±3.51)% at 3, 7 and 14 days after keratoplasty, respectively. The mean percentages of neovascularized corneal area in the doxycycline group were (1.67±1.15)%, (4.67±1.53)%, (18.33±1.53)% at the same time point respectively. Compared with the saline control group, the mean percentages of neovascularized corneal area of the doxycycline group was significantly reduced at 7 and 14 days after keratoplasty (P < 0.05). The expression of VEGF in the saline control group was (541.00±75.44) pg/mg, (960.00±90.14) pg/mg, (976.00±130.41) pg/mg at 3, 7 and 14 days after keratoplasty, respectively, while expression of VEGF in the doxycycline group was (115.33±9.29) pg/mg, (239.00±41.62) pg/mg, (361.00±65.20) pg/mg, respectively. The difference of VEGF expression at all time points between the two groups was significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Doxycycline has a significant effect in inhibiting corneal angiogenesis and prolonging survival time of implants after keratoplasty.

77955139208	Lymphatic vessels correlate closely with inflammation index in alkali burned cornea	Purpose: To study the relationship between corneal lymphangiogenesis and inflammation in alkali burned corneas. Methods: Rat corneal lymphatic and blood vessels were labeled and distinguished by whole mount immunofluorescence and 5'-nase-alkaline phosphatase (5'-NA-ALP) double enzyme-histochemistry. Then, lymphatic vessel areas (LVA) and lymphatic vessel counting (LVC) were examined. Corneal inflammation was evaluated by inflammation index (IF) grading, histopathology, electron microscope, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration. The relationship between LVC, LVA, IF, and PMN was examined, respectively. In addition, corneal lymphatic vessels of eleven human alkali burned corneas were examined by lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor (LYVE-1) immunohistochemistry. Results: Corneal lymphangiogenesis occurred on Day 3, reached the peak at the end of two weeks, and disappeared five weeks after alkaline burns. Both LVA and LVC were strongly and positively correlated with IF after corneal alkaline burns. However, the relationship between LVC and PMN, between LVA and PMN were significant but converse. Among eleven human alkali burned corneas, corneal lymphangiogenesis was present in three corneas. Conclusions: Corneal lymphagiogenesis develops after alkaline burns and correlates closely with corneal inflammation. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

77956802542	An accurate detection scheme for selfish nodes in wireless Ad Hoc networks	Existing detection schemes for selfish nodes are inefficient since they can not distinguish selfish nodes from faulty nodes accurately and the false detection rates of these schemes are high. A novel detection scheme for selfish nodes named accurate selfish node detection (ASD) is proposed. The scheme uses SINR model of wireless transceivers, and is based on the character that ad hoc networks are usually densely deployed. Nodes with higher SINR are selected as agents to monitor the relay nodes so that selfish nodes can be detected precisely and can be distinguished from faulty nodes accurately. Based on the facts that selfish nodes send their own packets but deny to relay packets from its neighboring nodes and that faulty nodes never transmit their own packets the ASD is able to distinguish selfish nodes from faulty nodes. There are two types of selfish nodes, some selfish nodes deny to forward data packets, while others deny to reply acknowledgement packets to its neighboring nodes. The ASD can distinguish these two types of selfish nodes precisely. Simulation results and comparisons with the existing detection schemes show that the average false detection rate is reduced by 31% and the average accuracy of detection is raised by 12%.

77956854299	Multiple routes planning for air vehicles based on niche particle swarm optimization	Air vehicle routes planning can be seen as a multiple-peak function optimization problem. The existing genetic algorithm for this problem is complicated. We present a new and more simple algorithm for multiple routes planning of air vehicles which is based on niche particle swarm optimization. In this algorithm, specific particle swarm coding representation and suitable fitness function was used. It can process each kind of the mission constraints. By introducing the Restricted Competition Selection (RCS) niche technique, the individuals of the population form a number of sub-populations. In the evolutionary process, all routes evolve only in their own sub-population. At the end of the evolution, each sub-population provides an optimal route, and thus the algorithm generates multiple routes for the vehicle. The simulation results demonstrated the feasibility of the algorithm.

Attention is paid to the fundamental and subharmonic resonances, since the excitation frequency is close to the first two natural frequencies of the system. The incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method was used to evaluate the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the axially moving beam. The stability and bifurcations of the periodic solutions for given parameters were determined by the multivariable Floquet theory using Hsu's method. The solutions obtained from the IHB method agreed very well with those obtained from numerical integration. Furthermore, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effects of the three-to-one internal resonance on the response of the system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We take a free volume to represent a 'vacancy-ion complex' as a function of grain boundary specific resistivity, and develop a new characterisation model for grain boundary noise. This model reveals the internal relation between the boundary scattering section and electromigration noise. Comparing the simulation result with our experimental result, we find the source as well as the form of noise change in the electromigration process. In order to describe the noise enhancement at grain boundary quantitatively, we propose a new parameter-grain boundary noise enhancement factor, which reflects that the grain boundary noise can characterise the electromigration damage sensitively. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

78649870761	Expression of caveolin-1 protein in ovarian carcinoma and its prognostic value	Objective: To explore the caveolin-1 (CAV1) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression in ovarian carcinoma tissues, and to evaluate their correlation with the clinical pathological features and the prognosis of the patients. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed to examine the expression of CAV-1 and ERα in ovarian carcinoma, borderline ovarian tumor, benign ovarian tumor, and normal ovarian tissues. The correlation between CAV1 expression and clinico-pathclogical parameters was analyzed. Results: The expression of CAV1 was significantly down-regulated in ovarian carcinoma (P = 0.001). The expression level of CAV1 had significant correlation with the histological grade, FIGO surgical stage, pathology types, ascitic cytology, omentum majus metastasis, and lymph node metastasis in ovarian carcinoma (P < 0.05). However, the expression of CAV1 was not correlated with ERα expression (P > 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that CAV1-negative patients had poor prognosis (P < 0.001). A multivariate analysis based on the COX proportional hazard model demonstrated that histological grade and omentum majus metastasis were the independent prognostic factors of ovarian carcinoma (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The absence of CAV1 expression was closely associated with survival rate of the patients. The ovarian cancer patients with negative CAV1 expression might have poor prognosis.

78649888128	The relationship between corneal lymphangiogenesis and inflammation index after corneal alkali injury	Objective To discuss the relationship between corneal lymphangiogenesis and inflammation index ( IF ) in alkali burned comeas. Methods Experimental research. Rat corneal hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were examined by 5'-nase-alkaline phosphatase (5'-NA-ALP) double enzyme-histochemistry and whole mount immunofluorescence at 1 day, 3 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7,8 weeks after alkaline bums, and the blood vessel counting (BVC) and the lymphatic vessel counting ( LVC) were recorded. The state of corneal inflammation was observed under the slit lamp and evaluated by inflammation index (IF) grading at the same time. Then, the association of LVC with IF was examined. In addition, eleven human alkali burned corneas were obtained from 11 patients undergoing corneal transplantation in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 2005 to June 2008. Corneal lymphangiogenesis was examined by lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor ( LYVE-1 ) immunohistochemistry. The significance of the differences in IF, inflammatory cells counting, bum history, and age between two groups was analyzed by using paired student's i-test. Results New lymphatic vessels were present in rat alkali burned comeas. Corneal lymphangiogenesis developed 3 days after alkaline bums, reached the top 2 weeks after the injury, then decreased gradually, and disappeared at the end of the 5th week. Corneal lymphatics occurred behind corneal inflammation, but disappeared before corneal inflammation and hemangiogenesis. LVC was strongly and positively correlated with IF( r = 0. 572,P < 0. 01 ) after corneal alkaline bums. Among eleven human alkali burned corneas, corneal lymphatic vessels were present in 3 corneas. Compared with the other 8 cases without corneal lymphangiogenesis, the scores of IF was significantly higher ( t = 3. 28, P < 0. 05 ) , the inflammatory cells counting dramatically increased(t=2. 42,P <0. 05) , but the age decreased significantly ( t =2. 62,P <0. 05). However, the difference in bum history between two groups was not significant(t = 1.28, P > 0. 05 ) . Conclusion Corneal lymphagiogenesis develops after alkaline-bums and correlates closely with inflammation index.

A scheme with the help of the first three cumulants is devised to check a transport process to follow the counter-flows model, the tunnel model or neither of them. Time series generated by Monte Carlo techniques is adopted to validate the abstraction procedure, and the result is reasonable. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

78650435157	Discriminant analysis for classification of colonic tissue autofluorescence spectra	This study evaluates the potential of a discriminant analysis to classify colonic mucosa from autofluorescence spectral characteristics. With 337 nm excitation, the autofluorescence spectra of colonic tissues were measured using a FLS920 spectrofluorimeter. Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with Fisher's discriminant analysis was performed for tissue classification. As a result, the sensitivity and specificity of the discriminant analysis is 92.3% and 90.5%, respectively. The results suggest the relative concentrations of collagen and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are the potential diagnostic biomarkers for colonic tissue classification using autofluorescence spectroscopy, and the discriminant analysis based on PCA is useful to differentiate adenocarcinoma from normal tissue. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

78650700063	Role of individual subunits of the Neurospora crassa CSN complex in regulation of eneddylation and stability of cullin proteins	The Cop9 signalosome (CSN) is an evolutionarily conserved multifunctional complex that controls ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in eukaryotes. We found seven CSN subunits in Neurospora crassa in a previous study, but only one subunit, CSN-2, was functionally characterized. In this study, we created knockout mutants for the remaining individual CSN subunits in N. crassa. By phenotypic observation, we found that loss of CSN-1, CSN-2, CSN-4, CSN-5, CSN-6, or CSN-7 resulted in severe defects in growth, conidiation, and circadian rhythm; the defect severity was gene-dependent. Unexpectedly, CSN- 3 knockout mutants displayed the same phenotype as wild-type N. crassa. Consistent with these phenotypic observations, deneddylation of cullin proteins in csn-1, csn-2, csn-4, csn-5, csn-6, or csn-7 mutants was dramatically impaired, while deletion of csn-3 did not cause any alteration in the neddylation/deneddylation state of cullins. We further demonstrated that CSN-1, CSN-2, CSN-4, CSN-5, CSN-6, and CSN-7, but not CSN-3, were essential for maintaining the stability of Cul1 in SCF complexes and Cul3 and BTB proteins in Cul3-BTB E3s, while five of the CSN subunits, but not CSN-3 and CSN-5, were also required for maintaining the stability of SKP-1 in SCF complexes. All seven CSN subunits were necessary for maintaining the stability of Cul4-DDB1 complexes. In addition, CSN-3 was also required for maintaining the stability of the SN-2 subunit and FWD-1 in the SCF

78651416165	Gear incipient fault diagnosis using graph theory and transductive support vector machine	In view of the severe shortage of samples for training in mechanical fault diagnosis, a novel method based on graph theory and transductive support vector machine (GTSVM) is presented for gear incipient fault diagnosis. By building a complete graph of original data matrix, a density-sensitive distance is defined to evaluate the dissimilarity between samples, which reflects the data structure well, and the well-known Iris data is used to verify the effectiveness. The vibration signals of gearbox under three running conditions (normal, slight spalling and severe spalling) are analyzed, and 11 time domain features are extracted from original data. Principal component analysis is adopted to select discriminative features, and graph theory is used to process the selected feature sets. Then, transductive support vector machine is trained by gradient descent learning and applied in fault detection and faults classification. The results using GTSVM method are compared with those using support vector machine and transductive support vector machine, which indicates the high classification accuracy of the proposed approach. Besides, the performance in failure detection is also improved through principal component analysis feature selection. Experiments show that the proposed method is effective in gear incipient fault diagnosis. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

78651083116	Fluorescence spectral characteristics of the supernatants from an anaerobic hydrogen-producing bioreactor	Microbial products formed in biological wastewater treatment systems are closely related to system performance and status, and many of them have fluorescence spectral characteristics. In this work, the fluorescence spectral characteristics of the supernatants from an anaerobic hydrogen-producing bioreactor were studied using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Since the components of the microbial products are complex, the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) method was used to extract the real spectra from the overlapped spectra. Two principal components were identified from the EEM spectra. The peaks at excitation-emission maxima of 280/350 and 350/440 nm were, respectively, attributed to the fluorescence of proteins and NADH. Their real concentrations were quantified using the PARAFAC coupled with the second-order calibration method. Results show that the formation rate of proteins was correlated to the production rate of hydrogen and volatile fatty acids, as well as the substrate degradation rate. A close correlation between the hydrogen partial pressure and the two fluorophores was found out. This study provides a reliable and convenient approach, which could be potentially used for monitoring the wastewater treatment reactor performance through measuring the fluorescence spectra of the supernatant. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78651292304	Optimal decomposition of limited memory influence diagrams	Complexity of solving influence diagrams increases exponentially in the number of decision variables. In Limited Memory Influence Diagrams (LIMIDs), some decisions must be made simultaneously and cooperatively and some may be independent of others. This paper partitions decision variables into different classes by an equivalent relation which decision variables in one class are dependent of each other, and two decisions contained in two different classes can be made independently. Moreover, relevant variables over classes of decision variables are defined. Then, based on relevant variables and requisite observations, influence diagrams can be decomposed into multiple local models, one of which consists of a class of decision variables and its requisite parents and relevant variables. Once influence diagrams have been decomposed, the optimal strategy can be determined by sub-strategies which can be found in sub-models independently. ©2010 IEEE.

Both electrodes of the sensor are leaded from the top side of the chip. When the initial gap of both electrodes formed the capacitor is 0.5 μm, and the side length of the square membrane is 710 μm, the sensitivity of 9.4 fF/hPa can be obtained.

Before the 21st passage of the in vitro culture, cell surface markers were analysed by flow cytometry; major histocompatibility complex expression was detected by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The tumorigenicity of HSMSCs was tested using SCID mice and observing changes in the injection site and pathological sections. Flow cytometry demonstrated that HSMSCs express CD73, CD105 and vimentin, but haematopoietic markers CD34, CD45 and CD19 were not expressed. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I and HLA-DR) mRNA was detected by RT-PCR; the protein expression of HLA-I was 29.5-31.7%, but HLA-DR protein expression was not detected in HSMSCs. The result of karyotype analysis before the 21st passage was normal and tumour formation was not detected in the mice. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that HSMSCs cultured in vitro may be safely transplanted in vivo, due to moderate expression of HLA-I and low expression of HLA-DR, non-tumorigenicity and normal karyotype. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Results show that the smaller the nozzle size and flow rate are, the more the number of nozzles will be required, and the finer the atomized droplet size will be produced, resulting in even distribution of droplets, high degree of droplet filling in the air-cooled unit and therefore obvious humidification effect. Maximum pressure drop(8.84 kPa) is to be obtained under the premise that the nozzle size is 0.4 m, spray pressure is 1.2 MPa, nozzles are symmetrically arranged 4 m away to trestle center of air fan, nozzle height is 0.3 m and the angle between nozzle direction and positive direction of y axis is 120° in the xy plane.

Therefore, through extracting key nodes coordinates of machine components and deformation information of finite element software calculated, we brought forward a space vector transfer algorithm, calculated the contribution of components for tools and work piece system and expressed impact of machine components on tool and work piece system by histogram. By this means,we can judge out the whole machine's weak links intuitively. Take XK713B Vertical Milling Machine as the case research object, extract key nodes and their deformation information of general structure such as lathe bed, column, headstock, sliding table, workbench etc. By using space vector transfer algorithm, the result shows that the largest contribution to tool system and workbench system is column, which is the weakest link in the whole machine and its vibration type is swing.

79960990244	Cdk1-phosphorylated CUEDC2 promotes spindle checkpoint inactivation and chromosomal instability	Aneuploidy and chromosomal instability are major characteristics of human cancer. These abnormalities can result from defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is a surveillance mechanism for accurate chromosome segregation through restraint of the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Here, we show that a CUE-domain-containing protein, CUEDC2, is a cell-cycle regulator that promotes spindle checkpoint inactivation and releases APC/C from checkpoint inhibition. CUEDC2 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 during mitosis. Depletion of CUEDC2 causes a checkpoint-dependent delay of the metaphase-anaphase transition. Phosphorylated CUEDC2 binds to Cdc20, an activator of APC/C, and promotes the release of Mad2 from APC/C-Cdc20 and subsequent APC/C activation. CUEDC2 overexpression causes earlier activation of APC/C, leading to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. Interestingly, CUEDC2 is highly expressed in many types of tumours. These results suggest that CUEDC2 is a key regulator of mitosis progression, and that CUEDC2 dysregulation might contribute to tumour development by causing chromosomal instability. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Without any pre-oxidation process, the residual concentration of As(III) after treated by the coagulant (concentration of 25mg/L) was less than 4μg/L, which can be satisfied the most rigid guideline for arsenic maximum contaminant level (MCL) proposed by WHO or USEPA. Operated with rapid water dynamics will get the better efficiency for As(III) removal. In the pH range of 3-6 the variation of As(III) removal efficiency was minimal, but the As(III) removal declined gradually with the increase of pH while in the alkaline range. Ferrous salts can significantly increase the efficiency of As(III) removal by coagulation treatment with mixed titanium salts as coagulant. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

79960809381	HLA haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for leukemia	BACKGROUND: For the patients without HLA sibling matched donor, performing HLA haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is confronted with problems such as severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) and high transplantation related mortality. Achieving the similar efficiency as sibling matched HSCT is possible by adopting different transplant methods. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of HLA haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for leukemia and compare with matched sibling HSCT. METHODS: A total of 45 patients diagnosed as leukemia were divided into two groups. For haploidentical cases, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with or without combination of bone marrow transplantation was performed. Conditioning regimen included modified busulphan/ cyclophosphamide with or without adding antithymocyte globulin. Cyclosporine A, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetile were used to prevent GVHD. For sibling matched patients, only peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was performed. Conditioning regimen included busulphan/ cyclophosphamide. Cyclosporine A and methotrexate were used for GVHD prevention. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the time of hematopoietic rebuilding between HLA-haploidentical and HLA-matched groups. The accumulative rates of acute GVHD were 73% versus 52% respectively between HLA-haploidentical and HLA-matched group (P > 0.05). The accumulative rate of chronic GVHD was 56% versus 45% (P > 0.05). Transplantation related mortality was 36% versus 17% (P > 0.05). There was no case relapse occurred in HLA-haploidentical group, but two cases relapse occurred in HLA-matched group. The expecting three-years accumulative rate of disease free survival was 61% versus 60% between HLA-haploidentical and HLA-matched groups (P > 0.05). Results indicate that the efficiency is similar between HLA haploidentical and matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for leukemia, but moderate to severe acute GVHD occurred higher in HLA haploidentical HSCT than HLA-matched HSCT.

A Bayesian inference based trust model, named Bayesian-based Trust Model (BTM), is proposed to address the detection of the selfish or malicious nodes. Under the proposed BTM, nodes in the network keep monitor their neighbors through packets listening. The results are analyzed based on Bayesian inference theory, and the first-hand trust factor is derived. Based on such first-hand trust factor, the nodes derive the second-hand trust factor using another Bayesian procedure. The second-hand trust factor can then be used for selfish or malicious nodes detection. Simulation results show that the proposed BTM can detect and distinguish selfish and malicious nodes accurately, and it is more suitable for intrusion detection system and secure routing protocol than current schemes.

It is found that the wavelet maxima statistics of the low frequency noise both from nMOSFETs and pMOSFETs are similar to the numerical signal generated by RTNs superposition. The discrepancy between the wavelet maxima statistics of nMOSFETs and that of pMOSFETs is quite trivial before ionizing radiation, whereas it becomes much more evident after radiation. Based on the wavelet maxima statistics analysis, it is concluded that the dominant low frequency noise generating mechanisms in both nMOSFETs and pMOSFETs are RTNs superposition. Ionizing radiation does not add new types of defects to the devices, but increase their density. nMOSFETs is damaged more severely than pMOSFETs during radiation.

84855287537	CUEDC2 (CUE domain-containing 2) and SOCS3 (suppressors of cytokine signaling 3) cooperate to negatively regulate Janus kinase 1/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 signaling	Janus kinase 1/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK1/STAT3) pathway is one of the recognized oncogenic signaling pathways that frequently overactivated in a variety of human tumors. Despite rapid progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of activation of JAK/STAT pathway, the processes that regulate JAK/STAT deactivation need to be further clarified. Here we demonstrate that CUE domain-containing 2 (CUEDC2) inhibits cytokine-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 and the subsequent STAT3 transcriptional activity. Further analysis by a yeast two-hybrid assay showed that CUEDC2 could engage in a specific interaction with a key JAK/STAT inhibitor, SOCS3 (suppressors of cytokine signaling 3). The interaction between CUEDC2 and SOCS3 is required for the inhibitory effect of CUEDC2 on JAK1 and STAT3 activity. Additionally, we found CUEDC2 functions collaboratively with SOCS3 to inhibit JAK1/STAT3 signaling by increasing SOCS3 stability via enhancing its association with Elongin C. Therefore, our findings revealed a new biological activity for CUEDC2 as the regulator of JAK1/STAT3 signaling and paved the way to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which SOCS3 has been linked to suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84855432881	Software defect prediction based on classifiers ensemble	Software defect prediction using classification algorithms was advocated by many researchers. However, several new literatures show the performance bottleneck by applying a single classifier recent years. On the other hand, classifiers ensemble can effectively improve classification performance than a single classifier. Motivated by above two reasons which indicate that defect prediction using classifiers ensemble methods have not fully be exploited, we conduct a comparative study of various ensemble methods with perspective of taxonomy. These methods included Bagging, Boosting, Random trees, Random forest, Random subspace, Stacking, and Voting. We also compared these ensemble methods to a single classifier Naive Bayes. A series of benchmarking experiments on public-domain datasets MDP show that applying classifiers ensemble methods to predict defect could achieve better performance than using a single classifier. Specially, in all seven ensemble methods evolved by our experiments, Voting and Random forest had obvious performance superiority than others, and Stacking also had better generalization ability. © 2009 by Binary Information Press.

Proteomics technique based on mass spectrometry now enables the system-wide characterization of signalling events at the levels of post-translational modifications, protein complex and changes in protein expression.

84859817106	Comparative autoantibody profiling before and after appearance of malignance: Identification of anti-cathepsin D autoantibody as a promising diagnostic marker for lung cancer	Cancer patients frequently develop autoantibodies. To test the hypothesis that the appearance of autoantibodies precedes the clinical diagnosis of cancer, we applied an immunoproteomic approach to compare autoantibody profiles before and after appearance of malignances. Proteins from A549 cells, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, were separated by two dimensional electrophoresis and then immunoblotted with serum samples from 8 individuals who were eventually diagnosed with lung cancer. Compared with autoantibody profiles from 3 years prior to the appearance of malignances, 21 immunoreactive spots newly appeared or presented with stronger staining intensity when clinical diagnoses were made. Among them, 10 matched spots on 2-DE gels were identified by mass spectrometry analysis as 5 proteins. With immunoprecipitation analysis, the antigenicity of protein cathepsin D was confirmed, and notably, in lung cancer sera, the occurrences of autoantibodies against the specific forms of cathepsin D differed significantly from the control groups (. p<. 0.05).

84859443042	Neurotoxicity of 1-bromopropane: Evidence from animal experiments and human studies	1-Bromopropane was introduced as an alternative to ozone layer-depleting solvents such as chlorofluorocarbons and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. However, a dozen human cases have been reported with symptoms and signs of toxicity to 1-bromopropane including numbness, diminished vibration sense in the lower extremities as well as ataxic gait. An epidemiological study also demonstrated dose-dependent prolongation of distal latency and decrease in vibration sense in the lower extremities. The initial animal experiments helped to identify and analyze the initial human case of 1-bromopropane toxicity. However, animal data that can explain the central nervous system disorders in humans are limited. Nonetheless, animal data should be carefully interpreted especially in a high-order function of the central nervous system or neurological signs such as ataxia that is influenced by fundamental anatomical/physiological differences between humans and animals. Enzymatic activity in the liver may explain partly the difference in the susceptibility between humans and animals, but further studies are needed to clarify the biological factors that can explain the difference and commonality among the species. © 2011.

This work presents a double-layer hierarchical model with conservation equations for both system and local phenomena in two analysis layers. A group of non-dimensional characteristic parameters are derived from the model to determine the basic design parameters for containment simulations. The volume-power ratio and the stanton number are the two most important parameters for process simulations. This work also provides design tools for different structures and mechanical criteria for facility design to reduce distortion during test.

84861233283	Constitutive MHC class i molecules negatively regulate TLR-triggered inflammatory responses via the Fps-SHP-2 pathway	The molecular mechanisms that fine-tune Toll-like receptor (TLR)-triggered innate inflammatory responses remain to be fully elucidated. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules can mediate reverse signaling and have nonclassical functions. Here we found that constitutively expressed membrane MHC class I molecules attenuated TLR-triggered innate inflammatory responses via reverse signaling, which protected mice from sepsis. The intracellular domain of MHC class I molecules was phosphorylated by the kinase Src after TLR activation, then the tyrosine kinase Fps was recruited via its Src homology 2 domain to phosphorylated MHC class I molecules. This led to enhanced Fps activity and recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-2, which interfered with TLR signaling mediated by the signaling molecule TRAF6. Thus, constitutive MHC class I molecules engage in crosstalk with TLR signaling via the Fps-SHP-2 pathway and control TLR-triggered innate inflammatory responses. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

84860459537	An online test structure for the thermal expansion coefficient of surface micromachined polysilicon beams by a pull-in approach	An online test structure for measuring the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of surface micromachined polysilicon beams is presented by using clampedclamped beams. In this structure, the polysilicon beam is heated by applying direct current voltage between two anchors, causing it to expand. The thermal expansion of the beam is restricted due to the clampedclamped boundary, while the pull-in voltage is measured by applying the other varying voltage between the beams and substrate. Based on the electrothermal properties of the test structure and the pull-in approach, an analytical model and an extracting method for the TEC are developed. Validation of the analytical model has been confirmed by FEM simulation and experiments. In the experiments, currentvoltage measurements are only required, and all measurements can be carried out in free air. Measured average value of the TEC is (2.49 0.03)×10

84862091164	On-line extraction structure for measuring registration error of MEMS manufacturing process	Registration error is one of the significant parameters of MEMS surface process. Its measurement and control is very important. At present, most measurements are through optomechanical methods, but these methods are too complex and need too much measuring time. An electronical test structure is developed to measure registration error between a conductive layer and an insulating layer, which can be used to measure registration error between sacrificial layer and polysilicon layer of MEMS surface process. By making an improvement on the tapered comb vernier structure in integrated circuit, we can convert the measurement of registration error into the measurement of resistance, realizing the electrical measurement of registration error rapidly. The theoretical resolution is 0.1μm. This method is simple and rapid, and can be used easily as a part of MEMS measurement system.

84862100800	Dynamic aspects of corneal lymphatic vessels after keratoplasty in rats	Objective: To study the development of lymphatic vessels after keratoplasty and to explore the molecular mechanisms of corneal lymphangiogenesis in transplanted corneas. Methods: Experimental research. The development of corneal lymphangiogenesis was examined by LYVE-1 immunohistochemistry and whole mount immunofluorescence 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 30 and 60 days after corneal transplantation, then lymphatic vessels counting (LVC) was evaluated. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) in transplanted corneas was examined by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and real time-PCR at same time. In addition, the inflammatory index (IF) was recorded at each time point. The association of VEGF-C and IF with LVC in transplanted corneas was examined. Analysis of the significance of differences between two groups was performed using paired Student's t-test. Pearson's analysis was used to analyze the correlation between VEGF-C, IF and LVC. Results: Corneal lymphangiogenesis occurred in the stroma with LVC (1.8 ± 0.3) on Day 3, then developed and reached the peak with LVC (9.1 ± 1.5) on Day 14 after corneal transplantation. Both VEGF-C protein and mRNA up-regulated dramatically in rat transplanted corneas. The immunoreactivity reached the peak on the 3rd day and the 14th day after keratoplasty. Compared with the expression of VEGF-C mRNA (1.62 ± 0.08 copies/g) on Day 3, the expression of VEGF-C mRNA (2.48 ± 0.03 copies/g) significantly increased 14 days after the transplantation (t = 4.296, P=0.02). LVC was strongly and positively correlated with IF (r = 0.55, P = 0.003) and the expression of VEGF-C mRNA (r = 0.51, P = 0.003). Conclusions: Corneal lymphangiogenesis correlates closely with corneal inflammation. The increased expression of VEGF-C in the cornea may be one of the important molecular mechanisms in the occurrence of corneal lymphangiogenesis after keratoplasty.

84862837453	Repression of endometrial tumor growth by targeting SREBP1 and lipogenesis	The aberrantly increased lipogenesis is a universal metabolic feature of proliferating tumor cells. Although most normal cells acquire the bulk of their fatty acids from circulation, tumor cells synthesize more than 90% of required lipids de novo. The sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), encoded by SREBF1 gene, is a master regulator of lipogenic gene expression. SREBP1 and its target genes are overexpressed in a variety of cancers; however, the role of SREBP1 in endometrial cancer is largely unknown. We have screened a cohort of endometrial cancer (EC) specimen for their lipogenic gene expression and observed a significant increase of SREBP1 target gene expression in cancer cells compared with normal endometrium. By using immunohistochemical staining, we confirmed SREBP1 protein overexpression and demonstrated increased nuclear distribution of SREBP1 in EC. In addition, we found that knockdown of SREBP1 expression in EC cells suppressed cell growth, reduced colonigenic capacity and slowed tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of SREBP1 induced significant cell death in cultured EC cells. Taken together, our results show that SREBP1 is essential for EC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that SREBP1 activity may be a novel therapeutic target for endometrial cancers. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84862223739	Increasing lymphatic microvessel density in primary pterygia	Objective: To examine lymphatic microvessel density (LMVD) in primary pterygia. Methods: We included tissue samples from 88 excised primary (including 34 grade 1, 28 grade 2, and 26 grade 3) pterygia and from 7 nasal epibulbar conjunctivae segments used as control samples. Sections from each pterygium were immunostained with CD31 and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) monoclonal antibodies to evaluate LMVD and blood microvessel density. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to measure expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and VEGF-C messenger RNA (mRNA) in the pterygia. Results: A small number of CD31-positive LYVE-1-negative blood vessels and only a few CD31- and LYVE- 1-positive lymphatic vessels were detected in the normal epibulbar conjunctiva segments. Lymphatic vessels were mildly increased in grade 1 pterygia but were dramatically increased in grades 2 and 3 pterygia. Lymphatic microvessel density correlated closely with blood microvessel density in grades 1, 2, and 3 pterygia (P<.05 for all). The width and area of pterygia were significantly correlated with LMVD. In addition, we found a significant relationship between VEGF-C mRNA expression and LMVD in grades 1, 2, and 3 pterygia, whereas VEGF-A mRNA expression correlated closely with LMVD only in grade 1 pterygia. Conclusions: Lymphatic microvessel density increases dramatically in grades 2 and 3 pterygia. Transient upregulation of VEGF-C might be responsible for the occurrence of lymphangiogenesis.

With the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) method, the EEM fluorescence spectra and the relative concentration of three components, i.e., proteins, NADH and riboflavin, were acquired. Results showed that the relative concentration of the three fluorophores varied correspondingly when the temperature was increased from 50°C to 60°C, and they were correlated to the operating parameters of the UASB reactor. Furthermore, riboflavin was a specific fluorophore in the effluents from the thermophilic UASB reactor. Using standard addition method and second-order calibration approach, the concentrations of the riboflavin were obtained, which varied from 0.04 to 0.13 mg·L

As the well performance in dealing with evolving surface, the FMM has been improved and introduced into three-dimensional (3D) lithography simulation of thick photoresists such as SU-8 photoresist. A stationary level set formulation of lithography simulation has been established, and solved at an extremely fast speed.

In past, clustering is designed on distance or similar property. Generally, clustering is a multi-input and multi-output algorithm. When data is trained, the learning process of every class is independent. Multi-task learning is a learning machine that utilizes the shared representation among correlated tasks to train. Through shared representation, we could improve a learning machine's generalization and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce multi-task learning methods into Learning Vector Quantization algorithm.

Methods: Immunohistochemical staining was deployed to determine the protein levels of DACH1. Staining was performed on patient samples, for whom the detailed follow-up data have been acquired during the last 10 years. Normal, benign, borderline, cancer, and metastatic ovarian cancer samples were included in this study. Results: The results of our study show that DACH1 protein levels increase with the invasiveness of the ovarian cancer. As the cancer progresses from benign and borderline to metastatic, DACH1 protein expression increases as well. Moreover, with the increase in expression, the subcellular distribution of DACH1 changes from nucleus in normal tissue to cytoplasm in cancer. Finally, DACH1 expression levels were compared with estrogen receptor α (ERα) levels, and the results showed that overall DACH1 levels were higher, whereas also DACH1 exhibited increased cytoplasmic expression in ERα-positive ovarian cancer samples. Conclusions: These results indicate that DACH1 is highly expressed in metastatic ovarian cancer compared with that of normal, benign, and borderline ovarian tissues and that it could play an important role in cancer growth.

84863264796	Phage display against corneal epithelial cells produced bioactive peptides that inhibit Aspergillus adhesion to the corneas	Dissection of host-pathogen interactions is important for both understanding the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and developing therapeutics for the infectious diseases like various infectious keratitis. To enhance the knowledge about pathogenesis infectious keratitis, a random 12-mer peptide phage display library was screened against cultured human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC). Fourteen sequences were obtained and BLASTp analysis showed that most of their homologue counterparts in GenBank were for defined or putative proteins in various pathogens. Based on known or predicted functions of the homologue proteins, ten synthetic peptides (Pc-A to Pc-J) were measured for their affinity to bind cells and their potential efficacy to interfere with pathogen adhesion to the cells. Besides binding to HCEC, most of them also bound to human corneal stromal cells and umbilical endothelial cells to different extents. When added to HCEC culture, the peptides induced expression of MyD88 and IL-17 in HCEC, and the stimulated cell culture medium showed fungicidal potency to various extents. While peptides Pc-C and Pc-E inhibited Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f) adhesion to HCEC in a dose-dependent manner, the similar inhibition ability of peptides Pc-A and Pc-B required presence of their homologue ligand Alb1p on A.f. When utilized in an eyeball organ culture model and an in vivo A.f keratitis model established in mouse, Pc-C and Pc-E inhibited fungal adhesion to corneas, hence decreased corneal disruption caused by inflammatory infiltration. Affinity pull-down of HCEC membrane proteins with peptide Pc-C revealed several molecules as potential receptors for this peptide. In conclusion, besides proving that phage display-selected peptides could be utilized to interfere with adhesion of pathogens to host cells, hence could be exploited for managing infectious diseases including infectious keratitis, we also proposed that the phage display technique and the resultant peptides could be used to explore host-pathogen interactions at molecular levels. © 2012 Zhao et al.

84865172216	Gankyrin gene deletion followed by proteomic analysis: Insight into the roles of Gankyrin in Tumorigenesis and Metastasis	Background: Gankyrin was originally purified and characterized as the p28 component of the 26S proteasome, and later identified as an oncogenic protein in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). It has recently been found to be highly expressed in several other malignancies, and compelling evidence show gankyrin plays important roles in tumorigenesis. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Methods: In order to further clarify the functions of gankyrin and better understand its molecular mechanisms, we generated a gankyrin null cell line, HCT116 gankyrin?/? , by targeted homologous recombination in human colon cancer cells, and then employed two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) based proteomic approaches followed by MS identification to investigate alterations in the proteome due to the gankyrin knockout. Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were also used to examine the protein and mRNA levels of some identified proteins. Results: Compared with wild-type control cells, gankyrin null cells were impaired in terms of their proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth. A total of 21 altered proteins were identified, which included 18 proteins that had not previously been reported to be related to gankyrin. Notably, eight metastasis-related proteins were identified. Western blot analyses confirmed that the changes in three examined proteins were consistent with 2-DE gel analysis. Conclusions: In summary, we have generated a useful cell tool to clarify the functions of gankyrin. Our proteomic data provide novel information to better understand the roles and underlying mechanisms by which gankyrin is involved in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis. © 2012 Luo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84870677367	A new adaptive feedback learning algorithm for multitask learning	Within a learning machine, we could improve the accuracy of every learning task while a few tasks learned together. This method is called multitask learning. It is popular to using simulated annealing algorithm or setting a constant as learning rate in multitask learning. Either is simple and efficiently. But neither use feedback information in machine effectively. A novel adaptive feedback learning algorithm (AFLA) for multitask learning is proposed in this paper. The AFLA is proposed to address the problem using feedback information in multitask learning machine. The AFLA uses the error signal as feedback information. And it applies error signal in learning rate. The experiments are carried on two datasets. With simulated annealing and constant comparisons, experimental results show that the AFLA can use error signal efficiently. At normal learning rate, the accuracy of AFLA is better than using simulated annealing algorithm and constant. At smaller learning rate, the accuracy of AFLA is 2-5 times as big as others. © 2012 IEEE.

84870388822	Reciprocal Regulation of Akt and Oct4 Promotes the Self-Renewal and Survival of Embryonal Carcinoma Cells	Signaling via the Akt serine/threonine protein kinase plays critical roles in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and their malignant counterpart, embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs). Here we show that in ECCs, Akt phosphorylated the master pluripotency factor Oct4 at threonine 235, and that the levels of phosphorylated Oct4 in ECCs correlated with resistance to apoptosis and tumorigenic potential. Phosphorylation of Oct4 increased its stability and facilitated its nuclear localization and its interaction with Sox2, which promoted the transcription of the core stemness genes POU5F1 and NANOG. Furthermore, in ECCs, unphosphorylated Oct4 bound to the AKT1 promoter and repressed its transcription. Phosphorylation of Oct4 by Akt resulted in dissociation of Oct4 from the AKT1 promoter, which activated AKT1 transcription and promoted cell survival. Therefore, a site-specific, posttranslational modification of the Oct4 protein orchestrates the regulation of its stability, subcellular localization, and transcriptional activities, which collectively promotes the survival and tumorigenicity of ECCs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

HeLa human cervical cancer cells were treated with 10 nM AZD8055 for 24, 48 or 72 h. MTT was used to determine cell proliferation. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining was used to determine cell apoptosis analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Glycolytic activity was determined by measuring the activity of the key enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lactate production. RNA and protein expression were examined by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Treatment with AZD8055 inhibited proliferation and glycolysis, and induced apoptosis in HeLa cells in a time-dependent manner. During the prolonged treatment with AZD8055, the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 substrates p70S6K and phosphorylation of the mTORC2 substrate Akt were deregulated, suggesting that the activity of mTOR was downregulated. Furthermore, our study showed that the expression of miR-143 was upregulated in a time-dependent manner in HeLa cells treated with AZD8055. In summary, the present study reveals a novel antitumor mechanism of AZD8055 in HeLa human cervical cancer cells.

84872371410	A bidirectional backup routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks	In mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), due to rapidly changing network topology, routing break occurs frequently. Ad hoc on-demand distance vector adaptive backup with local repair routing (AODV-ABL) protocol creates and maintains backup routes to the destination node by overhearing data packets to increase the success rate of repairing invalid routes. However, AODV-ABL may lose some backup routes with one hop distance to the destination node, and cannot adjust the primary routes in time to adapt to the dynamic topology. In this paper, based on AODV-ABL, an AODV bidirectional fast adaptive backup local repair (AODV-BFABL) routing protocol for bidirectional traffic load scenarios is proposed, which can maintain the bidirectional routes to the destination and source nodes to reduce route failures. In order to improve the adaptability of AODV-BFABL, the primary routes are merged with the backup routes and the routes are updated when transmitting the data packets. Simulation results show that AODV-BFABL has better packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and control overhead than AODV-ABL. © 2012 IEEE.

84873253560	Natural circulation differential pressure measurement correction technology based on IAPWS-IF97	The low temperature nuclear heating reactor (NHR), developed by Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology of Tsinghua University, is highly safe because of its natural circulation at full power level. The driving force of natural circulation is very low, so the flow rate is highly affected by the resistance of the reactor coolant loop. As a result, reducing the flow resistance is a key technology of NHR design. A experiment equipment, which simulated the natural circulation of the reactor coolant loop, was constructed to validate the design. The pressure drop was measured by differential pressure transmitters. The temperature difference of the water in different impulse tubes introduced density difference, which led to large measurement error. Considering the high precision of IAPWS-97, an ActiveX control was developed based on IAPWS-97 to calculate the density of water at deferent pressures and temperatures. The control was used in the data acquisition system based on configuration software platform and the online correction of differential pressure measurement was realized. The testing data analysis shows that the precision of the corrected differential pressure measurement results is highly improved.

84873952052	Measurement of material properties for polysilicon thin films by an electrostatic force method	This paper presentsa novel in-situ test structure for determining Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of polysilicon thin films, based on electrostatic driving mechanism. The test structure manufactured with polysilicon surface processes, include two parts, one is used for the measurement of Young's modulus, and the other is used for the measurement of Poisson's ratio. By monitoring the deflection of polysilicon beams under the electrostatic force, the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio can be obtained analytically. Validation and accuracy of the extracting method have been verified by FEM simulation andexperiments. The main advantage of this approach lies in the avoidance of the pull-in phenomena. The test structure can be widely used in MEMS process monitoring and the in-situ extraction of material properties. © 2012 IEEE.

84874677168	GC_NDMR: A stable and low latency multipath routing protocol in connectivity of MANET and internet	Using multipath routing technology in MANET can improve network stability and reduce end-to-end latency. This paper proposes a Gateway-Centric, Node-Disjoint Multipath Routing Protocol called GC_NDMR to provide efficient data transmission scheme in the connectivity of MANET and Internet. The main idea of GC_NDMR is setting up multipath routing from source nodes to the gateway in MANET, and assigning data flows on multipath based on hops and latency algorithm. Simulation shows that, compared with single path routing protocol AODV interconnect scheme, GC_NDMR has more stable and low end-to-end latency performance.

84875511063	Characterizing the interactions between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fulvic acids in water	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals and are listed as priority pollutants by the US EPA. Although they are sparsely soluble in water, their solubility can be increased by binding to dissolved organic matter in natural waters, which will further increase their environmental risk as toxic pollutants. In this study, the interaction between PAHs, exemplified by fluorene and anthracene, and fulvic acid (FA) was studied using fluorescence quenching titration method with fluorescence emission spectra, respectively. The association of FA with the mixture of fluorene and anthracene was also evaluated by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectrometry combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Results demonstrate that EEM fluorescence spectrometry with PARAFAC analysis was sensitive and reliable to determine the binding properties of PAHs with FA in a mixed aqueous solution. The conditional stability constants and binding capacities show that both PAHs bind to FA tightly. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84875208009	Tumor-suppressive effects of CDK8 in endometrial cancer cells	CDK8 is either amplified or mutated in a variety of human cancers, and CDK8 functions as an oncoprotein in melanoma and colorectal cancers. Previously, we reported that loss or reduction of CDK8 results in aberrant fat accumulation in Drosophila and mammals, suggesting that CDK8 plays an important role in inhibiting lipogenesis. Epidemiological studies have identified obesity and overweight as the major risk factors of endometrial cancer, thus we examined whether CDK8 regulates endometrial cancer cell growth by using several endometrial cancer cell lines, including KLE, which express low levels of CDK8, as well as AN3 CA and HEC-1A cells, which have high levels of endogenous CDK8. We observed that ectopic expression of CDK8 in KLE cells inhibited cell proliferation and potently blocked tumor growth in an in vivo mouse model. In addition, gain of CDK8 in KLE cells blocked cell migration and invasion in transwell, wound healing and persistence of migratory directionality assays. Conversely, we observed the opposite effects in all of the aforementioned assays when CDK8 was depleted in AN3 CA cells. Similar to AN3 CA cells, depletion of CDK8 in HEC-1A cells strongly enhanced cell migration in transwell assays, while overexpression of CDK8 in HEC-1A cells blocked cell migration. Furthermore, gene profiling of KLE cells overexpressing CDK8 revealed genes whose protein products are involved in lipid metabolism, cell cycle and cell movement pathways. Finally, depletion of CDK8 increased the expression of lipogenic genes in endometrial cancer cells. Taken together, these results show a reverse correlation between CDK8 levels and several key features of the endometrial cancer cells, including cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as tumor formation in vivo. Therefore, in contrast to the oncogenic effects of CDK8 in melanoma and colorectal cancers, our results suggest that CDK8 plays a tumor-suppressive role in endometrial cancers. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84875212441	ECHS1 interacts with STAT3 and negatively regulates STAT3 signaling	Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical transcriptional factor in a variety of cellular processes, and is frequently over-activated in a range of human tumors. However, the processes that regulate STAT3 activation need to be further clarified. With a yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified enoyl-CoA hydratase short chain 1 (ECHS1) as a novel STAT3 binding protein. We further confirmed the interaction between STAT3 and ECHS1 by GST-pull down and co-immnunoprecipitation. Importantly, we found that ECHS1 specifically represses STAT3 activity and negatively regulates the expression of several target genes of STAT3 through inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation. Therefore, our findings will provide new insights into the mechanism of STAT3 signaling regulation. Structured summary of protein interactions: STAT3 physically interacts with ECHS1 by pull down (View interaction) STAT3 physically interacts with ECHS1 by two hybrid (View Interaction: 1, 2) ECHS1 physically interacts with STAT3 by anti tag co immunoprecipitation (View Interaction: 1, 2) STAT3 physically interacts with ECHS1 by anti bait co immunoprecipitation (View interaction). © 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

84875255449	RAD23A negatively regulates RIG-I/MDA5 signaling through promoting TRAF2 polyubiquitination and degradation	RIG-I/MDA5 plays a pivotal role in innate immunity by detecting intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activating the transcription of type I interferons and proinflammatory factors, but the exactly regulating mechanism of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling remains elusive. In this study, UbL-UBA domain containing protein RAD23A was identified as a negative regulator of RIG-I/MDA5-mediated signaling activation through a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screening. Knockdown of RAD23A augmented the expression of RIG-I/MDA5-mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-β whereas ectopic expression of RAD23A showed the converse effect. Moreover, we confirmed the interaction between RAD23A and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an essential mediator of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling, and found that RAD23A down-regulated TRAF2 protein level through ubiquitin-proteasome system. Therefore, this study identified RAD23A as a novel negative regulator of RIG-I/MDA5 mediated anti-virus response. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Among them, self-organizing maps (SOMs) have been used effectively as they preserve the topological relationships of data. However, the structures of data clusters learned by SOMs may not be apparent and their shapes are often distorted. This paper presents a semisupervised diagnosis method based on a distance-preserving SOM for machine-fault detection and classification, which can also be used to visualize the SOM learning results directly. An experimental study performed on a gearbox and bearings indicated that the developed approach is effective in detecting incipient gear-pitting failure and classifying different bearing defects and levels of ball-bearing defects. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

Further studies were carried on 8 cases ex vivo colon adenocarcinoma samples which exceptionally exhibited 635 nm fluorescence emission under 405 nm excitation. The time-resolved fluorescence spectra at 635 nm emission under 405 nm excitation were also measured and two-exponential decay fitting was performed to determine the fluorescence lifetime at 635 nm emission. Significant difference was observed between the spectra of normal and cancer tissues, which included an emission peak at 635 nm under the excitation wavelengths of 405 nm. There was also a significant difference between the fluorescence lifetimes of 635 nm emission of the normal tissue and cancer tissue (P<0.05). These results demonstrate that the spectroscopic analysis method allows a selective detection of adenocarcinoma tissues. This spectral profile and lifetime of the red fluorescence resemble that of porphyrins, which suggests that porphyrin fluorescence may be a useful biomarker for characterizing colon cancers of certain patient populations. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.

84879274956	Pattern recognition of multiple excitation autofluorescence spectra for colon tissue classification	Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the usefulness of multiple excitation autofluorescence (AF) and a spectral feature-based pattern recognition in classification of colon tissues. Materials and methods: Under four different excitation wavelengths (337, 375, 405 and 460. nm), AF spectra of freshly excised normal and adenocarcinoma colon tissues were measured. Pattern recognition method including features extraction, data reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fisher's discriminant analysis (FDA) were performed for classification. Results: There was a significantly difference between spectral patterns of normal and adenocarcinoma tissues. Compared with the other three excitation wavelengths, the AF spectra obtained under 337. nm excitation provided more diagnostic information, but also more sensitive to the trivial change resulted from neoplastic transformation. For discriminating normal from adenocarcinoma tissues, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy using 337. nm excitation in the present study were 88.9%, 80.0% and 83.9%, respectively. Compared these values with those determined from multispectral data analysis, our findings indicate that the latter has higher specificity while maintaining the same sensitivity (sensitivity 88.9% vs. 88.9%, specificity 91.4% vs. 80.0%, and accuracy 90.3% vs. 83.9%). Conclusion: This study suggests that the pattern recognition of the multiple excitation AF spectra is an effective algorithm for improving the diagnostic accuracy of adenocarcinoma. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The structures are heated electrically and deflect due to the thermal expansion. The lateral displacements of the devices are related to the thermal stress and residual stress of the test beams. The micro-rotating structures are arranged, so that the lateral displacements are designed to be either a constant value which is used to determine the TEC of the thin film or a variable value that changes with the residual stress of the thin film. An analytical model of the test structure is presented. The finite element software ANSYS is used to verify the analytical model and provide guidelines for the structure design. Experimental results with a surface micromachined polysilicon thin film are used to demonstrate the proposed method. In the experiments, a current-voltage measurement system only is required.

CCA secure public verifiable public key encryption has many applications such as threshold public key encryption and proxy re-encryption etc. Furthermore, these years "random oracle model" has seen risen criticize by many cryptographers. Hence, researchers give great effort to pursue public key public key encryption with publicly verifiability in the standard model. However, all the existing CCA secure publicly verifiable public key encryption in the standard model relies on costly bilinear pairing. In this paper, based on Hanaoka and Kurosawa's efficient CCA secure public key encryption under Computational Diffle-Hellman assumption proposed in Asiacrypt'08 and the famous Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme, we try to construct a CCA secure public verifiable public key encryption without pairing in the standard model. As a result of its application, we achieve a CCA secure public verifiable threshold public key encryption without pairing in the standard model, a CCA secure unidirectional proxy re-encryption without pairing in the standard model. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

84880621589	Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 is required for ovarian tumor growth	Re-programming of lipogenic signaling is one of the most significant alterations of tumor cell pathology. Consistent with a large demand for lipids, tumor cells express high levels of lipogenic enzymes, most of which are transcriptional targets of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). However, the expression levels and the function of SREBP1 in ovarian cancer are largely unknown. Our study aimed to assess the oncogenic potential of SREBP1 in ovarian cancer. In this study, we showed that the SREBP1 protein expression was significantly higher in human ovarian cancer compared to benign and borderline ovarian tumors by immunohistochemical staining. Knockdown of SREBP1 by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in ovarian cancer cells retarded cell growth, migration and invasion and enhanced cell apoptosis without significant effects on cell cycle distribution. In a xenograft SCID mouse model, SREBP1 silencing inhibited tumor growth in vivo and reduced the expression of SREBP1 downstream lipogenic genes at both the protein and mRNA levels. Taken together, the results from this study demonstrate a crucial role of SREBP1 in ovarian cancer growth, which establish SREBP1 as a novel therapeutic target for antitumor therapy.

84880322795	Allograft survival enhancement using doxycycline in alkali-burned mouse corneas	Purpose: To explore the inhibitory effects of doxycycline on allograft rejection in alkali-burned cornea beds. Methods: The corneas of BALB/c mice were injured using a 1 mol/l NaOH solution. Following the injury, the corneas from C57BL/6 mice were transplanted into the eyes of BALB/c mice after being randomized into three groups: allogeneic corneal transplantation (group A), topical use of doxycycline after allogeneic corneal transplantation (group B) and syngeneic corneal transplantation (group C). Corneal angiogenesis was examined using whole-mount immunofluorescence, and corneal inflammation was evaluated using inflammation index scoring. The immune rejection of the grafts was examined using a slit lamp. In addition, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A and interleukin-1β in the transplanted corneas was examined using a real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The outgrowth of the corneal blood vessels in the group A mice was faster than that in the group B and group C mice. The inflammation index levels were highest in the group A mice, intermediate in the group B mice and lowest in the group C mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor and the interleukin-1β protein and mRNA levels decreased dramatically in the group B mice compared with the group A mice (all p-values < 0.01). In addition, the mean survival time in the group B mice (27.00 ± 2.00 days) was significantly longer than that in the group A mice (11.67 ± 1.51 days; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Doxycycline may have had a significant role in preventing corneal angiogenesis and inflammation in alkali-burned corneal beds, which resulted in higher allograft survival rates. © 2013 The Authors.

84881574838	Effects of ceftriaxone-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis on dendritic cells of small intestine in mice	Intestinal microflora plays a pivotal role in the development of the innate immune system and is essential in shaping adaptive immunity. Dysbacteriosis of intestinal microflora induces altered immune responses and results in disease susceptibility. Dendritic cells (DCs), the professional antigen-presenting cells, have gained increasing attention because they connect innate and adaptive immunity. They generate both immunity in response to stimulation by pathogenic bacteria and immune tolerance in the presence of commensal bacteria. However, few studies have examined the effects of intestinal dysbacteriosis on DCs. In this study, changes of DCs in the small intestine of mice under the condition of dysbacteriosis induced by ceftriaxone sodium were investigated. It was found that intragastric administration of ceftriaxone sodium caused severe dysteriosis in mice. Compared with controls, numbers of DCs in mice with dysbacteriosis increased significantly (P=0.0001). However, the maturity and antigen-presenting ability of DCs were greatly reduced. In addition, there was a significant difference in secretion of IL-10 and IL-12 between DCs from mice with dysbacteriosis and controls. To conclude, ceftriaxone-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis strongly affected the numbers and functions of DCs. The present data suggest that intestinal microflora plays an important role in inducing and maintaining the functions of DCs and thus is essential for the connection between innate and adaptive immune responses. © 2013 The Societies and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84880881002	Gankyrin activates IL-8 to promote hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer	Hepatic metastasis is responsible for the majority of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortalities. Although Gankyrin (PSMD10) has been implicated in cancer metastasis, its exact role and underlying mechanisms of CRC hepatic metastasis remain largely unknown. Herein, we showed that the expression of Gankyrin was higher in primary CRC with hepatic metastasis compared with CRC without metastasis. RNAi-mediated silencing of Gankyrin expression in highly metastatic human CRC cells impaired their migratory and metastatic capacity in vivo. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling revealed activation of the interleukin (IL)-8 signaling pathway by Gankyrin. Protein levels of IL-8 and cyclin D1 (CCND1), the two important molecules in the IL-8 pathway, were positively correlated with Gankyrin expression in human CRC specimens. Furthermore, genetic deletion of cyclin D1 showed its requirement in Gankyrin-mediated cell migration. Finally, administration of recombinant IL-8 rescued the migratory defect of CRC cells where Gankyrin expression was silenced. Together, our findings highlight the importance of Gankyrin in hepatic metastasis of CRC and point out its candidature as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target to improve the clinical management of metastatic CRC. © 2013 AACR.

Methods: Nifeviroc vaginal thermosensitive in situ gel (NFVR-TISG) was prepared using poloxamer407 and poloxamer188 as the gel matrix. Rheological parameters of NFVR-TISG and the NFVR-TISG diluted by stimulant vaginal fluid (SVF) were measured during phase transition at different temperatures, and gelation temperature was estimated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Results: NFVR-TISG was Newtonian fluid with low viscoelasticity under room temperature and was converted to gel at 29°C. With the increase of temperature, the sol-gel transition process showed exponential increase and the phase angle showed decrease. The gelation temperature of NFVR-TISG detected by DSC was 30.4°C, similar to that measured by dynamic rheological studies. Conclusion: The rheological properties of NFVR-TISG meet the requirements for vaginal topical use. Dynamic rheological experiment may provide useful information for further in vitro evaluation of viscoelastic hydrodynamic properties of thermosensitive in situ gel.

However, the manual frequency band selection limits its accuracy in extracting transient features from a noisy signal and identifying defects, especially for detecting an incipient defect of the bearing. Because the complex Morlet wavelets have the similar time-frequency structure with the impact energy generated by faulty bearings, we propose an automatically frequency band selection method based on the Morlet wavelets filter and spectral kurtosis. The vibration signals of two bearings are analyzed using the proposed method. And the results indicate that, comparing with the original envelope spectrum and the FIR filter based kurtogram, the proposed approach is effective and practical. © 2013 IEEE.

These information service companies provide applications, such as data storage, computing processes, document sharing and even management information system services as public resources to support the business process management of their customers. However, no cloud computing service vendor can satisfy the full functional IS requirements of an enterprise. As a result, enterprises often have to simultaneously use systems distributed in different clouds and their intra enterprise ISs. Thus, this article presents a framework to integrate applications deployed in public clouds and intra ISs.

84881556608	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2: A novel gene involved in zebrafish central nervous system development	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (Tfpi-2) is an important serine protease inhibitor in the extracellular matrix (ECM), but its precise physiological significance remains unknown. This work is part of a series of studies intended to investigate functional roles of Tfpi-2 and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. First, we cloned and identified zebrafish Tfpi-2 (zTfpi-2) as an evolutionarily conserved protein essential for zebrafish development. We also demonstrated that ztfpi-2 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of zebrafish, and embryonic depletion of ztfpi-2 caused severe CNS defects. In addition, changes of neural markers, including pax2a, egr2b, huC, ngn1, gfap and olig2, confirmed the presence of developmental abnormalities in the relevant regions of ztfpi-2 morphants. Using microarray analysis, we found that members of the Notch pathway, especially her4 and mib, which mediate lateral inhibition in CNS development, were also downregulated. Intriguingly, both her4 and mib were able to partially rescue the ztfpi-2 morphant phenotype. Furthermore, Morpholino knockdown of ztfpi-2 resulted in upregulation of neuronal markers while downregulation of glial markers, providing evidence that the Notch pathway is probably involved in ztfpi-2-mediated CNS development. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

These information service companies provide applications as public resources to support the business operation of their customers. However, no cloud computing service vendor (CCSV) can satisfy the full functional information system requirements of its customers. As a result, its customers often have to simultaneously use services distributed in different clouds and do some connectivity jobs manually. Services convergence and multi-clouds integration will lead to new business models and trigger new integration technologies that provide solutions to satisfy IT users' complicated requirements. This paper firstly reviews the development of cloud computing from business and technical viewpoints and then discusses requirements and challenges of services convergence and multi-clouds integrations. Thirdly, a model based architecture of multi-clouds integration is provided. Business logic modelling for cross-organizational collaboration, service modelling and operation modelling methods with relative model mapping technology are discussed in detail. Some key enabling technologies are also developed. At last, case studies are presented to illustrate the implementation of the technologies developed in the paper. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84883692728	Gap adjustable MEMS comb resonator	A new structure of gap adjustable MEMS resonator has been proposed, and an analytical model of the gap adjustable structure has been developed. This model is a 2D vibration system. An opposite type MATA was used to push the fixed finger structure to move, as a result, the gap between the fingers changed. Simulation results show that the displacement of the mechanical oscillator increased when the MATA provided a step force, and the vibration amplitude was modulated when the force was in a cyclical form. In order to improve the stability of the structure, the folded beams were changed into clamped beams. An FEA simulation told us that when the gap changed, the vibration amplitude increased. © 2013 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

84884942071	Pre-induced adult human peripheral blood mononuclear cells migrate widely into the degenerative retinas of rd1 mice	Background aims: Recent advances in stem cell research have raised the possibility of stem cells repairing or replacing retinal photoreceptor cells that are either dysfunctional or lost in many retinal diseases. Various types of stem cells have been used to replace retinal photoreceptor cells. Recently, peripheral blood stem cells, a small proportion of pluripotent stem cells, have been reported to mainly exist in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Methods: In this study, the effects of pre-induced adult human PBMCs (hPBMCs) on the degenerative retinas of rd1 mice were investigated. Freshly isolated adult hPBMCs were pre-induced with the use of the conditioned medium of rat retinas for 4 days and were then labeled with chloromethyl-benzamidodialkylcarbocyanine (CM-DiI) and then transplanted into the subretinal space of the right eye of rd1 mice through a trans-scleral approach. The right eyes were collected 30 days after transplantation. The survival and migration of the transplanted cells in host retinas were investigated by whole-mount retinas, retinal frozen sections and immunofluorescent staining. Results: After subretinal transplantation, pre-induced hPBMCs were able to survive and widely migrate into the retinas of rd1 mice. A few CM-DiI-labeled cells migrated into the inner nuclear layer and the retinalganglion cell layer. Some transplanted cells in the subretinal space of rd1 host mice expressed the human photoreceptor-specific marker rhodopsin. Conclusions: This study suggests that pre-induced hPBMCs may be a potential cell source of cell replacement therapy for retinal degenerative diseases. © 2013 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

84884945334	Multitask fuzzy learning with rule weight	In fuzzy learning system based on rule weight, certainty grade, denoted by membership function of fuzzy set, defines how close a rule to a classification. In this system, several rules can correspond to same classification. But it cannot reflect the changing while training several tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose multitask fuzzy learning based on error-correction, and define belonging grade to show how much a sample belongs to a rule. Experimental results demonstrate efficiency of multitask fuzzy learning, and multitask learning could help to improve learning machine's prediction. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

However, multitask learning, proposed by Rich Caruana, sees simultaneously training several correlated tasks is helpful to improve single task's performance. In this paper, we propose a new neural network - multitask similarity cluster. Combined with hellinger distance, multitask similarity cluster can estimate distances among clusters more accurate. Experimental results show multitask learning is helpful to improve performance of single task and multitask similarity cluster can get satisfactory result. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

In addition, its Euler equation is of symplectic structure character.Based on this vairiational principle, a symplectic algorithm was presented, combining the finite element method in space domain with the time subdomain method, in which the cubic spline interpolation was applied as approximation. The results of numerical examples show that the method is a highly efficient method with better computational performance and superior ability of stability compared with Wilson-θ and Newmark-β methods.

84886065694	Generation of human epidermis-derived mesenchymal stem cell-like pluripotent cells (hEMSCPCs)	We isolated human epidermis-derived mesenchymal stem cell-like pluripotent cells (hEMSCPCs) and demonstrate efficient harvesting, maintenance in vitro for at least 30 passages, reprogramming into multiple phenotypes in vivo, and integration into adult host tissues after injection into the mouse blastocyst to create chimeras. Cell phenotype was examined by karyotyping, immunostaining, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. A nested PCR protocol using primers specific for human SRY genes was designed to detect hEMSCPC-derived cells in female chimeric mice. FISH was used to validate the results of nested PCR. Results indicated that hEMSCPCs were derived from epidermis but were distinct from epidermal cells; they resembled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) morphologically and expressed the main markers of MSCs. About half of all female offspring of mice implanted with embryos injected with hEMSCPCs at the blastocyst stage harbored the human Y chromosome and tissue-specific human protein, thereby demonstrating the transdifferentiation of hEMSCPCs.

84886288496	Multi-state coupling entropy of interactive dynamic process on scale-free network	The quantification of complexity is one of the most fundamental issues in the investigation of complex networks. In this paper, we propose multi-states entropy to quantify the complexity of a typical diffusion system, in which the interactive dynamics is characterized by a finite capacity effect. We show that the entropy strongly depend on the local topology and the finite capacity. Furthermore, based on the maximum entropy principle, we optimize the interaction of these two factors to achieve the most efficient interactive diffusion process on scale-free networks. © (2013)Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84890201370	Bearing performance degradation assessment based on Wavelet packet entropy and Gaussian mixture model	To assess an equipment's performance degradation accurately, wavelet packet entropy (WPE) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) were combined to evaluate the degradation state of bearing performance here. Firstly, WPEs as feature vectors were extracted from bearing vibration signals to describe a bearing running state. Secondly, the feature vectors under a normal state were used to construct a Gaussian mixture model as a baseline. Then, the GMM of every running state was established during tests, and the corresponding deviation value (DV) from the baseline model was calculated to evaluate if a degradation occurred and the degradation level of a bearing. Test results indicated that compared with the logistic regression-based degradation evaluation method, the proposed method can depict a bearing degradation process accurately in its full life cycle without its historical data and predefining the prior probability of each possible degradation state.

84888603124	Thermal short-circuiting and its influence on thermal response in borehole heat exchangers	The fluid extracts or rejects heat from subsurface by downward leg of pipe (DLP) and upward leg of pipe (ULP) in vertical borehole heat exchangers (BHEs). As the borehole diameter is only 0.11 m to 0.2 m, the temperature difference between DLP and ULP inevitably leads to thermal short-circuiting. In order to build accurate heat transfer model for the BHEs, the vertical underground heat exchangers with different boreholes, pipe diameters and arrangements were investigated numerically, and a best-fit correlation for the thermal short-circuiting resistance was presented in dimensionless form. A 3-D equivalent rectangular numerical model for BHEs was established and the influences of velocity and borehole depth on the short-circuiting loss rate were analyzed. Smaller velocity leads to larger thermal short-circuiting loss rate and lower average heat flux per unit length, but too large velocity has no obvious effect on reducing short-circuiting loss rate. The temperature difference between inlet and outlet increases with the borehole depth, while the heat transfer between DLP and ULP also increases greatly. The relationship between the thermal short-circuiting and the fluid temperature change is explored. The geometric mean fluid temperature ignoring the short-circuiting is always higher than the integral mean fluid temperature. With an in situ thermal conductivity test rig established in Nanjing, the results indicate that lower velocity results in lower effective subsurface conductivity and smaller heat transfer capacity in the BHEs. The measured subsurface thermal conductivity with 50 m borehole is 2.50 W · (m · K)

84892512404	Battlefield situation understanding based on fuzzy logic and CBR	To simulate battalions and regimental level battlefield combat, intelligent agent technique is often used to model troops on the battlefield. To enable agents to understand battlefield situation and perform basic tactics, there are great difficulties lie in the following aspects: the perception and understanding of battlefield information are often vague rather than precise; high-dimensional data of battlefield make domain rules hard to extract and knowledge base difficult to construct; huge amount of battlefield simulation data cause system delay. This paper presents a hybrid approach based on fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning, employs frame structure as case knowledge representation to simplify domain knowledge acquisition process. The introduction of Fuzzy Logic, in the case of properties matching process allows the Agent to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty of battlefield combat knowledge. The case study shows that the proposed hybrid approach combines both advantages of Fuzzy Logic and CBR, and its usability is plain to see. © 2013 IEEE.

84891743313	The rumor diffusion process with emerging independent spreaders in complex networks	Rumor diffusion on complex networks has been widely investigated assuming that an individual learns the rumor merely from its neighbors, which, however, is not always the case. Recent studies of layered models have shown that individuals belonging to many different networks can affect the spreading process on one network. In this paper, we take this phenomenon into consideration and discuss its influence on rumor diffusion in complex networks by introducing independent spreaders. Independent spreaders are nodes that know the rumor from other channels rather than their neighbors. A new stochastic technique is used to obtain the dynamics of rumor diffusion. Results reveal that independent spreaders boost the process by bringing the rumor to regions remote from current spreaders. In order to accelerate diffusion, we find that improving the network connectivity is more efficient than adding more independent spreaders. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84892823944	In-situ determination of the coefficient of thermal expansion of polysilicon thin films using micro-rotating structures	A simple method for in situ determination of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of polysilicon thin films by using micro-rotating structures is presented. The structures are heated electrically and deflect due to the thermal expansion. An analytical expression is derived to relate the CTE of the polysilicon thin film with the lateral displacement, geometrical parameters and the average temperature of the test structure. The lateral displacement is designed to be a constant value (2 μm), while the average temperature of the test structure can be obtained from the measurement of resistance of the test structure. Instead of an optical or visual readout, electrical input and electrical readout are utilized. In the experiments, a current-voltage measurement system only is required and all measurements can be carried out in atmosphere. Finite element analysis and experimental results with surface micromachined polysilicon thin films are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The average value of the obtained CTE is (2.76 ± 0.09) × 10

84892840234	Clustering high-dimensional data using multitask self-organizing map	Processing high-dimensional data is a problem in data analyzation. Due to its high-dimensional attributes and little samples, it is easy to encounter overfitting in processing high-dimensional data. Multitask learning, a weak learning, can boost prediction accuracy in all kinds of learning machines. Multitask learning doesn't need complex operations, but performs well. The characteristic of multitask learning is very fit in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-multitask self- organizing map. In multitask self-organizing map, we replace Euclidean distance between two nodes with their hellinger distance. Through experimenting on real data, multitask self-organizing map gets satisfactory results. Experiments prove multitask self-organizing map can perform well in high- dimensional data.

84892995124	Survival and migration of pre-induced adult human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in retinal degeneration slow (rds) mice three months after subretinal transplantation	Introduction: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited disease characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium, is a leading genetic cause of blindness. Cell transplantation to replace lost photoreceptors is a potential therapeutic strategy, but technical limitations have prevented clinical application. Adult human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) may be an ideal cell source for such therapies. This study examined the survival and migration of pre-induced hPBMCs three months after subretinal transplantation in the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mouse model of RP. Materials and Methods: Freshly isolated adult hPBMCs were pre-induced by co-culture with neonatal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat retinal tissue for 4 days in neural stem cell medium. Pre-induced cells were labeled with CM-DiI for tracing and injected into the right subretinal space of rds mice by the trans-scleral approach. After two and three months, right eyes were harvested and transplanted cell survival and migration examined in frozen sections and whole-mount retinas. Immunofluorescence in whole-mount retinas was used to detect the expression of human neuronal and photoreceptors protein markers by transplanted cells. Results: Pre-induced adult hPBMCs could survive in vivo and migrate to various parts of the retina. After two and three months, transplanted cells were observed in the ciliary body, retinal outer nuclear layer, inner nuclear layer, ganglion cell layer, optic papilla, and within the optic nerve. The neuronal and photoreceptor markers CD90/Thy1, MAP-2, nestin, and rhodopsin were expressed by subpopulations of CM-DiI-positive cells three months after subretinal transplantation. Conclusion: Pre-induced adult hPBMCs survived for at least three months after subretinal transplantation, migrated throughout the retina, and expressed human protein markers. These results suggest that hPBMCs could be used for cell replacement therapy to treat retinal degenerative diseases. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

84894174264	Individual behavior and social wealth in the spatial public goods game	Group interactions on structured populations can be represented by the public goods game on networks. During the evolutionary games, selective investment mechanism fosters social cooperative behavior. First we focus on star-like graphs to provide some light on why selective investment mechanism can promote collective cooperation. Then we implement public goods game with this mechanism on scale free networks to investigate behavior properties of individuals within different social environments. We indicate that high-degree nodes are predominantly inert owning largely to their satisfaction with their status, while low-degree nodes are very active due to their strive towards higher prosperity. Besides, we introduce the Gini coefficient to describe social inequality and find that large multiply factor r favors social fairness. Our work is applicable for community supervision and social wealth regulation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84894585889	Locality preserving projections based on feature space denoising and its application in bearing fault classification	The vibration signal measured in industrial applications is always contaminated by different noises, which leads to mistakes in fault diagnosis. Most of the de-noising algorithms deal with the time signal directly, which also are affected by computation time and memory space. The samples in feature space extracted from the original signal are more important than the time samples in fault diagnosis, which playing an important role in the application of manifold learning. A singular-value-based de-noising method is presented to denoise the feature samples, and then local preserving projection algorithm is used to reduce the feature dimension. Simulation and experiment results indicate that, comparing with de-noising the original time-domain signal, the proposed method can effectively speed up the computation process and decrease the memory space, while keeping the ability of dimension reduction and classification. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84895152295	Corneal lymphangiogenesis correlates closely with hemangiogenesis after keratoplasty	AIM: To examine the relationship between corneal lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis after keratoplasty. METHODS: Nineteen human corneas were obtained from 19 patients undergoing a second corneal transplantation in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center in 2005. Blood and lymphatic vessels in human transplanted corneas were identified by lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor (LYVE-1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion modecule-1 (PECAM-1) immunohistochemistry, and double enzyme-histochemistry; then the association of corneal blood vessel counting (BVC) with lymphatic vessel counting (LVC) was examined. RESULTS: Corneal hemangiogenesis was present in 12 cases (63%), and lymphangiogenesis occurred in 5 cases (26% ) human transplanted corneas. In addition, corneal lymphangiogenesis was only present in vascularized corneas. LVC was strongly and positively correlated with BVC(r =0.725, p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Corneal lymphangiogenesis develops after keratoplasty and strongly associates with hemangiogenesis.

84896080665	MUC4 modulates human glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion by upregulating EGFR expression	Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor, is the leading cause of deaths related to tumors in the central nervous system. The prognosis of GBM patients is currently poor, and the mechanisms underlying GBM genesis remain unclear. The expression of MUC4, a high-molecular-weight and highly glycosylated protein, has been studied in many cancers. However, information on MUC4 expression in GBM is limited. In this study, we found that MUC4 was overexpressed in GBM cell lines and tissues. The proliferation and invasive potential of GBM cells were significantly increased by the ectopic expression of MUC4. By contrast, RNA interference targeting MUC4 in GBM cells significantly decreased the proliferation and invasive potential of GBM cells. We also found that the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was modulated by MUC4. EGFR inhibition by siRNA reversed the MUC4-induced proliferation and invasion. These results indicated that MUC4 expression in GBM was important in GBM cell proliferation and invasion, which may be partly associated with EGFR overexpression. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and quantitative realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the protein and mRNA levels of biglycan in human normal endometrium, atypical hyperplasia endometrium, and endometrial cancer tissue samples. The expression of biglycan in serum and peritoneal washings was detected by ELISA method. Then we analyzed the correlation of biglycan expression with clinicopathological parameters in endometrial cancer. Results: (1) Biglycan was overexpressed in endometrial cancer, especially in cancerous mesenchyme. Moreover, biglycan expression was significantly correlated with histopathological grade and FIGO stage of endometrial cancer; (2) Biglycan expression level in sera and peritoneal washings was significantly higher in endometrial cancer patients; otherwise, Serum expression correlated with clinicopathological parameters of endometrial cancer; (3) Higher level expression of biglycan in cancerous mesenchyme correlated with poor prognosis of endometrial cancer. Conclusions: Biglycan might play a role in the progression of human endometrial cancer and it might be a useful molecular marker for the prognosis of endometrial cancer. This research is an initial step towards biglycan as a potential prognosis marker in endometrial cancer. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84903301570	Modeling the microstructure random fields of soft soil in the south of China	The behavior of soft soil is encoded at the granular scale. Hence, methods for multiple scales - from granular scale to field scale - are certainly needed to get a more accurate prediction of soil behavior. In the process of simulation, the material properties are also important. The inhomogeneities exist at different length-scales in geomechanical problems and greatly affect the mechanical behaviors of geo-material. In this paper, taking the soft soil in south of China as the research object, the soil microstructure random geometric model is established by using the Monte Carlo method. It is also implemented into the finite element method codes to perform the finite element analysis of the soft soil triaxial consolidation process. This probabilistic simulation approach is then compared with testing data. Numerical examples are presented to show how the performance of the geo-system is influenced by taking into account random fields. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84905233253	NEDD4 ubiquitinates TRAF3 to promote CD40-mediated AKT activation	CD40, a member of tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, has a pivotal role in B-cell-mediated immunity through various effector pathways including AKT kinase, but the signal transduction of CD40-meidated AKT activation is poorly understood. Here we report that the neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4 (NEDD4), homologous to E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus family E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a novel component of the CD40 signalling complex. It has a key role in CD40-mediated AKT activation and is involved in modulating immunoglobulin class switch through regulating the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase. NEDD4 constitutively interacts with CD40 and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of TNFR-associated factor3 (TRAF3). The ubiquitination of TRAF3 by NEDD4 is critical for CD40-mediated AKT activation. Thus, NEDD4 is a previously unknown component of the CD40 signalling complex necessary for AKT activation. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
