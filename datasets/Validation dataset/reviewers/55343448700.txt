84928349105	Two ultrastructural distribution patterns of immunoglobulin G in human placenta and functional implications	The placenta is known to protect the fetus from infection and maternal rejection. In a previous study, we demonstrated that placental trophoblasts can synthesize immunoglobulin G (IgG). In this study, we investigated the distribution of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA), IgG receptors (FcRn and FcgammaRIII), and complement proteins in placental trophoblasts at the ultrastructural level. In addition, we studied the mRNA expression of IgG1 heavy chain (IGHG1), recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) with nested RT-PCR in primary cultured trophoblasts. The mRNA transcripts of IGHG1, RAG1, RAG2, and AID were all identified in primary trophoblasts, further establishing the IgG-producing capacity of trophoblasts. At the ultrastructural level with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies, IgG was found to be distributed in two distinct locations in syncytiotrophoblasts. For one, it was colocalized with FcRn in endosome displaying low electron density, and for the other it was colocalized with complement C1q in medium-electron density irregular structures that have not been reported previously. This characteristic distribution suggests that IgG is likely processed through two molecular mechanisms in syncytiotrophoblasts: receptor-bound transportation across the syncytiotrophoblast and formation of immune complexes with locally produced IgG. The latter mechanism is probably aimed at neutralizing detrimental maternal anti-paternal major histocompatibility complex antibodies. Our findings support the hypothesis that placenta-produced IgG can selectively react with maternal anti-fetus antibodies and provide a mechanism of fetomaternal tolerance to protect the fetus from maternal immune rejection.

15844387274	Pathology and immunohistochemistry of thyroid in severe acute respiratory syndrome	Objective: To study the pathological characteristics of thyroid gland and the changes on hormone content of thyroid cells in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. Method: Hematoxylin and eosin staining and light microscopy were used to examine the histology of the thyroid tissues from 4 dead SARS patients and 5 healthy thyroid samples used as negative controls. Immunohistochemistry was used, with monoclonal antibodies, to detect the thyroglobulin (TG), calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the thyroid glands. Results: Deformation, enlargement, and dystrophy of follicular cells in thyroid glands were found in the SARS patients. The normal follicular epithelial cells were strongly TG positive, however, the number and intensity of TG positive follicular epithelial cells were significantly lower in the SARS patients. Calcitonin positive cells were found in the normal thyroid glands and not in the thyroid glands of the SARS patients. PTH positive cells were seen in the normal thyroid glands and those of the SARS patients with a slightly weaker intensity of reaction, however, with significant difference in IOD (P < 0.01) and without significant difference in mean slight absorption MOD (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The thyroid tissue structure and morphology in SARS patients were significantly changed, involving both follicular epithelial cells and parafollicular cells; which may imply that the hormonal production of follicular epithelial cells and the parafollicular cells were affected.

24644523552	Biosafety level 3 laboratory for autopsies of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: Principles, practices, and prospects	Background. During the outbreak of the emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection, >30% of the ∼8000 infected persons were health care workers. The highly infectious nature of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) compelled our pathologists to consider biosafety issues in the autopsy room and for tissue processing procedures. Methods. A specially designed biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy laboratory was constructed and divided into a clean area, a semicontaminated area, a contaminated area, and 2 buffer zones. High-efficiency particulate air filters were placed in the air supply and exhaust systems. Laminar air flow was from the clean areas to the less clean areas. The negative pressures of the contaminated, semicontaminated, and clean areas were approximately -50 pa, -25 pa, and -5 pa, respectively. Personal protective equipment, including gas mask, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves worn during autopsies; the equipment was decontaminated before it was allowed to exit the facility. Strict BSL-3 practices were followed. Results. When a given concentration of particulate sarin simulant was introduced into the contaminated area, it could not be detected in either the semicontaminated area or clean area, and particles >0.3 μm in size were not detected in the exhaust air. A total of 16 complete postmortem examinations for probable and suspected SARS were performed during a 2-month period. Of these, 7 reported confirmed cases of SARS. None of the 23 pathologists and technicians who participated in these autopsies was infected with SARS-CoV. Conclusions. Our experience suggests that BSL-3 laboratory operating principles should be among the special requirements for performing autopsies of contaminated bodies and that they can safeguard the clinicians and the environment involved in these procedures. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

23744439116	Multiple organ infection and the pathogenesis of SARS	After >8,000 infections and >700 deaths worldwide, the pathogenesis of the new infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), remains poorly understood. We investigated 18 autopsies of patients who had suspected SARS; 8 cases were confirmed as SARS. We evaluated white blood cells from 22 confirmed SARS patients at various stages of the disease. T lymphocyte counts in 65 confirmed and 35 misdiagnosed SARS cases also were analyzed retrospectively. SARS viral particles and genomic sequence were detected in a large number of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and lymphoid tissues, as well as in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, the mucosa of the intestine, the epithelium of the renal distal tubules, the neurons of the brain, and macrophages in different organs. SARS virus seemed to be capable of infecting multiple cell types in several organs; immune cells and pulmonary epithelium were identified as the main sites of injury. A comprehensive theory of pathogenesis is proposed for SARS with immune and lung damage as key features. JEM © The Rockefeller University Press.

31044449215	Orchitis: A complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has been known to damage multiple organs; however, little is known about its impact on the reproductive system. In the present study, we analyzed the pathological changes of testes from six patients who died of SARS. Results suggested that SARS caused orchitis. All SARS testes displayed widespread germ cell destruction, few or no spermatozoon in the seminiferous tubule, thickened basement membrane, and leukocyte infiltration. The numbers of CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages increased significantly in the interstitial tissue compared with the control group (P < 0.05). SARS viral genomic sequences were not detected in the testes by in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated abundant IgC precipitation in the seminiferous epithelium of SARS testes, indicating possible immune response as the cause for the damage. Our findings indicated that orchitis is a complication of SARS. It further suggests that the reproductive functions should be followed and evaluated in recovered male SARS patients. © 2006 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

33751541381	Primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the prostate (report of 1 case and review of the literatures)	Objective: To investigate the clinical features of primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the prostate. Methods: The clinical data of one case of primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the prostate were studied and the literatures were reviewed. Results: The needle biopsy of the prostate of the patient was proved to be signet ring cell carcinoma by pathological study. Immunohistochemical study showed that the carcinoma cell was positive for PSA, and negative for PAS, CEA, LCA and CKH. Bilateral orchiectomy and flutamide therapy were given to the patient. The patient died after one month because of lung metastasis after operation. Conclusion: Primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the prostate arises from the epithelium of the prostate acinus and its diagnosis depends on histopathologic study and immunohistochemistry. It is very rare with high malignancy and relatively poor prognosis.

33845631077	The spleen as a target in severe acute respiratory syndrome	It has been proposed that immune injury is the central mechanism of pathogenesis of the infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To gain a better understanding of immune injury in the spleen, we investigated the number and distribution of various immune cell types in the spleens of SARS patients. We performed autopsies on six confirmed SARS cases, with six normal subjects as controls; spleen samples from these autopsies were examined with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections, in situ hybridization for SARS virus genomic sequences, and immunohistochemistry with seven monoclonal antibodies to five cell types. The number and distribution of these cells were measured and analyzed using an image analysis system. SARS genomic sequences were detected in all SARS spleens. The SARS spleens all had severe damage to the white pulp and showed an alteration of the normal distribution of various cell types. Immunocytes in the red pulp were decreased by 68.0-90.7% except for CD68

33845322314	Pathology of the thyroid in severe acute respiratory syndrome	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic started in November 2002 and spread worldwide. The pathological changes in several human organs of patients with SARS have been extensively described. However, to date, little has been reported about the effects of this infection on the thyroid gland. Femoral head necrosis and low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels, commonly found in patients with SARS, raise the possibility of thyroid dysfunction. We have undertaken this study to evaluate for any potential injury to the thyroid gland caused by SARS on tissue samples obtained from 5 SARS autopsies. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end-labeling assay was performed to identify apoptotic cells. The follicular epithelium was found to be damaged with large numbers of cells exfoliated into the follicle. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end-labeling assay demonstrated many cells undergoing apoptosis. Follicular architecture was altered and showed distortion, dilatation, and collapse. No distinct calcitonin-positive cells were detectable in the SARS thyroids. In conclusion, both parafollicular and follicular cells were injured. This may provide an explanation both for low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels and the osteonecrosis of the femoral head associated with patients with SARS. Apoptosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS associated coronavirus infection in the thyroid gland. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33947531720	Molecular pathology in the lungs of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease with disastrous clinical consequences, in which the lungs are the major target organs. Previous studies have described the general pathology in the lungs of SARS patients and have identified some of the cell types infected by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, at the time of this writing, there were no comprehensive reports of the cellular distribution of the virus in lung tissue. In this study, we have performed double labeling combining in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry and alternating each of these techniques separately in consecutive sections to evaluate the viral distribution on various cell types in the lungs of seven patients affected with SARS. We found that SARS-CoV was present in bronchial epithelium, type I and II pneumocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages/monocytes. For pneumocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages, the infection rates were calculated. In addition, our present study is the first to demonstrate infection of endothelial cells and fibroblasts in SARS. Copyright © American Society for Investigative Pathology.

34548492482	Immunoglobulin G expression in carcinomas and cancer cell lines	The traditional view that immunoglobulin is produced only by differentiated B lymphocytes has been challenged as immunoglobulin genes have been found to be expressed in nonhematopoietic human cancer cells. However, this phenomenon has not been widely accepted, and knowledge about this newly discovered concept is limited. In this study, we investigated the IgG1 heavy chain (IGHG1) constant region gene and IgG protein expression in 6 cell lines, including epithelial cancer cells, and in tissues from 66 hyperplasias, adenomas, and carcinomas. We also studied the mechanism of IgG production in these cells by examining the expression of RAG1 (recombination activating gene 1), RAG2, and AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase). In cancer cell lines, mRNA of the IGHG1 constant region and Iγ-Cγ sterile transcript were detected by nested RT-PCR, and Ig γ and Ig κ proteins were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot. In surgically resected carcinoma tissues, we detected mRNA of the IGHG1 constant region by in situ hybridization, and by laser microdissection-assisted nested RT-PCR. Ig γ and Ig κ proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry. The V(D)J recombination of IgH and IgL loci, the Sγ1/2-Sμ switch circle, and the expression of RAG1 and RAG2 were also found in these cancer cell lines. These data suggest that cancer cells are capable of producing IgG. Because of its potential biological and clinical significance, this phenomenon warrants further investigation. © FASEB.

34648840650	H5N1 infection of the respiratory tract and beyond: a molecular pathology study	Background: Human infection with avian influenza H5N1 is an emerging infectious disease characterised by respiratory symptoms and a high fatality rate. Previous studies have shown that the human infection with avian influenza H5N1 could also target organs apart from the lungs. Methods: We studied post-mortem tissues of two adults (one man and one pregnant woman) infected with H5N1 influenza virus, and a fetus carried by the woman. In-situ hybridisation (with sense and antisense probes to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) and immunohistochemistry (with monoclonal antibodies to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) were done on selected tissues. Reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR, real-time RT-PCR, strand-specific RT-PCR, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) detection assays were also undertaken to detect viral RNA in organ tissue samples. Findings: We detected viral genomic sequences and antigens in type II epithelial cells of the lungs, ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea, T cells of the lymph node, neurons of the brain, and Hofbauer cells and cytotrophoblasts of the placenta. Viral genomic sequences (but no viral antigens) were detected in the intestinal mucosa. In the fetus, we found viral sequences and antigens in the lungs, circulating mononuclear cells, and macrophages of the liver. The presence of viral sequences in the organs and the fetus was also confirmed by RT-PCR, strand-specific RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and NASBA. Interpretation: In addition to the lungs, H5N1 influenza virus infects the trachea and disseminates to other organs including the brain. The virus could also be transmitted from mother to fetus across the placenta. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

36549012214	A feasibility study of virtual slides in surgical pathology in China	China's huge territorial expanse and its imbalance of regional economic development have resulted in an uneven distribution of experienced pathologists. Developing telepathology for consultation is of special relevance to China. We developed a newly designed telepathology workstation, which includes a small file size of each slide, permitting easy transmission, storage, and manipulation, and a feedback function, and also evaluated its feasibility in surgical pathology in China. Four hundred cases covering a broad spectrum of surgical pathology problems were investigated in a blinded fashion by the 2 pathologists using this virtual microscope system. These cases were then randomized and re-reviewed a second time with light microscope. Diagnoses and time spent for each diagnosis were recorded for both methods. The diagnostic accuracies achieved by viewing glass slides and virtual images were 97.25% (389 of 400) and 95.5% (382 of 400) for pathologist A and 96.25% (385 of 400) and 94.75% (379 of 400) for pathologist B, respectively. There was no significant diagnostic discrepancy between the 2 methods for the 2 pathologists. The average times for viewing a virtual slide were 3.41 and 5.24 minutes for pathologists A and B, respectively, whereas the average times for viewing a glass slide were 1.16 and 3.35 minutes for pathologists A and B. There was a statistical difference between the time costs of the 2 methods. However, the slight time increase using virtual slides is less than that using dynamic telepathology and traditional consultation, and is acceptable to the pathologists. These results showed that this newly designed virtual microscope system have an acceptable diagnostic accuracy that is of practical value and may be suitable for application in China. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

36248982150	Autophagy induced by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in Hela S3 cells involves inhibition of protein kinase B and up-regulation of Beclin 1	Histone deacetylase inhibitors are promising chemotherapeutic agents and some are in clinical trials. Several molecular mechanisms have been invoked to describe their effects on cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Autophagy has been observed in response to several anticancer reagents and has been demonstrated to be responsible for cell death. However, the exact mechanism of this phenomenon is still not clear. Here we demonstrated that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, induces nonapoptotic cell death with several specific features characteristic of autophagy in Hela S3 cells. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid inhibits the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin, a negative regulator of macroautophagy which induces the formation of autophagosomes in a Beclin 1- and autophagy-related 7-dependent manner. This process is mediated by Akt and tuberous sclerosis 2 as is demonstrated by inhibition by continuous active Akt plasmid transfection and RNA interference of tuberous sclerosis 2. Our data provide the first evidence that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid induces autophagy in Hela S3 cells through interference with the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. These findings suggest that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid may induce autophagic cancer cell death via its specific pathway, and invite further investigation into the detailed mechanism of this pathway to explore this compound's full potential as a chemotherapeutic agent. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: Randomized comparative controlled and open, clinical trial. Results: Altogether 128 patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy in the controlled group, 66 of who received cefoperazone/sulbactam and 62 cefotaxime. The patients, who were 18 to 65 years of age, were treated for respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and other moderate-to-severe nosocomial infections. For the cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefotaxime treatment groups, response rates were 95.45% and 88.71% among all the patients. The bacterial eradication rate for both treatment groups was 95.38% and 93.44% respectively. Both regimens were well tolerated, with 4.55% and 6.45% of patients respectively in the cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefotaxime treatment groups, experiencing adverse reactions. In the open group, the response rate was 92.31%. The bacteria eradication rate were 92.45% and the adverse reaction rate was 3.70%. Conclusion: Domestic cefoperazone/sulbactam is safe and effective in the treatment of moderate to severe bacterial infections including nosocomial infections.

38149080425	Assessment of diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of dynamic telepathology in China	To assess the feasibility, including diagnostic accuracy and time cost, of a real-time telepathology system with pathologic slides, 600 cases covering a wide spectrum of lesions from 16 organ systems were tested. The "correct" diagnosis (gold standard) was established as a consensus by 2 experienced pathologists. The cases were first examined by 4 pathologists at different levels of experience with dynamic telepathology. Cases were then reviewed by the same pathologists using light microscopy in a blinded fashion 3 weeks to 2 months later. A diagnosis, together with reading times for telepathology and light microscopy, was recorded for each case. Diagnostic accuracy by telepathology was 94.8% (569/600), 93.3% (560/600), 91.6% (550/600), and 97% (388/400) for pathologists A, B, C, and D, respectively. Telepathologic diagnosis was concordant with the gold standard and with direct microscopy, with a mean of 94.2% and 99.26%, respectively. Most cases (510 or 85%) were diagnosed in 15 to 40 minutes by telepathology, with a mean of 17.0 minutes. The time needed to review a slide by telepathology was 3 to 4 times longer than that of standard light microscopy. All 4 pathologists were able to render a diagnosis in all cases. Our results showed that robotic telepathology is sufficiently accurate for primary diagnosis in surgical pathology, but modifications in laboratory protocols, telepathology hardware, and internet speed are needed to reduce the time necessary for diagnosis by telepathology before this method may be deemed suitable for use in a busy practice. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

34247853383	Pathology and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors. It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease. Copyright © American Society for Investigative Pathology.

40949136212	Dynamic observation on the bladder acellular matrix grafts for substituting albuginea penis in rabbits	Background: At present, bladder acellular matrix grafts have been successfully used for substituting animal bladder and urinary canal, and for repairing hypospadia. However, reports on bladder acellular matrix grafts for substituting albuginea penis need to be investigated. Objective: Allogeneic bladder acellular grafts were used for substituting albuginea penis of rabbits, in order to observe repairing results. Design: A randomized controlled observation. Setting: West China Medical Laboratory Animal Center and West China Laboratory of Tissue Engineering of Sichuan University as well as Laboratory of Tissue Engineering of Guiyang Medical College. Materials: Fifty male healthy New Zealand Rabbits of grade 3, weighing 2.6-3.0 kg, without phimosis and penis dysplasia, and without presence of phallocampsis after normal saline being perfused, were provided by Huaxi Laboratory Animal Center of Sichuan University. Methods: This study was performed at the West China Laboratory Animal Center and West China Laboratory of Tissue Engineering of Sichuan University as well as Laboratory of Tissue Engineering of Guiyang Medical College between December 2005 and June 2007 Bladders were taken from 10 experimental rabbits for preparing bladder acellular matrix grafts. The other 40 New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into the control group, and the bladder acellular matrix grafts group, with 20 in each. An area of 10 mm×5 mm of albuginea penis was resected from dorsum penis of each rabbit. Suture in situ of albuginea penis and bladder acellular matrix grafting were conducted in rabbits of the control group and bladder acellular matrix grafts group, respectively. In the 2nd, 6th, 12th and 24th weeks postoperatively, each rabbit was intracavernously perfused normal saline for inducing penile erection, separately, in order to observe phallocampsis. At above-mentioned each time point, experimental animals were sacrificed. Sample was taken from surgical region for haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Masson trichrome staining, in order to observe the changes of tissue and structure of surgical region. Types I and III collagen fiber areas were detected by Stirus red staining, and the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS) and transforming growth factor- β 1 (TGF- β 1) were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Main outcome measures: 1 Phallocampsis status. 2 Changes of tissue and structure of surgical region. 3 iNOS and TGF- β 1 expressions. 4 Type I and III collagen fiber areas. Results: Forty experimental rabbits were involved in the penile surgery, two of them died from overdose anesthesia, two died from chordapsus, so the remaining thirty-six rabbits were involved in the final analysis. In the 6th week postoperatively, phallocampsis reached its highest level, and 2 rabbits in the control group and 1 rabbit in the bladder acellular matrix grafts group presented phallocampsis. In the 12th week, every rabbit presented phallocampsis. In the 24th week, 1 rabbit in the control group but none in the bladder acellular matrix grafts group presented phallocampsis. In the 2nd week, the structure of surgical regions of each rabbit was poorly clear, with remarkable inflammatory infiltration. In the bladder acellular matrix grafts group, grafting regions presented cells ingrowing the bladder acellular matrix grafts. Masson trichrome staining results showed that in the surgical region, tunica albuginea fibers were thin and poorly arranged. In the 6th week, tunica albuginea recovered its integrity, and bladder acellular matrix grafts could not be distinguished. No significant difference existed between two groups. In the 24th week, tunica albuginea was even and complete in the sugical region, and fibers restored their arrangement of circular muscle in inner layer and longitudinal muscle in outer layer, without difference from normal tunica albuginea. iNOS and TGF- β 1 expressions were the strongest in the 2nd week, and they were found in the fibrocytes and vascular endothelial cells in the 6th week, but a little in the 12th and 24th weeks postoperatively. There were no remarkable differences in iNOS and TGF- β 1 expressions between two groups at the same time point. In the 2nd week, types I and III collagen fibers co-existed with equivalent proportion. Then, type I collagen fibers were gradually increased, while type III collagen fibers were on the contrary. In the 24th week, type I collagen fibers took the main place and type III collagen fibers were unremarkable. Conclusion: Bladder acellular matrix grafts have no remarkable inflammatory reactions and fibrosis in repairing tunica albuginea of New Zealand rabbits, so they are very ideal grafting materials for penile surgery.

40449131540	Avian influenza receptor expression in H5N1-infected and noninfected human tissues	Avian and human influenza viruses preferentially bind to α-2,3-linked and α-2,6-linked sialic acids, respectively. Until today, the distributions of these two receptor types had never been investigated in H5N1-infected human tissue samples. Here, the expression of avian (AIV-Rs) and human influenza receptors (HuIV-Rs) is studied in various organs (upper and lower respiratory tracts, brain, placenta, liver, kidney, heart, intestines, and spleen) of two H5N1 cases and 14 control cases. Histochemical stains using biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin II and Sambucus nigra agglutinin were performed to localize AIV-Rs and HuIV-Rs, respectively. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed to identify the receptor-bearing cells. AIV-Rs were detected on type II pneumocytes; a limited number of epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract; and the bronchi, bronchioli, and trachea; as well as on Kupffer cells, glomerular cells, splenic T cells, and neurons in the brain and intestines. HuIV-Rs were abundantly present in the respiratory tract and lungs. They were also detected on Hofbauer cells, glomerular cells, splenic B cells, and in the liver. Moreover, endothelial cells of all organs examined expressed both receptor types. In conclusion, the distribution pattern of AIV-Rs is partially inconsistent with the pattern of infected cells as detected in previous studies, which suggests there may be other receptors or mechanisms involved in H5N1 infection. In addition, the diffuse presence of receptors on endothelial cells may account for the multiple organ involvement in H5N1 influenza. Finally, the relative lack of AIV-Rs in the upper airway may be a one of the factors preventing efficient humanto-human transmission of H5N1 influenza. © FASEB.

40749128889	Pathogenetic mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease with significant morbidity and mortality. While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main SARS-CoV receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In this review, we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross, cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS. The implications of the proposed pathogenesis for prevention, diagnosis and therapy of the disease are discussed. © 2007.

84867318039	Clinical analysis of 21 cases of multiple primary cancers associated with bladder cancer in elderly patients	Objective: To investigate the clinical features of multiple primary cancers (MPC) associated with bladder cancer in elderly patients. Methods: The records of 21 elderly patients with MPC associated with bladder cancer treated in our hospital from August 1997 to August 2011 were reviewed. Results: Out of 1,415 bladder cancer patients treated contemporarily, 21 (1.48%) were diagnosed with MPC associated with bladder cancer through biopsy. The overall survival rate of elderly patients with this condition was 76.2%. Six patients suffered from MPC associated with bladder cancer in the first seven years. Fifteen patients suffered from this disease in the next seven years. A total of 9 of the 21 elderly patients with MPC associated with bladder cancer suffered from other neoplasms involving the urinary system, including 5 in the digestive system, 3 in the respiratory system, 2 in the genital system, and 2 in other systems. In addition, 9 elderly patients were confirmed of having synchronous MPC associated with bladder cancer: 4 died, and 5 survived after 48 months follow-up. The other 12 patients suffered from metachronous MPC associated with bladder cancer: 1 elderly patient died, and the remaining 11 were followed up for 53 to 144 months after treatment for the first carcinoma. The cumulative survival rates of the elderly patients with synchronous and metachronous MPC associated with bladder cancer were significantly different. Therefore, the tumor staging of MPC associated with bladder cancer in elderly patients is closely associated with the survival rates. Conclusion: The incidence of MPC associated with bladder cancer in elderly patients is increasing. The other neoplasms of this disease in elderly patients are frequently found in the urinary, digestive, and respiratory systems. The cumulative survival rate in elderly patients with metachronous MPC associated with bladder cancer is higher than that of the synchronous type. The high tumor staging of this disease in elderly patients is closely associated with the low survival rates. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of malignant neoplasms may be the only approach to achieving long-term survival.

84867052187	Human Surfactant Protein A2 Gene Mutations Impair Dimmer/Trimer Assembly Leading to Deficiency in Protein Sialylation and Secretion	Surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2) plays an essential role in surfactant metabolism and lung host defense. SP-A2 mutations in the carbohydrate recognition domain have been related to familial pulmonary fibrosis and can lead to a recombinant protein secretion deficiency in vitro. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of protein secretion deficiency and the subsequent biological effects in CHO-K1 cells expressing both wild-type and several different mutant forms of SP-A2. We demonstrate that the SP-A2 G231V and F198S mutants impair the formation of dimmer/trimer SP-A2 which contributes to the protein secretion defect. A deficiency in sialylation, but not N-linked glycosylation, is critical to the observed dimmer/trimer impairment-induced secretion defect. Furthermore, both mutant forms accumulate in the ER and form NP-40-insoluble aggregates. In addition, the soluble mutant SP-A2 could be partially degraded through the proteasome pathway but not the lysosome or autophagy pathway. Intriguingly, 4-phenylbutyrate acid (4-PBA), a chemical chaperone, alleviates aggregate formation and partially rescued the protein secretion of SP-A2 mutants. In conclusion, SP-A2 G231V and F198S mutants impair the dimmer/trimer assembly, which contributes to the protein sialylation and secretion deficiency. The intracellular protein mutants could be partially degraded through the proteasome pathway and also formed aggregates. The treatment of the cells with 4-PBA resulted in reduced aggregation and rescued the secretion of mutant SP-A2. © 2012 Song et al.

84876696485	Up-regulation of immunoglobulin G gene expression in the hippocampus of rats subjected to acute immobilization stress	Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is thought to be produced by matured B lymphocytes, however, it was recently found to be synthesized in neurons of the brain, especially showing higher expression level in the hippocampus. To study the possible effects of IgG in the hippocampus, we examined IgG protein and mRNA expressions in rat hippocampal neurons with immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization and laser microdissection-assisted RT-PCR. Increased IgG expressions at both protein and mRNA levels were detected in the hippocampus of an acute immobilization stress model of rat. No change was observed in the cortex or the thalamus. Furthermore, the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and β III tubulin proteins did not show significant changes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that hippocampal IgG may play a key role in adverse circumstances such as stress. The finding of increased IgG expression in the hippocampus following stress may also provide possibilities for developing antidepressant medication. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84908495358	Expression and distribution of immunoglobulin G in the normal liver, hepatocarcinoma and postpartial hepatectomy liver	The liver has the extraordinary properties of regeneration and immune tolerance; however, the mechanisms governing these abilities are poorly understood. To address these questions, we examined the possible expression of immunoglobulins in the human and rat liver and the relationship of IgG expression to hepatocyte proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis and immune tolerance. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser-guided microdissection and reverse transcription-PCR were performed to examine the expression of IgG in normal human and rat liver, severe combined immunodeficient mouse (SCID) liver and human liver cancers and corresponding cell lines. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into cultured hepatocarcinoma cells to downregulate the expression of IgG heavy chain genes. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assayed with flow cytometry. Cell metastasis was assayed with a Transwell cell assay. Partial hepatectomy (70%) was performed in rats to examine the relationship between hepatocyte IgG and hepatocyte proliferation. IgG, together with essential enzymes for its synthesis, were expressed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes of normal adult human and hepatoma patients and rat livers, SCID mouse liver and BRL-3A, L-02 and HepG-2 cell lines. Downregulation of IgG inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis and promoted apoptosis. Postsurgery livers expressed significantly more IgG than the livers before surgery and decreased to the original levels when hepatocytes stopped regeneration. IgA and IgM but not IgD and IgE were also positive in hepatocytes. Our findings demonstrate that normal and malignant hepatocytes are capable of synthesizing immunoglobulin, which has important roles in hepatocyte proliferation, apoptosis and cancer growth with profound clinical implications.

43449131547	Pathology, molecular biology, and pathogenesis of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans	H5N1 avian influenza is a highly fatal infectious disease that could cause a potentially devastating pandemic if the H5N1 virus mutates into a form that spreads efficiently among humans. Recent findings have led to a basic understanding of cell and organ histopathology caused by the H5N1 virus. Here we review the pathology of H5N1 avian influenza reported in postmortem and clinical studies and discuss the key pathogenetic mechanisms. Specifically, the virus infects isolated pulmonary epithelial cells and causes diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhage in the lungs of infected patients. In addition, the virus may infect other organs, including the trachea, the intestines, and the brain, and it may penetrate the placental barrier and infect the fetus. Dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines is likely to be one of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza. We also review the various molecular determinants of increased pathogenicity that have been identified in recent years and the role of avian and human influenza virus receptors in relation to the transmissibility of the H5N1 virus. A comprehensive appreciation of H5N1 influenza pathogenetic mechanisms should aid in the design of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this emerging disease.

45749147363	Bladder acellular matrix grafts for reconstructing tunica albuginea in rabbits	Background: Penile curvature can be corrected with the materials to substitute the tunica albuginea defect or enlarge the affected tunica albuginea. At present, no ideal substitute material has been found, so the scholars overseas consider reconstructing tunica albuginea with the acellular extracellular matrix. Objective: To conduct a dynamic observation of the reconstruction of tunica albuginea in New Zealand rabbits with bladder acellular matrix grafts. Design, time and setting: From December 2005 to June 2007, a randomized controlled animal experiment was carried out in the West China Experimental Animal Center and the Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Sichuan University, as well as the Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Guiyang Medical College. Materials: Fifty New Zealand male rabbits were adopted, weighing 2.6-3.0 kg, and 10 of them were used for the preparation of bladder acellular grafts. Methods: The other 40 rabbits were at random divided into control group and bladder acellular matrix graft group, with 20 animals in each group. A defect area of 10 mm × 5 mm was induced in those rabbits, and repaired with orthotopic suture of tunica albuginea or bladder acellular matrix grafts, respectively. Main outcome measures: At postoperative weeks 2, 6, 12 and 24, an penile erection was induced by a rapid intracavernosal injection with saline into 5 rabbits at each time point, to observe penile curvature; Then rabbits were sacrificed, followed by hematoxylin-eosin, Masson and sirius red stain. Protein expression of the inflammatory markers inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was evaluated; Image collection system was used to measure the area of collagen fiber. Results: The incidence of penile deviation was the highest at 6 weeks and then reduced gradually, and only 1 case of slight penile deviation was observed in control group at 24 weeks. Collagen I and III occupied equally the grafting site 2 weeks postoperatively; After that, the collage I increased evidently (P < 0.05) and collagen III decreased gradually (P < 0.05). Collagen I occupied mostly the grafting site at 24 weeks, while collagen III was not observed. Expression of iNOS and TGF-β1 was the highest at 2 weeks and precipitously decreased at 6 weeks. Conclusion: The bladder acellular matrix grafts demonstrate good histocompatibility in the repair of tunica albuginea in New Zealand rabbits, does not stimulate significant inflammatory response or cause fibrosis, so it is an ideal material for the tunica albuginea repair.

46149103368	Expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in ganglion cells of the hearts	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as an important chloride-selective channel is known to distribute on the apical membrane of chloride-secreting epithelial cells. However, CFTR is also reported to express in the neurons of human and rat brain. In this study we aim to investigate the expression of CFTR in ganglion cells of the hearts. We used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser microdissection (LMD) and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR) to detect CFTR in the ganglion cells of the Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and found widespread and abundant the expression of CFTR protein and its mRNA in the ganglion cells of the rat hearts. The presence of CFTR in ganglia does not only provide a possible explanation for cardiovascular symptoms of cystic fibrosis patients but also may lead to a better understanding of a possible role for CFTR in the neuronal regulation of the heart. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

55249114177	Distinctly different expression of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of two H5N1 avian influenza patients	The pathogenesis of human H5N1 influenza remains poorly understood and controversial. 'Cytokine storm' has been hypothesized to be the main cause of the severity of this disease. However, the significance of this hypothesis has been called into question by a recent report, which demonstrates that inhibition of the cytokine response did not protect against lethal H5N1 influenza infection in mice. Here we showed discrepant findings in two adult H5N1 autopsies and a fetus obtained at autopsy which also raise doubt about this hypothesis. Antigens of 10 cytokines/chemokines which were found to be significantly elevated in previous H5N1-infected patients and in vitro experiments, and mRNA of eight of these, were absent from the lungs of a pregnant woman and her fetus. In contrast, antigens of seven cytokines/chemokines and mRNA of six of these were found to be increased in the lungs of a male autopsy. The cells expressing these cytokines and chemokines were identified as type II pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages and vascular endothelial cells. Levels of cytokines and chemokines in the serum of the male case were also significantly higher than those of infectious (infection other than by H5N1) and non-infectious controls. In comparison with results from our previous study, it appeared that the male case had increased cytokine/chemokine expression but reduced viral load, while the pregnant female had diminished cytokine/chemokine expression but a significantly increased viral load in the lungs. These disparate findings in these two cases suggest that 'cytokine storm' alone could not be a sufficient explanation for the severe lung injury of this newly emerging disease.

65349144223	Immunoglobulin expression in non-lymphoid lineage and neoplastic cells	It has traditionally been believed that the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules is restricted to B lineage cells. However, immunoglobulin genes and proteins have been recently found in a variety of types of cancer cells, as well as some proliferating epithelial cells and neurons. The immunoglobulin molecules expressed by these cells consist predominantly of IgG, IgM, and IgA, and the light chains expressed are mainly kappa chains. Recombination activating genes 1 and 2, which are required for V(D)J recombination, are also expressed in these cells. Knowledge about the function of these non-lymphoid cell-derived immunoglobulins is limited. Preliminary data suggests that Ig secreted by epithelial cancer cells has some unidentified capacity to promote the growth and survival of tumor cells. As immunoglobu- lins are known to have a wide spectrum of important functions, the discovery of non-lymphoid cells and cancers that produce immunoglobulin calls for in-depth investigation of the functional and pathological significance of this previously unrecognized phenomenon.

66549102860	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator expression in human spinal and sympathetic ganglia	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel protein, and mutations of its gene cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR is known to be expressed in epithelial cells of the respiratory, digestive and reproductive tracts. It is also present in rat neurons and heart ganglion cells. In humans, it is expressed in the hypothalamus, but has not been identified in other parts of the human nervous system. In this study, immunohistochemistry, double-staining immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, nested reverse transcription-PCR and relative quantification of real-time PCR analysis were performed on spinal and sympathetic ganglia from seven human autopsies with no known nervous system disease. CFTR protein was expressed in most ganglion cells with no obvious difference in the amounts of mRNA transcript in ganglia of different sites. We conclude that CFTR protein and its mRNA were extensively expressed at relatively constant levels in human spinal and sympathetic ganglion cells, and may be important in physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, CFTR in ganglia may be associated with pathophysiological changes seen in cystic fibrosis. © 2009 USCAP, Inc. All rights reserved.

70350218883	Quantitative morphometry by image analysis of normal, hyperplastic and cancerous ductal breasts	OBJECTIVE: To analyze a number of quantitative variables in ductal epithelial breast proliferations and test them against diagnoses established by standard histologic and cytologic criteria in order to determine which variables are useful in discriminating between histologic diagnoses. STUDY DESIGN: A method was developed for the semiautomatic segmentation and quantitative analysis of breast ductal proliferations using image analysis. This permitted duct profiles and intraductal epithelial proliferations to be analyzed by computer, with calculation of a total of 17 variables-for example, nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear circularity, average internuclear distance and lumen area. Four groups were analyzed employing a total of 80 cases with diagnoses established by standard histologic criteria, including normal breast duct (DN = 19 cases), ductal hyperplasia without atypia (DH = 21 cases), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS = 20 cases) and invasive ductal carcinoma (INV = 20 cases). RESULTS: Of the 17 quantitative variables tested in this study, 15 showed statistically significant differences in values between DH and DCIS (p<0.05), and 7 showed statistically significant differences between DN and DH (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: By quantitative morphometric analysis of selected variables, a significant statistical distinction can be made between diagnostic groups, paving the way for automatic computerized image recognition for differential diagnosis. © Science Printers and Publishers, Inc.

71249154394	Expression and distribution of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in neurons of the spinal cord	To verify the hypothesis that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in neurons of the human spinal cord, we investigated the presence and distribution of CFTR protein and mRNA in different segments of the human spinal cord obtained from autopsies. The techniques employed included reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect CFTR gene expression, in situ hybridization to detect mRNA distribution, and immuno-histochemistry to detect protein distribution. The specificity of these experiments was established with extensive controls. We found widespread and abundant expression of CFTR in neurons of the human spinal cord. CFTR protein and mRNA are localized to the cytoplasm of neurons in all segments of the spinal cord but not to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells. CFTR is a very important molecule, acting as a chloride channel and regulating many physiological functions, including salt transport, fluid flow, and intracellular ion concentrations. Its mutation causes cystic fibrosis. Our finding of abundant CFTR in the spinal cord suggests that this molecule may be significant in the normal function and pathology of the spinal cord. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

73349116622	Expression and distribution of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in neurons of the human brain	The importance of the molecule cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is reflected in the many physiological functions it regulates. It is known to be present in epithelial cells of the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, gut, and other tissues, and gene mutations of CFTR cause cystic fibrosis (CF). We studied the expression and distribution of CFTR in the human brain with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. This study demonstrates widespread and abundant expression of CFTR in neurons of the human brain. Techniques of double labeling and evaluation of consecutive tissue sections localized CFTR protein and mRNA signals to the cytoplasm of neurons in all regions of the brain studied, but not to glial cells. The presence of CFTR in central neurons not only provides a possible explanation for the neural symptoms observed in CF patients, but also may lead to a better understanding of the functions of CFTR in the human brain.

77950974012	Immunoglobulin G is present in a wide variety of soft tissue tumors and correlates well with proliferation markers and tumor grades	BACKGROUND: The traditional view that immunoglobulin (Ig) is produced only by B lymphocytes has been challenged, because it has been demonstrated that Ig genes and proteins are expressed in epithelial cancer cells. However, whether Ig expression in nonlymphoid cells is limited to epithelial cells is unclear. Because sarcomas differ distinctly from carcinomas in their biologic and clinical features, the authors investigated the question of nonlymphoid IgG expression in soft tissue lesions. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to demonstrate IgG expression in 80 soft tissue lesions. The correlation between Ig expression and proliferation markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], Ki-67, and cyclin D1) in sarcomas was investigated by immunohistochemical and statistical analyses. RESULTS: Igj was identified in 97.4% of sarcomas and in 31.7% of benign lesions by immunohistochemistry. The difference was statistically significant (P < .01). Messenger RNA from the IgG1 heavy-chain constant region was also detected by in situ hybridization. Variable-diversity-joining recombination sequences of both heavy and light chains were obtained by PCR and sequencing. Moreover, the labeling index of PCNA, Ki-67, and cyclin D1 was much higher in sarcomas with high Igj expression than in sarcomas with low Igj expression (P < .01 for PCNA and cyclin D1; P < .001 for Ki-67). There were more grade 3 sarcomas with high Igj expression compared with grade 1 and 2 sarcomas (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: IgG was identified in a wide variety of soft tissue tumors and correlated well with proliferation markers and tumor grades. IgG may be a useful marker for cell proliferation in sarcomas. © 2010 American Cancer Society.

77951661008	Bladder carcinosarcoma (report of 3 cases)	Objective: To evaluate the clinical and pathological features of bladder carcinosarcoma and its diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The clinical data from 3 patients with bladder carcinosarcoma treated from January 2002 to September 2006 were analyzed and the related literatures were reviewed. Results: The 3 cases were all male and the age was 60, 36 and 13 years old, respectively. The most common symptoms were painless gross hematuria or pollakisuria. B-ultrasound or CT showed masses of the bladder. Cystoscopy showed bladder tumor in 1 patient. Partial resection was performed in 2 patients. Radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection were performed in 1 patient. Chemotherapy was given to 2 patients after surgery. Pathological examination revealed that the tumors were composed of epithelium and mesenchyme and were diagnosed as bladder carcinosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry showed positive expression of Myo and negative expression of CK, LCA, CD20, CD45Ro, NSE, CgA, Syn, Vim and Des in tumor tissues of 1 patient and positive expression of Vim, CD68 and CK and negative expression of Des, Actin, S-100, MyoDl, Myogenin and SMA in another patient's tumor tissues. One patient died of lung and liver metastasis 30 months after surgery, another died of lung metastasis 8 months after surgery and the other one was failed to be followed-up. Conclusion: Bladder carcinosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor, with high malignancy, strong ability to infiltrate, rapid progression and poor prognosis. The diagnosis depends on pathology and immunohistochemistry. Early radical cystectomy is the best treatment.

77954899273	Expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in paracervical ganglia	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important protein that acts as a chloride channel and regulates many physiological functions, including salt transport and fluid flow. Mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR protein cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells of the lungs, pancreas, intestines, and other organs. In the peripheral and central nervous system, CFTR expression has been detected in the neurons of rat brains, ganglion cells of rat hearts, human hypothalamus, human spinal cord, and human spinal and sympathetic ganglia. However, CFTR has not been identified in other parts of the nervous system. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and laser-assisted microdissection (LMD) followed by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR to identify CFTR proteins and messenger RNA in human and rat paracervical ganglion cells. CFTR and its gene expression were both detected in paracervical ganglion cells, a finding that might link this important protein to the neuronal regulation of female urogenital function. These findings could provide new insights into the symptoms related to the reproductive system frequently observed in female cystic fibrosis patients.

77954912475	Pandemic influenza a (H1N1) virus infection and avian influenza a (H5N1) virus infection: A comparative analysis	The 2009 H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses are newly (re-) emerged influenza A viruses (2009 A(H1N1) and A(H5N1), respectively) that have recently posed tremendous health threats in many regions worldwide. With the 2009 out break of H1N1 influenza A, the world witnessed the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. The disease has rapidly spread across the entire globe, and has resulted in hundreds of thousands of cases with confirmed infection. Although characterized by high transmissibility, the virulence and fatality of the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus have thus far remained relatively low. The reverse holds true for A(H5N1) influenza; at a fatality rate that exceeds 60%, it is known to cause severe damage to the human respiratory system, but is not presently capable of efficient transmission from human to human. Apart from the clear differences between the two types of influenza, there are some significant similarities that warrant attention. In particular, the more severe and fatal 2009 A(H1N1) influenza cases have shown symptoms similar to those reported in cases of A(H5N1) influenza. Histopathological findings for these cases, to the extent available, also appear to have similarities for both diseases in terms of damage and severity. Here we review important recent publications in this area, and we discuss some of the key commonalities and contrasts between the two influenza A types in terms of their biology, origins, clinical features, pathology and pathogenesis, and receptors and transmissibility.

79952101057	Expression and distribution of immunoglobulin G and its receptors in the human nervous system	Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that several immunological molecules previously thought to be exclusively expressed by immune cells are also produced by nervous cells. Such molecules are thought to participate in the cross-talk between the immune and the nervous systems. IgG, an important immunological molecule, was traditionally thought to be produced by B lymphocytes only. In this study, extensive expression of neuron-derived IgG was detected throughout the nervous system. Relative quantification indicated that IgG was produced by neural cells at a low constant level. Transcripts of rearranged V-(D)-J segments and recombination activating genes-1 and -2 were also detected. Various IgG receptor types were also detected with distinct distribution patterns at different parts of the central and the peripheral nervous system. Given the widespread expression of IgG and its receptors, IgG most likely has an important biological function in the nervous system and might be classified as an immune mediator involved in neuro-immune crosstalk. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

79958811590	Immunoglobulin G (IGG) expression in human umbilical cord endothelial cells	Traditional views hold that immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the human umbilical cord is internalized by human umbilical endothelial cells for passive immunity. In this study, the protein and mRNA transcripts of IgG were found in the cytoplasm of human umbilical endothelial cells by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR). The essential enzymes for IgG synthesis and assembling, RAG1 (recombination activating gene 1), RAG2, and variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments for recombination of IgG, were also found in these cells by RT-PCR and realtime PCR. These results indicate that umbilical endothelial cells are capable of synthesizing IgG with properties similar to those of immune cells and that they may play additional roles besides lining the vessels and transporting IgG. © The Author(s) 2011.

79957807804	Transcription factors E2A, FOXO1 and FOXP1 regulate recombination activating gene expression in cancer cells	It has long been accepted that immunoglobulins (Igs) were produced by B lymphoid cells only. Recently Igs have been found to be expressed in various human cancer cells and promote tumor growth. Recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2, which are essential enzymes for initiating variable-diversity-joining segment recombination, have also been found to be expressed in cancer cells. However, the mechanism of RAG activation in these cancer cells has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of RAG expression in four human cancer cell lines by analyzing transcription factors that induce RAG activation in B cells. By RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence, we found that transcription factors E2A, FOXO1 and FOXP1 were expressed and localized to the nuclei of these cancer cells. Over-expression of E2A, FOXO1 or Foxp1 increased RAG expression, while RNA interference of E2A, FOXO1 or FOXP1 decreased RAG expression in the cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed acetylation of RAG enhancer (Erag) and E2A, FOXO1 or FOXP1 were bound to Erag in vivo. These results indicate that in these cancer cells the transcription factors E2A, FOXO1 and FOXP1 regulate RAG expression, which initiates Ig gene rearrangement much in the way similar to B lymphocytes. © 2011 Chen et al.

79959546322	Immunoglobulin G locus events in soft tissue sarcoma cell lines	Recently immunoglobulins (Igs) have been found to be expressed by cells other than B lymphocytes, including various human carcinoma cells. Sarcomas are derived from mesenchyme, and the knowledge about the occurrence of Ig production in sarcoma cells is very limited. Here we investigated the phenomenon of immunoglobulin G (IgG) expression and its molecular basis in 3 sarcoma cell lines. The mRNA transcripts of IgG heavy chain and kappa light chain were detected by RT-PCR. In addition, the expression of IgG proteins was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Immuno-electron microscopy localized IgG to the cell membrane and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The essential enzymes required for gene rearrangement and class switch recombination, and IgG germ-line transcripts were also identified in these sarcoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrated histone H3 acetylation of both the recombination activating gene and Ig heavy chain regulatory elements. Collectively, these results confirmed IgG expression in sarcoma cells, the mechanism of which is very similar to that regulating IgG expression in B lymphocytes. © 2011 Chen et al.

79960941984	Expression and distribution of immunoglobulin G and its receptors in an immune privileged site: The eye	It has recently been demonstrated that not only mature B lymphocytes, but also non-lymphoid cells, including cancer cells and neurons, express IgG. In the eye, an important immune privileged site, the presence of IgG has been ascribed to IgG entering the eye through breaches of the blood-ocular barrier. Here we demonstrate that the eye itself can produce IgG intrinsically. Applying immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR, several intraocular structures were found to express proteins and mRNA transcripts of IgG heavy chains, light chains, V(D)J rearrangements, and enzymes required for V(D)J recombination. IgG receptors were also detected in the intraocular epithelium and endothelium. The extensive distribution of IgG and its receptors in intraocular structures indicates that locally produced IgG could play a significant role in maintaining the ocular microenvironment and protection of the eyes, and it might also be involved in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration and some inflammatory diseases. © Springer Basel AG 2010.

80053418853	Effect of endemic fluoride poisoning caused by coal burning on the oxidative stress in rat testis	Objective: To explore the effect of endemic fluoride poisoning caused by coal burning on the oxidative stress in rat testis. Methods: Totally 40 male SD rats were equally randomized into four groups: control group, low fluororsis group, middle fluororsis group, and high fluorosis group. Rats in all three fluororsis groups were fed with corn dried by burning coal obtained from endemic fluorosis areas with high fluoride, and thus the animal models of fluorosis were established. After 120 and 180 days, all the rats were sacrificed. Testis tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and observed under light microscope. The malonaldehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total nitric oxide synthase (T-NOS), and iducible nitric oxidase synthase (iNOS) were measured by biochemical methods in the testis tissues. The content of NaF in testis was measured by fluorine selective electrode. Results: The rat fluororsis models were successfully established. The fluoride content in testis was significantly increased in all the fluororsis groups (P < 0.01). Testicular structures were damaged in all of fluoride groups. The T-NOS, iNOS activities, and MDA content of each fluoride group were significantly higher than that of the control group on day 120 and 180 (P < 0.05 or 0.01). The T-NOS, iNOS activities, and MDA content significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 or 0.01). The SOD activities significantly decreased in all the fluoride groups (P < 0.05 or 0.01). Conclusions: Endemic fluoride poisoning caused by coal burning can cause disorders in the oxidative system and anti-oxidative system in rat testis. The oxidative stress may play an important role in the fluorides-induced reproductive toxicity in male rats.

84855358671	Immunoglobulin G expression and its colocalization with complement proteins in papillary thyroid cancer	Except for the well-known immunoglobulin G (IgG) producing cell types, ie, mature B lymphocytes and plasma cells, various non-lymphoid cell types, including human cancer cells, neurons, and some specified epithelial cells, have been found to express IgG. In this study, we detected the expression of the heavy chain of IgG (IgGγ) and kappa light chain (Igκ) in papillary thyroid cancer cells. Using in situ hybridization, we detected the constant region of human IgG1 (IGHG1) in papillary thyroid cancer cells. With laser capture microdissection followed by RT-PCR, mRNA transcripts of IGHG1, Ig, recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase genes were successfully amplified from isolated papillary thyroid cancer cells. We further confirmed IgG protein expression with immunohistochemistry and found that none of the IgG receptors was expressed in papillary thyroid cancer. Differences in the level of IgGγ expression between tumor size, between papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid tissue, as well as between papillary thyroid cancer with and without lymph node metastasis were significant. Taken together, these results indicate that IgG is produced by papillary thyroid cancer cells and that it might be positively related to the growth and metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that IgGγ colocalized with complement proteins in the same cancer cells, which could indicate that immune complexes were formed. Such immune complexes might consist of IgG synthesized by the host against tumor surface antigens and locally produced anti-idiotypic IgG with specificity for the variable region of these 'primary' antibodies. The cancer cells might thus escape the host tumor-antigen-specific immune responses, hence promoting tumor progression. © 2012 USCAP, Inc. All rights reserved.

84857036232	Expression of immunoglobulin G in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and its association with tumor grade and Ki67	We and other research groups have previously shown that various cancer types can express immunoglobulin G, but investigation on of immunoglobulin G expression in esophageal cancer, a highly malignant tumor, and its biological significance has been lacking. In this study, we examined immunoglobulin G protein and its messenger RNA, as well as the expressions of recombination-activating gene 1, recombination-activating gene 2, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase in 142 cases of esophageal cancer tissues, and 2 esophageal cancer cell lines (Eca109, SHEEC). We also compared their expressions with tumor grade and a proliferation marker, Ki67. We used immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, laser microdissection coupled with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. We detected transcripts of immunoglobulin G 1 heavy-chain constant region, immunoglobulin-κ and λ-light chains, immunoglobulin G variable region, and recombination-activating genes 1 and 2 in both esophageal cancer tissues and cell lines, whereas activation-induced cytidine deaminase was not detected. No immunoglobulin G receptor subtypes were detected. Statistic analysis revealed that immunoglobulin G expression correlated well with tumor grades (P <.001) and with the proliferation marker Ki67 (P <.001). Our results indicate that human esophageal cancer cells are capable of synthesizing immunoglobulin G, which is likely involved in the growth and proliferation of this highly malignant cancer and might also be used as a prognostic indicator in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84858746880	IgG gene expression and its possible significance in prostate cancers	BACKGROUND In spite of recent advances in treatment strategies, prostate cancer (PCa) remains the second leading cause of cancer death in men with its genetic and biologic behaviors still poorly understood. Recently, accumulating evidence indicates that cancer cells, as well as some normal cells can secret IgG. This study was designed to evaluate IgG gene expression and its possible significance in PCa tissue samples and cell lines. METHODS IgG expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and Western blot. The possible significance of IgG was evaluated on tissue array and cell lines. To assess cell viability and proliferation, MTS assay was carried out. Apoptosis was evaluated with propidium iodide and annexin-V staining. RESULTS Expressions of IgG and its related genes were detected in cell lines. Abundant gene expressions of Igγ and Igκ chain were detected in PCa tissue samples, but not in normal prostate tissues. In addition, IgG expression was significantly higher in PCa tissues than in the benign prostate hyperplasia tissues (P<0.001). Igγ expression was positively correlated to Gleason score and histological grade (P<0.05). Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that anti-human monoclonal IgG antibody suppressed cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in cultured PCa cells. CONCLUSION IgG gene expression in PCa is related to cell differentiation and clinical status. PCa cell produced IgG is involved in the biological behavior of this cancer and may serve as a useful marker for cancer cell differentiation and prognosis. Locally produced IgG could be a potential target for therapy. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84867577134	CA215 and GnRH receptor as targets for cancer therapy	Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), RP215 and GHR106, were selected for the preclinical evaluations of anti-cancer drugs targeting various human cancers including those of the ovary, cervix, lung, and liver. Both Mabs were shown to react with pan cancer markers, which are over-expressed on the surface of almost all human cancers. RP215 Mab was shown to react with the carbohydrate- associated epitope(s) of cancer cell-expressed glycoproteins, mainly consisting of immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins and mucins, generally known as CA215. GHR106 Mab was generated against the extracellular domain of human GnRH receptor, which is also highly expressed on the cancer cell surface. Preclinical studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy of these two Mabs as anti-cancer drugs for treating human cancers. High tumor specificity of RP215 Mab was demonstrated with immunohistochemical staining studies of various cancer cell lines, as well as normal and cancerous tissue sections. These two Mabs were shown to induce apoptosis as well as complement-dependent cytotoxicity upon treatment to many cultured cancer cells. Significant dosedependent growth inhibition of tumor cells from several different tissue origins were demonstrated by nude mouse experiments. It was further demonstrated that GHR106 Mab can function as long-acting GnRH analogs in its biological actions. Efforts were made to generate human/ mouse chimeric forms of the GHR106 Mab. Based on the results of these preclinical studies, we believe that these two Mabs, in chimeric or humanized forms, can be developed into suitable therapeutic agents for treatment of human cancers as anti-cancer drugs. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84868317404	IgG Expression in Human Colorectal Cancer and Its Relationship to Cancer Cell Behaviors	Increasing evidence indicates that various cancer cell types are capable of producing IgG. The exact function of cancer-derived IgG has, however, not been elucidated. Here we demonstrated the expression of IgG genes with V(D)J recombination in 80 cases of colorectal cancers, 4 colon cancer cell lines and a tumor bearing immune deficient mouse model. IgG expression was associated with tumor differentiation, pTNM stage, lymph node involvement and inflammatory infiltration and positively correlated with the expressions of Cyclin D1, NF-κB and PCNA. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of cancer-derived IgG on the malignant behaviors of colorectal cancer cells and showed that blockage of IgG resulted in increased apoptosis and negatively affected the potential for anchor-independent colony formation and cancer cell invasion. These findings suggest that IgG synthesized by colorectal cancer cells is involved in the development and growth of colorectal cancer and blockage of IgG may be a potential therapy in treating this cancer. © 2012 Niu et al.

84871414988	Influence and distribution of CD133 and CD34 antigen expression in proximal tubule epithelial cells during ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats	Objective: To study the influence and distribution in proximal tubule epithelial cells with the expressions of CD133 and CD34 in a rat model so as to provide a study basis for renal adult stem cell. Methods: The kidney ischemia/reperfusion model was established by blocking the bilateral renal arteries for about 50 min and recovering the renal perfusion of blood. Then the rat kidneys were extracted at Days 3, 5 and 7 post-modeling. After a series of special treatment, immunohistochemical staining was used to show the distribution and expression intensity of KIM-1, Brdu antigen, CD34 and CD133 antigens in cells with the elapsing of time. Results: As compared with control group, the KIM-1 and CD133 antigens were present in cotex renis while the CD34 and Brdu antigens were distributed in parts of medulla renis and juncture of cotex-medulla renis. The expression density value of KIM-1 and CD133 antigens rose for the first 3 days then declined afterward (40.3% ± 3.2%, 57.5% ± 3.8%, 24.3% ± 1.4%). Otherwise the expression density value of CD 34 antigen declined(56.0% ± 4.8%, 44.2% ± 2.2%, 28.8% ± 1.0%) and Brdu antigen showed an upward trend at post-operation(10.0% ± 1.1%, 36.0% ± 4.2%, 48.8% ± 5.0%). Conclusion: After ischemia/reperfusion injury in kidney, the expression rates of CD133 and KIM-1 antigen rise obviously in cotex renis. And the D34 and Brdu antigens show a similar trend in medulla renis. The result indicates that the phenomenon of proliferation and differentiation may appears in kidney proximal tubule and migrate from the region of medulla renis to cotex renis. The participating cells not only possess the strong proliferation and repairing ability of stem/progenitor cells, but also can expresses the CD34 and CD133 antigens. Thus it is may provide a study basis for the tissue reconstruction of nephron and research in the field of kidney adult stem cell.

84874880509	Immunoglobulin G expression and its potential role in primary and metastatic breast cancers	Recently immunoglobulin G (IgG) was found to be produced by neoplasms and promote tumor growth in cancer cell lines and animal models. To investigate the pathophysiological significance of cancer-produced IgG in breast cancer, we examined the expressions of IgG in 68 breast cancers including 40 primary cancers without metastasis and 28 cancers with axillary lymph node metastases. IgG gene expression was detected in all these samples. We found that IgG-expressing cancer cells were predominantly located in the periphery of the primary cancer nest and that these cells showed more cellular atypia and nuclear pleomorphism. We also found that the abundance of IgG-expressing cancer cells was higher and the cells were more evenly distributed in the metastatic cancer cells than that in the primary lesion. These findings suggest that IgG-expressing breast cancer cells have a more aggressive biological behavior than the IgG negative cancer cells and it could be an indicator for progression and metastasis of the disease. Co-localization of IgG and C1q complement was detected in both primary and metastatic lesions implying that immune complexes might be formed in situ. We speculate that such immune complexes might facilitate immune escape of cancer cells. Our findings suggest that locally produced IgG plays important roles in breast cancer, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84874907993	Correlation of Immunoglobulin G Expression and Histological Subtype and Stage in Breast Cancer	Introduction: Recently, growing evidence indicates that immunoglobulins (Igs) are not only produced by mature B lymphocytes or plasma cells, but also by various normal cells types at immune privileged sites and neoplasm, including breast cancer. However, the association of breast cancer derived IgG with genesis and development of the disease has not yet been established. Methods: In this study we examined the expression of IgG in 186 breast cancers, 20 benign breast lesions and 30 normal breast tissues. Both immunohistochemistry with antibodies to Igκ (immunoglobulin G κ light chain) and Igγ (immunoglobulin G heavy chain) and in situ hybridization with an antisense probe to IgG1 heavy chain constant region gene were performed. Various clinicopathological features were also analyzed. Results: We found that IgG is specifically expressed in human breast cancer cells. Both infiltrating ductal carcinoma and infiltrating lobular carcinoma had significantly greater numbers of Igκ and Igγ positive cancer cells as compared with medullary carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and benign lesions (all p<0.05). In addition, IgG expression was correlated with breast cancer histological subtypes (p<0.01) and AJCC stages (p<0.05), with more abundance of IgG expression in more malignant histological subtypes or in more advanced stage of the disease. Conclusions: IgG expression in breast cancer cells is correlated with malignancy and AJCC stages of the cancers. This suggests that breast cancer derived IgG may be associated with genesis, development and prognosis of the cancer. © 2013 Yang et al.

84875659848	Short Placental Telomere was Associated with Cadmium Pollution in an Electronic Waste Recycling Town in China	In Guiyu, an electronic waste recycling site near Shantou, Guangdong province, China, primitive ways of e-waste processing have caused severe cadmium and lead pollution to the local residents. However, the possible effects of cadmium or lead pollution to genomic integrity of the local residents have not been investigated. We examined the possible relationship between cadmium and lead concentrations in placenta and placental telomere length in Guiyu and compared the data with that of a non-polluted town. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and real-time PCR were used to determine placental cadmium and lead concentrations, and placental telomere length. We found that placental cadmium concentration was negatively correlated with placental telomere length (r = -0.138, p = 0.013). We also found that placental cadmium concentration of 0.0294 μg/g might be a critical point at which attrition of placental telomere commenced. No significant correlation between placental lead concentration and placental telomere length was detected (r = 0.027, p = 0.639). Our data suggest that exposure to cadmium pollution during pregnancy may be a risk factor for shortened placental telomere length that is known to be related to cancer development and aging. Furthermore, grave consequence on the offspring from pregnancies in e-waste polluted area is indicated. © 2013 Lin et al.

84878501648	Role of stanniocalcin 1 in brain injury of coal-burning-borne fluorosis rats	Objective: To observe the change of stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) and calcium content in brain of coal-burning-borne fluorosis rats, and to explore the role of STC1 in brain injury of coal-burning-borne fluorosis. Methods: Twenty four male SD rats were randomly divided into control, low, medium, and high fluoride groups according to body mass. Control group was fed conventional rat chow (fluorinated 1.3 mg/kg), and low, medium and high fluoride groups fed with fluorinated feed (20.0, 40.0, 60.0 mg/kg). All rats were given distilled water and feed ad libitum. One hundred and eighty days after modeling, STC1 protein and gene expression in the brain tissue of rats were detected using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR and calcium content of brain tissue was detected. Results: The cell positive rates of STC1 in low, medium, high fluoride groups [(48.10 ± 2.11)%, (54.90 ± 1.73)%, (79.30 ± 3.71)%] were significantly higher than that of the control group [(24.70 ± 3.53)%, all P < 0.05], the cell positive rate of high fluoride group was significantly higher than that of the low and medium fluoride groups (all P < 0.05). The STC1 mRNA expression of low, medium and high fluoride groups (0.58 ± 0.09, 0.85 ± 0.17, 1.75 ± 0.04) were significantly higher than that in the control group (0.37 ± 0.12, all P < 0.05), the STC1 mRNA expressions of high fluoride group was significantly higher than that of the low and medium fluoride groups (all P < 0.05). The brain cortex calcium ion concentrations of low, medium and high fluoride groups [(138.62 ± 4.19), (167.43 ± 6.57), (189.45 ± 3.72)nmol/L] were significantly higher than that in the control group [(101.47 ± 9.46)nmol/L, all P < 0.05], the brain cortex calcium ion concentrations of high fluoride group was significantly higher than that of the low and medium fluoride groups (all P < 0.05), and the medium fluoride groups was higher than the low groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: STC1 may be involved in brain damage of coal-burning-borne fluorosis rats through regulating calcium balance.

84890243733	Aberrant chimeric RNA GOLM1-MAK10 encoding a secreted fusion protein as a molecular signature for human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	It is increasingly recognized that chimeric RNAs may exert a novel layer of cellular complexity that contributes to oncogenesis and cancer progression, and could be utilized as molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To date yet no fusion chimeric RNAs have been identified in esophageal cancer, the 6th most frequent cause of cancer death in the world. While analyzing the expression of 32 recurrent cancer chimeric RNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) from patients and cancer cell lines, we identified GOLM1-MAK10, as a highly cancer-enriched chimeric RNA in ESCC. In situ hybridization revealed that the expression of the chimera is largely restricted to cancer cells in patient tumors, and nearly undetectable in non-neoplastic esophageal tissue from normal subjects. The aberrant chimera closely correlated with histologic differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that chimera GOLM1-MAK10 encodes a secreted fusion protein. Mechanistic studies reveal that GOLM1-MAK10 is likely derived from transcription read-through/splicing rather than being generated from a fusion gene. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism involved in ESCC and provide a novel potential target for future therapies. The secreted fusion protein translated from GOLM1-MAK10 could also serve as a unique protein signature detectable by standard non-invasive assays. These observations are critical as there is no clinically useful molecular signature available for detecting this deadly disease or monitoring the treatment response.

84888767664	Effects and interactions of MiR-577 and TSGA10 in regulating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Testis specific 10 (TSGA10) was originally identified as a testis-specific protein and tumor-associated antigen in a number of cancer types. In this study, we found that down-regulation of TSGA10 was associated with increased malignancy and clinical features of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). Moreover, increased expression of TSGA10 inhibited, while its knockdown promoted, tumor formation in vivo in nude mice. At the 3'UTR of the TSGA10 gene we identified two binding sites for microRNA-577 (miR-577). Further investigation demonstrated that expression levels of miR-577 and TSGA10 were negatively correlated to each other in ESCC cell lines and tumor samples. Moreover, manipulation of miR-577 and TSGA10 expression confirmed that miR-577 can regulate TSGA10 and in turn affect cell proliferation in vitro. Additionally, with flow cytometry and manipulation of the mir-577/TSGA10 axis, it was found that mir-577/TSGA10 axis influenced the growth of ESCCthrough regulating the G1-S phase transition. We also obtained evidence to establish that mir-577/TSGA10 axis activation was always accompanied by inactivation of the p53 pathway or the Rb pathway or both, thus, the latter two pathways are obligatory for progression of ESCCs with mir-577/TSGA10 axis activation. In addition, we found that such an interactive pathway in regulating cancer cell proliferation was restricted to a few cancer types including ESCC, but not uniformly applicable to other cancer types. This newly discovered regulatory mechanism provides a new dimension for ESCC diagnosis and therapy.

However, humans appear to be clinically susceptible mostly to the 2.3.4 virus clade. Here, we demonstrated that A549 cells and human macrophages infected with clade 2.3.4 viruses produced significantly more viruses than those infected with the other two clades. Likewise, clade 2.3.4-infected macrophages caused the most severe cellular damage and strongest proinflammatory response. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

84891683794	Practicing pathology in the era of big data and personalized medicine	The traditional task of the pathologist is to assist physicians in making the correct diagnosis of diseases at the earliest possible stage to effectuate the optimal treatment strategy for each individual patient. In this respect surgical pathology (the traditional tissue diagnosis) is but a tool. It is not, of itself, the purpose of pathology practice; and change is in the air. This January 2014 issue of Applied Immunohistochemistry and Molecular Morphology (AIMM) embraces that change by the incorporation of the agenda and content of the journal Diagnostic Molecular Morphology (DMP). Over a decade ago AIMM introduced and promoted the concept of "molecular morphology," and has sought to publish molecular studies that correlate with the morphologic features that continue to define cancer and many diseases. That intent is now reinforced and extended by the merger with DMP, as a logical and timely response to the growing impact of a wide range of genetic and molecular technologies that are beginning to reshape the way in which pathology is practiced. The use of molecular and genomic techniques already demonstrates clear value in the diagnosis of disease, with treatment tailored specifically to individual patients. Personalized medicine is the future, and personalized medicine demands personalized pathology. The need for integration of the flood of new molecular data, with surgical pathology, digital pathology, and the full range of pathology data in the electronic medical record has never been greater. This review describes the possible impact of these pressures upon the discipline of pathology, and examines possible outcomes. There is a sense of excitement and adventure. Active adaption and innovation are required. The new AIMM, incorporating DMP, seeks to position itself for a central role in this process. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

84891822361	Cancer-derived immunoglobulin G promotes tumor cell growth and proliferation through inducing production of reactive oxygen species	Cancer cells have been found to express immunoglobulin G (IgG), but the exact functions and underlying mechanisms of cancerderived IgG remain elusive. In this study, we first confirmed that downregulation of IgG restrained the growth and proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate its mechanism, we carried out a co-immunoprecipitation assay in HeLa cells and identified 27 potential IgG-interacting proteins. Among them, receptor of activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1), ras-related nuclear protein (RAN) and peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) are closely related to cell growth and oxidative stress, which prompted us to investigate the mechanism of action of IgG in the above phenomena. Upon confirmation of the interactions between IgG and the three proteins, further experiments revealed that downregulation of cancer-derived IgG lowered levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enhancing cellular total antioxidant capacity. In addition, a few ROS scavengers, including catalase (CAT), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), n-acetylcysteine (NAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), further inhibited the growth of IgG-deficient cancer cells through suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular- regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway induced by a low level of intracellular ROS, whereas exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H

84896091911	Stain-Decolorize-Stain (SDS): A new technique for multiple staining	Multiple staining of more than one gene/antigen on a single tissue section is an indispensable tool in cell and tissue research. However, most of the available multiple staining techniques have limitations, and there has been no technique to simultaneously visualize and distinguish tissue antigens, nucleotide sequences and other chemical compounds on the same slide. Here, we present a practical and economic multiple stain technique, with which multiple cellular components including mRNA (with in situ hybridization), antigen epitope (with immunohistochemistry) and chemical molecules (with histochemistry) can be stained on a single tissue section to study their relationship. In addition, this technique also offers the possibility to evaluate morphology with an H&E staining on the same sections. We used the placenta, pancreas, breast ductal carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, cerebellum, tonsil and heart tissue sections to evaluate the applicability of this new technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the technique have been tested, and an optimal protocol is recommended. Its applications in surgical pathology and research are discussed. This technique offers a novel tool to evaluate the relationship among multiple components at the same or adjacent locations to meet the needs of pathology diagnosis and research. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84901314942	Immunoglobulin G expression in lung cancer and its effects on metastasis	Lung cancer is one of the leading malignancies worldwide, but the regulatory mechanism of its growth and metastasis is still poorly understood. We investigated the possible expression of immunoglobulin G (IgG) genes in squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung and related cancer cell lines. Abundant mRNA of IgG and essential enzymes for IgG synthesis, recombination activation genes 1, 2 (RAG1, 2) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) were detected in the cancer cells but not in adjacent normal lung tissue or normal lung epithelial cell line. The extents of IgG expression in 86 lung cancers were found to associate with clinical stage, pathological grade and lymph node metastasis. We found that knockdown of IgG with siRNA resulted in decreases of cellular proliferation, migration and attachment for cultured lung cancer cells. Metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) appeared to be co-expressed with IgG in lung cancer cells. Statistical analysis showed that the rate of IgG expression was significantly correlated to that of MTA1 and to lymph node metastases. Inhibition of MTA1 gene expression with siRNA also led to decreases of cellular migration and attachment for cultured lung cancer cells. These evidences suggested that inhibition of cancer migration and attachment induced by IgG down-regulation might be achieved through MTA1 regulatory pathway. Our findings suggest that lung cancer-produced IgG is likely to play an important role in cancer growth and metastasis with significant clinical implications. © 2014 Jiang et al.

84902291521	Contribution of neural cell death to depressive phenotypes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice	Major depression disorder (MDD) or depression is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetes, and the depressive symptoms are more severe and less responsive to antidepressant therapies in these patients. The underlying mechanism is little understood. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of comorbid depression was more complex than that proposed for MDD and that neural cell death played a role in the disease severity. To test this hypothesis, we generated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. These mice had blood glucose levels threefold above controls and exhibited depressive phenotypes as judged by a battery of behavioral tests, thus confirming the comorbidity in mice. Immunohistological studies showed markedly increased TUNEL-positive cells in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the comorbid mice, indicating apoptosis. This finding was supported by increased caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 proteins in these brain regions. In addition, the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level of comorbid mice was reduced compared with controls, further supporting the neurodegenerative change. Mechanistic analyses showed an increased expression of mitochondrial fission genes fission protein 1 ( Fis1) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and a decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion genes mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), mitofusin 2 (Mfn2 ) and optical atrophy 1 (Opa1). Representative assessment of the proteins Drp1 and Mfn2 mirrored the mRNA changes. The data demonstrated that neural cell death was associated with the depressive phenotype of comorbid mice and that a fission-dominant expression of genes and proteins mediating mitochondrial dynamics played a role in the hyperglycemia-induced cell death. The study provides new insight into the disease mechanism and could aid the development of novel therapeutics aimed at providing neuroprotection by modulating mitochondrial dynamics to treat comorbid depression with diabetes.

12144289432	An Assessment of World Health Organization Criteria for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Patients with Cancer	BACKGROUND. The differential diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in patients with cancer can be challenging. Although diagnostic criteria for SARS have been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), simple adoption of the established criteria may lead to overdiagnosis in patients with cancer or to an increase in the risk of spreading SARS within cancer hospitals. METHODS. The authors report their experience with the exclusion and quarantine of patients with cancer during the peak of the SARS epidemic in Beijing, China. The patients included 4 males and 7 females with a median age of 66 years (range, 39-73 years). RESULTS. All 11 patients met the WHO diagnostic criteria for probable SARS. Among those 11 patients with probable SARS, only 1 had confirmed SARS; for the other 10 patients, the possibility of SARS infection was ruled out. CONCLUSIONS. Special attention must be paid to patients with cancer who have symptoms similar to those seen in SARS. Although the WHO diagnostic criteria for SARS should be widely accepted, they are not definite or practical in certain populations. © 2004 American Cancer Society.

13744252289	Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus is detected in intestinal tissues of fatal cases	OBJECTIVES: A significant percentage of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, and the viral sequence was detectable in the stool of most patients. At present, the knowledge of the pathology of the digestive system in SARS patients is limited. Because a resurgence of the SARS epidemic is constantly possible, there is an urgent need to understand the involvement of the digestive system in this new disease. METHODS: We performed seven SARS autopsies in which samples of alimentary tract and digestive glands were examined with routine pathology, electron microscopy (EM). In situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The main histopathological finding was atrophy of the mucosal lymphoid tissue. A few mucosal epithelial cells and lymphocytes in the intestine were positively stained for coronavirus with ISH. SARS-coronavirus (CoV)-like particles were found in the mucosal epithelial cells under EM and mild focal inflammation was detected in the alimentary tract. One patient who experienced severe diarrhea had pseudomembranous enteritis of the ileum. Fatty degeneration and central lobular necrosis were observed in the liver. No evidence of direct viral infection was found in the esophagus, the stomach, the salivary gland, the liver, or the pancreas. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract is another target of SARS-CoV infection, as the intestinal epithelial cells and mucosal lymphoid tissue are infected. The findings provide possible explanations for the gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of virus in the stool of SARS patients. © 2005 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.
