77954561353	Higher moments of net proton multiplicity distributions at RHIC	We report the first measurements of the kurtosis (κ), skewness (S), and variance (σ2) of net-proton multiplicity (Np-Np̄) distributions at midrapidity for Au+Au collisions at √sNN=19.6, 62.4, and 200 GeV corresponding to baryon chemical potentials (μB) between 200 and 20 MeV. Our measurements of the products κσ2 and Sσ, which can be related to theoretical calculations sensitive to baryon number susceptibilities and long-range correlations, are constant as functions of collision centrality. We compare these products with results from lattice QCD and various models without a critical point and study the √sNN dependence of κσ2. From the measurements at the three beam energies, we find no evidence for a critical point in the QCD phase diagram for μB below 200 MeV. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

84877788842	Identification of b-quark jets with the CMS experiment	At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at s = 7 TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb

84908177088	Measurement of the ratio of inclusive jet cross sections using the anti- k T algorithm with radius parameters R=0.5 and 0.7 in pp collisions at s =7TeV	Measurements of the inclusive jet cross section with the anti-kT clustering algorithm are presented for two radius parameters, R=0.5 and 0.7. They are based on data from LHC proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0fb-1 collected with the CMS detector in 2011. The ratio of these two measurements is obtained as a function of the rapidity and transverse momentum of the jets. Significant discrepancies are found comparing the data to leading-order simulations and to fixed-order calculations at next-to-leading order, corrected for nonperturbative effects, whereas simulations with next-to-leading-order matrix elements matched to parton showers describe the data best.

84908277959	Measurement of jet multiplicity distributions in (Formula presented.) production in pp collisions at (Formula presented.)	The normalised differential top quark-antiquark production cross section is measured as a function of the jet multiplicity in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7(Formula presented.) at the LHC with the CMS detector. The measurement is performed in both the dilepton and lepton+jets decay channels using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0(Formula presented.). Using a procedure to associate jets to decay products of the top quarks, the differential cross section of the (Formula presented.) production is determined as a function of the additional jet multiplicity in the lepton+jets channel. Furthermore, the fraction of events with no additional jets is measured in the dilepton channel, as a function of the threshold on the jet transverse momentum. The measurements are compared with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics and no significant deviations are observed.

43049133258	Enhanced strange baryon production in Au+Au collisions compared to p+p at sNN=200 GeV	We report on the observed differences in production rates of strange and multistrange baryons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV compared to p+p interactions at the same energy. The strange baryon yields in Au+Au collisions, when scaled down by the number of participating nucleons, are enhanced relative to those measured in p+p reactions. The enhancement observed increases with the strangeness content of the baryon, and it increases for all strange baryons with collision centrality. The enhancement is qualitatively similar to that observed at the lower collision energy sNN=17.3 GeV. The previous observations are for the bulk production, while at intermediate pT,1<pT<4 GeV/c, the strange baryons even exceed binary scaling from p+p yields. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

43949107889	Centrality dependence of charged hadron and strange hadron elliptic flow from sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions	We present STAR results on the elliptic flow v2 of charged hadrons, strange and multistrange particles from sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The detailed study of the centrality dependence of v2 over a broad transverse momentum range is presented. Comparisons of different analysis methods are made in order to estimate systematic uncertainties. To discuss the nonflow effect, we have performed the first analysis of v2 with the Lee-Yang zero method for KS0 and Λ. In the relatively low pT region, pT≤2GeV/c, a scaling with mT-m is observed for identified hadrons in each centrality bin studied. However, we do not observe v2(pT) scaled by the participant eccentricity to be independent of centrality. At higher pT,2≤pT≤6GeV/c,v2 scales with quark number for all hadrons studied. For the multistrange hadron Ω, which does not suffer appreciable hadronic interactions, the values of v2 are consistent with both mT-m scaling at low pT and number-of-quark scaling at intermediate pT. As a function of collision centrality, an increase of pT-integrated v2 scaled by the participant eccentricity has been observed, indicating a stronger collective flow in more central Au+Au collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

45349088511	Spin alignment measurements of the K*0(892) and (1020) vector mesons in heavy ion collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We present the first spin alignment measurements for the K*0(892) and (1020) vector mesons produced at midrapidity with transverse momenta up to 5 GeV/c at sNN=200 GeV at RHIC. The diagonal spin-density matrix elements with respect to the reaction plane in Au+Au collisions are ρ00=0.32±0.04 (stat) ± 0.09 (syst) for the K*0 (0.8<pT<5.0 GeV/c) and ρ00=0.34±0.02 (stat) ± 0.03 (syst) for the (0.4<pT<5.0 GeV/c) and are constant with transverse momentum and collision centrality. The data are consistent with the unpolarized expectation of 1/3 and thus no evidence is found for the transfer of the orbital angular momentum of the colliding system to the vector-meson spins. Spin alignments for K*0 and in Au+Au collisions were also measured with respect to the particle's production plane. The result, ρ00=0.41±0.02 (stat) ± 0.04 (syst), is consistent with that in p+p collisions, ρ00=0.39±0.03 (stat) ± 0.06 (syst), also measured in this work. The measurements thus constrain the possible size of polarization phenomena in the production dynamics of vector mesons. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

The masses and widths of these resonances are studied as a function of transverse momentum pT. We observe that the resonance spectra follow a generalized scaling law with the transverse mass mT. The pT of resonances in minimum bias collisions are compared with the pT of π,K, and p̄. The ρ0/π-,K*/K-,Δ++/p,Σ(1385)/Λ, and Λ(1520)/Λ ratios in d+Au collisions are compared with the measurements in minimum bias p+p interactions, where we observe that both measurements are comparable.

We find that the directed flow depends on the incident energy but, contrary to all available model implementations, not on the size of the colliding system at a given centrality. We extend the validity of the limiting fragmentation concept to v1 in different collision systems, and investigate possible explanations for the observed sign change in v1(pt). © 2008 The American Physical Society.

We observe that the dynamical fluctuations are nonzero at all energies and exhibit a modest dependence on beam energy. A weak system size dependence is also observed. We examine the collision centrality dependence of the net charge fluctuations and find that dynamical net charge fluctuations violate 1/Nch scaling but display approximate 1/Npart scaling. We also study the azimuthal and rapidity dependence of the net charge correlation strength and observe strong dependence on the azimuthal angular range and pseudorapidity widths integrated to measure the correlation. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

63049105920	Observation of two-source interference in the photoproduction reaction AuAu→AuAuρ0	In ultraperipheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a photon from the electromagnetic field of one nucleus can fluctuate to a quark-antiquark pair and scatter from the other nucleus, emerging as a ρ0. The ρ0 production occurs in two well-separated (median impact parameters of 20 and 40 F for the cases considered here) nuclei, so the system forms a two-source interferometer. At low transverse momenta, the two amplitudes interfere destructively, suppressing ρ0 production. Since the ρ0 decays before the production amplitudes from the two sources can overlap, the two-pion system can only be described with an entangled nonlocal wave function, and is thus an example of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. We observe this suppression in 200 GeV per nucleon-pair gold-gold collisions. The interference is 87%±5%(stat.) ±8%(syst.) of the expected level. This translates into a limit on decoherence due to wave function collapse or other factors of 23% at the 90% confidence level. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

64149108573	Systematic measurements of identified particle spectra in pp, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at the STAR detector	Identified charged-particle spectra of π±, K±, p, and p̄ at midrapidity (|y|<0.1) measured by the dE/dx method in the STAR (solenoidal tracker at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) time projection chamber are reported for pp and d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV and for Au+Au collisions at 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV. Average transverse momenta, total particle production, particle yield ratios, strangeness, and baryon production rates are investigated as a function of the collision system and centrality. The transverse momentum spectra are found to be flatter for heavy particles than for light particles in all collision systems; the effect is more prominent for more central collisions. The extracted average transverse momentum of each particle species follows a trend determined by the total charged-particle multiplicity density. The Bjorken energy density estimate is at least several GeV/fm3 for a formation time less than 1 fm/c. A significantly larger net-baryon density and a stronger increase of the net-baryon density with centrality are found in Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV than at the two higher energies. Antibaryon production relative to total particle multiplicity is found to be constant over centrality, but increases with the collision energy. Strangeness production relative to total particle multiplicity is similar at the three measured RHIC energies. Relative strangeness production increases quickly with centrality in peripheral Au+Au collisions, to a value about 50% above the pp value, and remains rather constant in more central collisions. Bulk freeze-out properties are extracted from thermal equilibrium model and hydrodynamics-motivated blast-wave model fits to the data. Resonance decays are found to have little effect on the extracted kinetic freeze-out parameters because of the transverse momentum range of our measurements. The extracted chemical freeze-out temperature is constant, independent of collision system or centrality; its value is close to the predicted phase-transition temperature, suggesting that chemical freeze-out happens in the vicinity of hadronization and the chemical freeze-out temperature is universal despite the vastly different initial conditions in the collision systems. The extracted kinetic freeze-out temperature, while similar to the chemical freeze-out temperature in pp, d+Au, and peripheral Au+Au collisions, drops significantly with centrality in Au+Au collisions, whereas the extracted transverse radial flow velocity increases rapidly with centrality. There appears to be a prolonged period of particle elastic scatterings from chemical to kinetic freeze-out in central Au+Au collisions. The bulk properties extracted at chemical and kinetic freeze-out are observed to evolve smoothly over the measured energy range, collision systems, and collision centralities. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67650109881	Measurements of meson production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)	We present results for the measurement of meson production via its charged kaon decay channel →K+K- in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4,130, and 200 GeV, and in p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV from the STAR experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The midrapidity (|y|<0.5) meson transverse momentum (pT) spectra in central Au+Au collisions are found to be well described by a single exponential distribution. On the other hand, the pT spectra from p+p, d+Au, and peripheral Au+Au collisions show power-law tails at intermediate and high pT and are described better by Levy distributions. The constant /K- yield ratio vs beam species, collision centrality, and colliding energy is in contradiction with expectations from models having kaon coalescence as the dominant mechanism for production at RHIC. The Ω/ yield ratio as a function of pT is consistent with a model based on the recombination of thermal s quarks up to pT~4 GeV/c, but disagrees at higher transverse momenta. The measured nuclear modification factor, RdAu, for the meson increases above unity at intermediate pT, similar to that for pions and protons, while RAA is suppressed due to the energy loss effect in central Au+Au collisions. Number of constituent quark scaling of both Rcp and v2 for the meson with respect to other hadrons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV at intermediate pT is observed. These observations support quark coalescence as being the dominant mechanism of hadronization in the intermediate pT region at RHIC. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The multiplicity and transverse momentum dependences of the extracted correlation lengths (radii) are studied. The scaling with charged particle multiplicity of the apparent system volume at final interaction is studied for the RHIC energy domain.

70350215885	Growth of long range forward-backward multiplicity correlations with centrality in au+au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Forward-backward multiplicity correlation strengths have been measured with the STAR detector for Au+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV. Strong short- and long-range correlations (LRC) are seen in central Au+Au collisions. The magnitude of these correlations decrease with decreasing centrality until only short-range correlations are observed in peripheral Au+Au collisions. Both the dual parton model (DPM) and the color glass condensate (CGC) predict the existence of the long-range correlations. In the DPM, the fluctuation in the number of elementary (parton) inelastic collisions produces the LRC. In the CGC, longitudinal color flux tubes generate the LRC. The data are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the DPM and indicate the presence of multiple parton interactions. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

70449459077	Neutral pion production in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The results of midrapidity (0<y<0.8) neutral pion spectra over an extended transverse momentum range (1<pT<12 GeV/c) in sNN=200 Ge, Au+Au collisions, measured by the STAR experiment, are presented. The neutral pions are reconstructed from photons measured either by the STAR Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter or by the Time Projection Chamber via tracking of conversion electron-positron pairs. Our measurements are compared to previously published π± and π0 results. The nuclear modification factors RCP and RAA of π0 are also presented as a function of pT. In the most central Au+Au collisions, the binary collision scaled π0 yield at high pT is suppressed by a factor of about 5 compared to the expectation from the yield of p+p collisions. Such a large suppression is in agreement with previous observations for light quark mesons and is consistent with the scenario that partons suffer considerable energy loss in the dense medium formed in central nucleus-nucleus collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The inclusive J/ψ production cross section for Cu+Cu collisions is found to be consistent at high pT with the binary collision-scaled cross section for p+p collisions. At a confidence level of 97%, this is in contrast to a suppression of J/ψ production observed at lower pT.

The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry was measured in the range of 3.7<pT<11GeV/c and excludes a maximal positive gluon polarization in the proton.

Significant correlated yield for pairs with large longitudinal separation Δη is observed in central Au+Au collisions, in contrast to d+Au collisions. The associated yield distribution in Δη×ΔΦ can be decomposed into a narrow jet-like peak at small angular separation which has a similar shape to that found in d+Au collisions, and a component that is narrow in ΔΦ and depends only weakly on Δη, the "ridge." Using two systematically independent determinations of the background normalization and shape, finite ridge yield is found to persist for trigger pt>6 GeV/c, indicating that it is correlated with jet production. The transverse-momentum spectrum of hadrons comprising the ridge is found to be similar to that of bulk particle production in the measured range (2<pt<4 GeV/c). © 2009 The American Physical Society.

This study explores the system size dependence of two novel features observed at RHIC with heavy ions: the hadron suppression at high-pT and the anomalous baryon to meson enhancement at intermediate transverse momenta. Both phenomena could be attributed to the creation of a new form of QCD matter. The results presented here bridge the system size gap between the available pp and Au+Au data, and allow for a detailed exploration of the onset of the novel features. Comparative analysis of all available 200 GeV data indicates that the system size is a major factor determining both the magnitude of the hadron spectra suppression at large transverse momenta and the relative baryon to meson enhancement. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

These domains are predicted to lead to charge separation of quarks along the orbital momentum of the system created in noncentral collisions. To study this effect, we investigate a three-particle mixed-harmonics azimuthal correlator which is a P-even observable, but directly sensitive to the charge-separation effect. We report measurements of this observable using the STAR detector in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at √sNN=200 and 62GeV. The results are presented as a function of collision centrality, particle separation in rapidity, and particle transverse momentum.

Charge ordering properties are exploited to separate the jetlike component and the ridge (long range Δη correlation). The results indicate that the correlation of ridge particles are uniform not only with respect to the trigger particle but also between themselves event by event in our measured Δη.

Photons from the decay π0→γγ were detected in the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The η→γγ decay was also observed and constituted the first η measurement by STAR.

77956151577	Balance functions from Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions at √sNN=200 GeV	Balance functions have been measured for charged-particle pairs, identified charged-pion pairs, and identified charged-kaon pairs in Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions at √sNN=200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider using the STAR detector. These balance functions are presented in terms of relative pseudorapidity, Δη, relative rapidity, Δy, relative azimuthal angle, Δ, and invariant relative momentum, qinv. For charged-particle pairs, the width of the balance function in terms of Δη scales smoothly with the number of participating nucleons, while hijing and urqmd model calculations show no dependence on centrality or system size. For charged-particle and charged-pion pairs, the balance functions widths in terms of Δη and Δy are narrower in central Au+Au collisions than in peripheral collisions. The width for central collisions is consistent with thermal blast-wave models where the balancing charges are highly correlated in coordinate space at breakup. This strong correlation might be explained by either delayed hadronization or limited diffusion during the reaction. Furthermore, the narrowing trend is consistent with the lower kinetic temperatures inherent to more central collisions. In contrast, the width of the balance function for charged-kaon pairs in terms of Δy shows little centrality dependence, which may signal a different production mechanism for kaons. The widths of the balance functions for charged pions and kaons in terms of qinv narrow in central collisions compared to peripheral collisions, which may be driven by the change in the kinetic temperature. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

For associated particles at higher pT2.5 GeV/c, narrow correlation peaks are seen in d+ Au and Au+Au, indicating that the main production mechanism is jet fragmentation. At lower associated particle pT<2 GeV/c, a large enhancement of the near- (Δ0) and away-side (Δπ) associated yields is found, together with a strong broadening of the away-side azimuthal distributions in Au+Au collisions compared to d+ Au measurements, suggesting that other particle production mechanisms play a role. This is further supported by the observed significant softening of the away-side associated particle yield distribution at Δπ in central Au+Au collisions. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

79956303213	Observation of the antimatter helium-4 nucleus	High-energy nuclear collisions create an energy density similar to that of the Universe microseconds after the Big Bang; in both cases, matter and antimatter are formed with comparable abundance. However, the relatively short-lived expansion in nuclear collisions allows antimatter to decouple quickly from matter, and avoid annihilation. Thus, a high-energy accelerator of heavy nuclei provides an efficient means of producing and studying antimatter. The antimatter helium-4 nucleus (), also known as the anti-(), consists of two antiprotons and two antineutrons (baryon number B = '4). It has not been observed previously, although the -particle was identified a century ago by Rutherford and is present in cosmic radiation at the ten per cent level. Antimatter nuclei with B'1 have been observed only as rare products of interactions at particle accelerators, where the rate of antinucleus production in high-energy collisions decreases by a factor of about 1,000 with each additional antinucleon. Here we report the observation of, the heaviest observed antinucleus to date. In total, 18 counts were detected at the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC; ref. 6) in 10 9 recorded gold-on-gold (Au+Au) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 200 GeV and 62 GeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. The yield is consistent with expectations from thermodynamic and coalescent nucleosynthesis models, providing an indication of the production rate of even heavier antimatter nuclei and a benchmark for possible future observations of in cosmic radiation. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Pairs of back-to-back high-transverse-momentum hadrons are used for triggers to study associated hadron distributions. In contrast with two- and three-particle correlations with a single trigger with similar kinematic selections, the associated hadron distribution of both trigger sides reveals no modification in either relative pseudorapidity Δη or relative azimuthal angle Δ from d+Au to central Au+Au collisions. We determine associated hadron yields and spectra as well as production rates for such correlated back-to-back triggers to gain additional insights on medium properties. © 2011 American Physical Society.

We use the observed longitudinal broadening of the near-side peak of C with increasing centrality to estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density, η/s, of the matter formed in central Au. +. Au interactions. We obtain an upper limit estimate of η/s that suggests that the produced medium has a small viscosity per unit entropy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84859565899	ρ0 photoproduction in AuAu collisions at √s 	Vector mesons may be photoproduced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions when a virtual photon emitted by one nucleus scatters from the other nucleus, emerging as a vector meson. The STAR Collaboration has previously presented measurements of coherent ρ0 photoproduction at center of mass energies of 130 GeV and 200 GeV in AuAu collisions. Here, we present a measurement of the cross section at 62.4 GeV; we find that the cross section for coherent ρ0 photoproduction with nuclear breakup is 10.5±1.5±1.6 mb at 62.4 GeV. The cross-section ratio between 200 GeV and 62.4 GeV is 4.4±0.6, less than is predicted by most theoretical models. It is, however, proportionally much larger than the previously observed 15%±55% increase between 130 GeV and 200 GeV. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84871443529	A new Boson with a mass of 125 GeV observed with the CMS experiment at the large hadron collider	The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force-the W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup>, and Z <sup>0</sup> bosons-as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of the background is about 1 in 3 x 10<sup>6</sup>. The new particle is a boson with spin not equal to 1 and has a mass of about 1.25 giga-electron volts. Although its measured properties are, within the uncertainties of the present data, consistent with those expected of the Higgs boson, more data are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the new particle.

84873169344	Search for supersymmetry in events with photons and low missing transverse energy in pp collisions at √s=7TeV	Many models of new physics, including versions of supersymmetry (SUSY), predict production of events with low missing transverse energy, electroweak gauge bosons, and many energetic final-state particles. The stealth SUSY model yields this signature while conserving R-parity by means of a new hidden sector in which SUSY is approximately conserved. The results of a general search for new physics, with no requirement on missing transverse energy, in events with two photons and four or more hadronic jets are reported. The study is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV corresponding to 4.96fb

Two different and complementary approaches have been followed. The first approach exploits the distributions of the pseudorapidity of the recoil jet and reconstructed top-quark mass using background estimates determined from control samples in data. The second approach is based on multivariate analysis techniques that probe the compatibility of the candidate events with the signal. Data have been collected for the muon and electron final states, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.17 and 1.56 fb

84876921503	Experimental studies of di-jets in Au + Au collisions using angular correlations with respect to back-to-back leading hadrons	Jet-medium interactions are studied via a multihadron correlation technique (called "2+1"), where a pair of back-to-back hadron triggers with large transverse momentum is used as a proxy for a di-jet. This work extends the previous analysis for nearly symmetric trigger pairs with the highest momentum threshold of trigger hadron of 5 GeV/c with the new calorimeter-based triggers with energy thresholds of up to 10 GeV and above. The distributions of associated hadrons are studied in terms of correlation shapes and per-trigger yields on each trigger side.

84878933146	Search for heavy resonances in the W/Z-tagged dijet mass spectrum in pp collisions at 7 TeV	A search has been made for massive resonances decaying into a quark and a vector boson, qW or qZ, or a pair of vector bosons, WW, WZ, or ZZ, where each vector boson decays to hadronic final states. This search is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb<sup>-1</sup> of proton-proton collisions collected in the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. For sufficiently heavy resonances the decay products of each vector boson are merged into a single jet, and the event effectively has a dijet topology. The background from QCD dijet events is reduced using recently developed techniques that resolve jet substructure. A 95% CL lower limit is set on the mass of excited quark resonances decaying into qW (qZ) at 2.38 TeV (2.15 TeV) and upper limits are set on the cross section for resonances decaying to qW, qZ, WW, WZ, or ZZ final states.

84882288454	Search for new physics with long-lived particles decaying to photons and missing energy in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV	A search is performed for long-lived neutral particles decaying into a photon and invisible particles. An example of such a signature is the decay of the lightest neutralino with nonzero lifetime into a gravitino and a photon in gauge-mediated supersymmetry, with the neutralino as the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle and the gravitino as the lightest. The search uses events containing photons, missing transverse energy, and jets. The impact parameter of the photon relative to the beam-beam collision point can be reconstructed using converted photons. The method is sensitive to lifetimes of the order of 0.1 to 1 ns. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.23 fb

84892921965	Fluctuations of charge separation perpendicular to the event plane and local parity violation in s NN = 200 GeV Au + Au collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider	Previous experimental results based on data (∼15×106 events) collected by the STAR detector at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider suggest event-by-event charge-separation fluctuations perpendicular to the event plane in noncentral heavy-ion collisions. Here we present the correlator previously used split into its two component parts to reveal correlations parallel and perpendicular to the event plane. The results are from a high-statistics 200-GeV Au + Au collisions data set (57×106 events) collected by the STAR experiment. We explicitly count units of charge separation from which we find clear evidence for more charge-separation fluctuations perpendicular than parallel to the event plane. We also employ a modified correlator to study the possible P-even background in same- and opposite-charge correlations, and find that the P-even background may largely be explained by momentum conservation and collective motion. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84899717564	Event-plane-dependent dihadron correlations with harmonic vn subtraction in Au + Au collisions at s NN =200 GeV	STAR measurements of dihadron azimuthal correlations (Δφ) are reported in midcentral (20-60%) Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV as a function of the trigger particle's azimuthal angle relative to the event plane, φs=|φt-ψEP|. The elliptic (v2), triangular (v3), and quadratic (v4) flow harmonic backgrounds are subtracted using the zero yield at minimum (ZYAM) method. The results are compared to minimum-bias d+Au collisions. It is found that a finite near-side (|Δφ|<π/2) long-range pseudorapidity correlation (ridge) is present in the in-plane direction (φs∼0). The away-side (|Δφ|>π/2) correlation shows a modification from d+Au data, varying with φs. The modification may be a consequence of path-length-dependent jet quenching and may lead to a better understanding of high-density QCD. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5fb-1 and was collected at s=8TeV by the CMS experiment. No significant excess is observed in the data above the expected background, and the existence of top-quark partners with masses below 800 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level, assuming they decay exclusively to tW. This is the first limit on these particles from the LHC, and it is significantly more restrictive than previous limits. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84899752374	Measurement of charge multiplicity asymmetry correlations in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions at sNN =200 GeV	A study is reported of the same- and opposite-sign charge-dependent azimuthal correlations with respect to the event plane in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The charge multiplicity asymmetries between the up/down and left/right hemispheres relative to the event plane are utilized. The contributions from statistical fluctuations and detector effects were subtracted from the (co-)variance of the observed charge multiplicity asymmetries. In the mid- to most-central collisions, the same- (opposite-) sign pairs are preferentially emitted in back-to-back (aligned on the same-side) directions. The charge separation across the event plane, measured by the difference, Δ, between the like- and unlike-sign up/down-left/right correlations, is largest near the event plane. The difference is found to be proportional to the event-by-event final-state particle ellipticity (via the observed second-order harmonic v2obs), where Δ=[1.3±1.4(stat)-1.0+4.0(syst)]×10- 5+[3.2±0.2(stat)-0.3+0.4(syst)]×10-3v2obs for 20-40% Au+Au collisions.

84899764938	Measurement of higher-order harmonic azimuthal anisotropy in PbPb collisions at s NN =2.76 TeV	Measurements are presented by the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the higher-order harmonic coefficients that describe the azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles emitted in sNN=2.76 TeV PbPb collisions. Expressed in terms of the Fourier components of the azimuthal distribution, the n=3-6 harmonic coefficients are presented for charged particles as a function of their transverse momentum (0.3<pT<8.0GeV/c), collision centrality (0%-70%), and pseudorapidity (|η|<2.0). The data are analyzed using the event plane, multiparticle cumulant, and Lee-Yang zeros methods, which provide different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. Taken together with earlier LHC measurements of elliptic flow (n=2), the results on higher-order harmonic coefficients develop a more complete picture of the collective motion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions and shed light on the properties of the produced medium. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

A data set collected with the CMS detector at the LHC is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No excess is seen in the observed number of events relative to the standard model prediction; thus, no evidence for flavor-changing neutral currents in top-quark decays is found. A combination with a previous search at 7 TeV excludes a t→Zq branching fraction greater than 0.05% at the 95% confidence level. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

Events are examined in which there are two photons forming a Higgs boson candidate, and at least two b-quark jets. In 19.7fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at s=8TeV, recorded in the CMS experiment, no evidence of a signal is found and lower limits at the 95% confidence level are set, excluding the top squark mass below 360 to 410 GeV, depending on the Higgsino mass. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

The results are based on data recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0fb-1. The cross sections are measured for photon transverse momenta pTγ>15GeV, and for separations between photons and final-state charged leptons in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal plane of ΔR(,γ)>0.7 in νγ and γ final states, where refers either to an electron or a muon.

The measured total inclusive cross sections times branching fractions are σ(pp→WX)×B(W→ν)=12.21±0.03(stat)±0. 24(syst)±0.32(lum)nb and σ(pp→ZX)×B(Z→+-)=1. 15±0.01(stat)±0.02(syst)±0.03(lum)nb for the dilepton mass in the range of 60 - 120 GeV.

The new boson is observed as a narrow resonance with a local significance of 6.8 standard deviations, a measured mass of 125.6±0.4(stat)±0. 2(syst)GeV, and a total width ≤3.4GeV at the 95% confidence level.

Its spin-parity properties are found to be consistent with the expectations for the standard-model Higgs boson.

The data sample was collected in 2010 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, with an integrated luminosity of 36pb-1.

84907497913	Search for massive resonances decaying into pairs of boosted bosons in semi-leptonic final states at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV	Abstract: A search for new resonances decaying to WW, ZZ, or WZ is presented. Final states are considered in which one of the vector bosons decays leptonically and the other hadronically. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb<sup>−1</sup>recorded in proton-proton collisions at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Techniques aiming at identifying jet substructures are used to analyze signal events in which the hadronization products from the decay of highly boosted W or Z bosons are contained within a single reconstructed jet. Upper limits on the production of generic WW, ZZ, or WZ resonances are set as a function of the resonance mass and width. We increase the sensitivity of the analysis by statistically combining the results of this search with a complementary study of the all-hadronic final state. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the bulk graviton production cross section in the range from 700 to 10 fb for resonance masses between 600 and 2500 GeV, respectively. These limits on the bulk graviton model are the most stringent to date in the diboson final state.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]

The analysis is performed on an inclusive sample of multijet events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb<sup>−1</sup>, collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The search uses novel jet-substructure identification techniques that provide sensitivity to the presence of highly boosted vector bosons decaying into a pair of quarks. Exclusion limits are set at a confidence level of 95% on the production of: (i) excited quark resonances q<sup>*</sup>decaying to qW and qZ for masses less than 3.2 TeV and 2.9 TeV, respectively, (ii) a Randall-Sundrum graviton G<inf>RS</inf> decaying into WW for masses below 1.2 TeV, and (iii) a heavy partner of the W boson W<sup>′</sup> decaying into WZ for masses less than 1.7 TeV.

84907266414	Evidence of b -jet quenching in PbPb collisions at sNN =2.76TeV	The production of jets associated to bottom quarks is measured for the first time in PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair. Jet spectra are reported in the transverse momentum (pT) range of 80-250GeV/c, and within pseudorapidity |η|<2. The nuclear modification factor (RAA) calculated from these spectra shows a strong suppression in the b-jet yield in PbPb collisions relative to the yield observed in pp collisions at the same energy. The suppression persists to the largest values of pT studied, and is centrality dependent. The RAA is about 0.4 in the most central events, similar to previous observations for inclusive jets. This implies that jet quenching does not have a strong dependence on parton mass and flavor in the jet pT range studied.

84914697722	Search for supersymmetry with razor variables in pp collisions at s =7TeV	The razor approach to search for R-parity conserving supersymmetric particles is described in detail. Two analyses are considered: an inclusive search for new heavy particle pairs decaying to final states with at least two jets and missing transverse energy, and a dedicated search for final states with at least one jet originating from a bottom quark. For both the inclusive study and the study requiring a bottom-quark jet, the data are examined in exclusive final states corresponding to all-hadronic, single-lepton, and dilepton events. The study is based on the data set of proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1. The study consists of a shape analysis performed in the plane of two kinematic variables, denoted MR and R2, that correspond to the mass and transverse energy flow, respectively, of pair-produced, heavy, new-physics particles. The data are found to be compatible with the background model, defined by studying event simulations and data control samples. Exclusion limits for squark and gluino production are derived in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) and also for simplified-model spectra (SMS). Within the CMSSM parameter space considered, squark and gluino masses up to 1350 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the model parameters. For SMS scenarios, the direct production of pairs of top or bottom squarks is excluded for masses as high as 400 GeV.
