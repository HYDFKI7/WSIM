84928143359	A memory-efficient TCAM COPROCESSOR for IPv4/IPv6 routing table update	Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is a simple hardware device for fast IP lookups that can perform a lookup per cycle. However, prefixes may be inserted into or deleted from the TCAM because of changes in Internet topology. Traditional TCAM coprocessors maintain the enclosure relationship among prefixes by using an extended binary trie and perform TCAM movements based on an update algorithm (e.g., CAO-OPT) which runs on a local CPU to maintain the speed and correctness of the TCAM search process. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient TCAM coprocessor architecture for updates that require only small memory size compared with the extended binary trie. The average number of TCAM movements per update is almost the same as that of CAO-OPT. However, the time to compute how to move TCAM entries in the proposed TCAM coprocessor is less than that in CAO-OPT. Only a small part of total TCAM search cycles is used to complete our update process. The proposed TCAM architecture can also be made smaller and faster because large off-chip memory for the extended binary trie and a local CPU are no longer necessary.

15544374876	Simple and fast IP lookups using binomial spanning trees	High performance Internet routers require an efficient IP lookup algorithm to forward millions of packets per second. Various binary trie data structures are normally used in software-based routers. Binary trie based lookup algorithms are simple not only for searching for the longest prefix match but also for updating the routing table. In this paper, we propose a new IP lookup algorithm based on binomial spanning trees. The proposed algorithm has the same advantages of simple search and update processes as the ones based on binary trie. However, the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of memory requirement and the lookup time is better than the schemes based on binary tries, such as path-compression and level-compression. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

24144449886	Power-efficient TCAM partitioning for IP lookups with incremental updates	Ternary Content-Addressable Memories (TCAMs) provide a fast mechanism for IP lookups and a simple management for route updates. The high power consumption problem can be resolved by providing a TCAM partitioning technique that selectively addresses smaller portions of a TCAM. This paper proposes a 2-level TCAM architecture using prefix comparison rule to partition the routing table into a number of buckets of possibly equal sizes. The 2-level architecture results in a 2-step lookup process. The first step determines which bucket is used to search the input IP. The second step only searches the IP in the determined bucket from the first step. The prefix partitioning algorithm provides an incremental update. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has lower power consumption than the existing TCAM partitioning algorithms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

27544437532	A small and fast IP forwarding table using hashing	Building next generation routers with the capability of for-warding multiple millions of packets per second is required for the increasing demand for high bandwidth on the Internet. Reducing the required memory size of the forwarding table is a possible solution since small for-warding table can be integrated into the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). In this paper a hash technique is developed to reduce the size of the IP forwarding table. The proposed data structure is a compressed 8-8-8-8 multibit trie that is based on hash tables of 4-bit addresses. Two optimization techniques are also proposed to further improve the performance of the proposed schemes. Our experimental results show that the proposed hashing-based schemes are better than the Small Forwarding Table scheme [6] both in memory size and lookup latency.

33744463425	Web-based energy-efficient cache invalidation in wireless mobile environment	More and more users use mobile devices to retrieve dynamic web pages in the wireless networks. Caching dynamic pages becomes very important due to the power constraint of mobile devices. In this paper, we first introduce a framework to cache and manage the dynamic web pages on the server side such that these dynamic pages can also be cached in the mobile devices. Then we propose a stateful IR-based approach which only records two numbers, the number of web pages updated and the number of web pages updated and also queried after they are updated on the server in an IR interval. Recording these two numbers dramatically reduces the IR size. The experiments show that our proposed approach combined with the Timestamp and UIR algorithms consumes the power around 40~47% less than the original Timestamp and UIR. Also, our method performs better than the Perfect Server that has the full knowledge of the contents stored in all the mobile client's caches in terms of power consumption. © 2005 IEEE.

33751232321	Fast binary and multiway prefix searches for packet forwarding	Backbone routers with tens-of-gigabits-per-second links are indispensable communication devices to deploy on the Internet. The IP lookup operation is the most critical task that must be improved in routers. In this paper, we first present a systematic method to compare prefixes of different lengths. The list of prefixes can then be sorted and stored in a sequential array, which is contrary to the linked lists used in most of trie-based structures. Next, fast binary and multiway prefix searches assisted by auxiliary prefixes are proposed. We also developed a 32-bit representation to encode the prefixes of different lengths. For the large routing tables currently available on the Internet, the proposed multiway prefix search can achieve the worst-case number of memory accesses of three and four if the sizes of the CPU cache lines are 64 bytes and 32 bytes, respectively. The IPv4 simulation results show that the proposed prefix searches outperform the existing IP lookup schemes in terms of lookup times and memory consumption. The simulations using IPv6 routing tables also show the performance advantages of the proposed binary prefix searches. We also analyze the performance of the existing lookup schemes by concurrently considering the lookup speed, the update speed, and the memory consumption. Although the update speed of the proposed prefix search is worse than the dynamic routing table schemes with log(N) complexity for a table of N prefixes, our analysis shows that the overall performance of the proposed binary prefix search outperforms all the existing schemes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33845522931	Dynamic routing tables using simple balanced search trees	Various schemes for high-performance IP address lookups have been proposed recently. Pre-computations are usually used by the special designed IP address lookup algorithms to improve the lookup speed and reduce the memory requirement. However, the disadvantage of the pre-computation based schemes is when a single prefix is added or deleted, the entire data structure may need to be rebuilt. Rebuilding the entire data structure seriously affects the lookup performance of a backbone router, and thus is not suitable for dynamic routing tables. In this paper, we develop a new dynamic routing table algorithm. The proposed data structure consists of a collection of balanced binary search trees. The search, insertion, and deletion operations can be finished in O(log N) time, where N is the number of prefixes in a routing table. Comparing with the best existing dynamic routing table algorithm, PBOB (Prefix Binary tree On Binary tree), our experiment results using the real routing tables show that the proposed scheme performs better than PBOB in terms of the lookup speed, insertion time, deletion time, and memory requirement. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

33947254374	A 2-level TCAM architecture for ranges	As the demand for high-quality Internet increases, emerging network applications are spurring the need for faster, feature-rich, and cost-effective routers. Multifield packet classification in routers has been a computation-intensive data path function for software implementation. Therefore, solutions for packet classification based on hardware design, such as Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM), are necessary to sustain gigabit line processing rate. Traditionally, TCAMs have been designed for storing prefixes. However, multifield packet classification usually involves two fields of arbitrary ranges that are TCP/IP layer 4 source and destination ports. Storing ranges in TCAMs relies on decomposing each individual range into multiple prefixes, which leads to range-to-prefix blowout. To reduce the total number of prefixes needed to represent all ranges, this paper proposes a 2-level TCAM architecture and two range-to-prefix conversion schemes. In the first proposed scheme, designed for disjoint ranges, the maximum number of entries needed in TCAM is 2m - 1 for m disjoint ranges. In the second proposed scheme, designed for contiguous ranges, only m TCAM entries are needed. In a general case of n arbitrary ranges, all ranges can first be converted into disjoint ranges or contiguous ranges and then the proposed algorithms can be applied. As a result, only 4n - 3 TCAM entries are needed for the disjoint ranges and only 2n + 1 TCAM entries are needed for contiguous ranges. This paper also proposes insertion and deletion algorithms to accommodate incremental changes to the range sets. The experiments made show that the proposed range-to-prefix conversion schemes perform better than the existing schemes in terms of the number of required TCAM entries and execution time for range update operations. © 2006 IEEE.

35248867003	Power-efficient and path-stable broadcasting scheme for wireless ad hoc networks	The simplest broadcasting scheme in the mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) uses flooding which may result in the broadcast storm problem. The MultiPoint Relays (MPR) is another broadcasting scheme for solving the broadcast storm problem. In MPR, the mobile hosts (MHs) use a greedy algorithm to find a connected dominating set (CDS) by the exchange of 2-hop neighbor information. In order to reduce the size of CDS, the greedy algorithm used by MPR usually selects the farthest nodes from the source called the border nodes as the forwarding nodes. Since the border nodes have a higher probability of moving out the transmission range, the routing paths in MPR from the source to some destinations may be unstable. In this paper, we propose a broadcasting scheme called Dynamic Power-aware and Stability-aware MultiPoint Relays (DPS-MPR) which avoids selecting the border nodes as the forwarding nodes. As a result, the transmission range of MHs can be reduced for saving energy and the negative impact of unstable forwarding nodes can also be reduced. In addition, we use a range buffer to further enhance the stability of the forwarding nodes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed DPS-MPR by using NS2 and compared it with the existing schemes. The experimental result shows that DPS-MPR saves 20%-25% of energy and increases the lifetime of forwarding nodes by several seconds. © 2007 IEEE.

35348879768	Improved methods for divisible load distribution on k-dimensional meshes using multi-installment	In the divisible load distribution, the classic methods on linear arrays divide the computation and communication processes into multiple time intervals in a pipelined fashion. Li [21] has proposed a set of improved algorithms for linear arrays which can be generalized to k-dimensional meshes. In this paper, we first propose the algorithm M (multi-installment) that employs the multi-installment technique to improve the best algorithm Q proposed by Li. Second, we propose the algorithm S (start-up cost) that includes the computation and communication start-up costs in the design. While the asymptotic speedups of our algorithms M and S derived from the closed-form solutions are the same as algorithm Q, our algorithms approach the optimal speedups considerably faster than algorithm Q as the number of processors increases. Finally, we combine algorithms M and S and propose the algorithm MS. While algorithm MS has the same the asymptotic performance as algorithms Q and S, it achieves a better speedup when the load to be processed is very large and the number of processors is fixed or when the load to be processed is fixed and the number of processors is small. © 2007 IEEE.

39349087191	Efficient TCAM encoding schemes for packet classification using gray code	Packet classification is an enabling function in Internet routers for a variety of Internet applications. In order to classify Internet packets into flows, Internet routers must perform searches over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. Because of its speed and simple filter management the Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) is currently the dominant hardware solution for IP lookups, Le., a one-dimensional packet classification. To make TCAM the solution for the multi-dimensional packet classification, efficient methods that store the range fields of the classification tables in TCAM are needed. In this paper, we propose a set of novel range encoding schemes based on Gray code. Many range-encoding techniques are used to improve the existing elementary intervalbased range encoding schemes. The present experiment's results show that the proposed Gray code-based schemes consume less TCAM storage space than the existing schemes. © 2007 IEEE.

77954252458	A high-speed and memory efficient pipeline architecture for packet classification	Multi-field Packet classification is the main function in high-performance routers. The current router design goal of achieving a throughput higher than 40 Gbps and supporting large rule sets simultaneously is difficult to be fulfilled by software approaches. In this paper, a set pruning trie based pipelined architecture called Set Pruning Multi-Bit Trie (SPMT) is proposed for multi-field packet classification. However, the problem of rule duplications in SPMT that may cause a memory blowup must be solved in order to implement SPMT with large rule sets in FPGA devices consisting of limited on-chip memory. We will propose two rule grouping schemes to reduce rule duplications in SPMT. The first scheme called Partition by Wildcards (PW) divides the rules into subgroups based on the positions of their wildcard fields. The second scheme called Partition by Length (PL) rules partitions the rules into subgroups according to their prefix lengths. Based on our performance experiments on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA device, the proposed pipeline architecture can achieve a throughput of over 100 Gbps with dual port memory. Also, the rule sets of up to 10k rules can be fit into the on-chip memory of Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA device. © 2010 IEEE.

77954346502	The cost effective pre-processing based NFA pattern matching architecture for NIDS	Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a system which can detect network attacks resulted from worms and viruses on the Internet. An efficient pattern matching algorithm plays an important role in NIDS. There have been many proposed methods for pattern matching algorithms. Traditionally, the multi-character NFA that is capable of matching multiple characters per cycle can be built by duplicating entire circuit of 1-character architecture. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing based architecture to improve the original multi-character architecture. The design of the proposed architecture and its implementation in FPGA are described in details. Our simulation results show that the proposed architecture performs better than all the existing Brute-Force based approaches in terms of the throughput and the slice utilization. Specifically, the proposed architectures of 2-character and 4-character designs can achieve the throughputs of 4.68 and 7.27 Gbps and the slice utilization of 2.86 and 2.10 in terms of char/slice, respectively. © 2010 IEEE.

77954346662	Grid of segment trees for packet classification	Packet classification problem has received much attention and continued to be an important topic in recent years. In packet classification problem, each incoming packet should be classified into flows according to a set of pre-defined rules. Grid-of-tries (GoT) is one of the traditional algorithmic schemes for solving 2-dimensional packet classification problem. The advantage of GoT is that it uses the switch pointers to avoid backtracking operation during the search process. However, the primary data structure of GoT is base on binary tries. The traversal of binary tries decreases the performance of GoT due to the heights of binary tries are usually high. In this paper, we propose a scheme called GST (Grid of Segment Trees). GST modifies the original GoT by replacing the binary tries with segment trees. The heights of segment trees are much shorter than those of binary tries. As a result, the proposed GST can inherit the advantages of GoT and segment trees to achieve better performance. Experiments conducted on three different kinds of rule tables show that our proposed scheme performs better than traditional schemes, such as hierarchical tries and grid-of-tries. © 2010 IEEE.

79952431225	A technical model using genetic algorithm for the cosmetic tourism business	The medical skills in some developing countries are almost as advanced as those in developed countries. Medical cost, however, is relatively lower in the developing countries. In recent years, the medical industry in some developing countries has exhibited the trend of providing international medical services. Taiwan's medical quality and instruments are at par with those of most developed countries. The average medical cost is relatively more reasonable. Generally, the infrastructure in Taiwan is at a respectable level to be able to develop international medical treatment and to offer short-term vacations. Furthermore, an oversea tourist will require specific post-cosmetic care after he/she had finished the cosmetic treatments and preferred to have a short-term vacation in that area. Generally, the post-cosmetic care during the vacation is important to effectiveness of the cosmetic treatments. In this paper, we aim to explore technical models for serving the overseas tourist and realizing the collaborative business services of cosmetic treatments and travel tourisms. The proposed Cosmetic Tourist Guiding Model (CTGM), which includes the Genetic Algorithm (GA) scheduling function for planning suitable trips and remote pre-assessable functions, can provide overseas visitors convenient services and allows the cooperation of business owners of medical treatment facilities and travel agencies.

47749154423	A novel cooperative caching scheme for wireless ad hoc networks: GoupCaching	In the mobile ad hoc network, a mobile host can communicate with others anywhere and anytime. Cooperative caching scheme can improve the accessibility of data objects. However, the cache hit ratio is reduced and access latency becomes longer significantly due to the mobility of MHs, energy consumption in battery, and limited wireless bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative caching scheme called GroupCaching (GC) which allows each MH and its 1-hop neighbors form a group. The caching status is exchanged and maintained periodically in a group. By using the proposed GroupCaching, the caching space in MHs can be efficiently utilized and thus the redundancy of cached data is decreased and the average access latency is reduced. We evaluate the performance of the GroupCaching by using NS2 and compare it with the existing schemes such as CacheData and ZoneCooperative. The experimental results show that the cache hit ratio is increased by about 3%-30% and the average latency is reduced by about 5%-25% compared with other schemes. © 2007 IEEE.

50249175144	Multi-character processor array for pattern matching in network intrusion detection system	Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a system developed for identifying attacks by using a set of rules. NIDS is an efficient way to provide the security protection for today's internet. Pattern match algorithm plays an important role in NIDS that performs searches against multiple patterns for a string match. Pattern matching is a computationally expensive task. Traditional software-based NIDS solutions usually can not achieve a high-speed required for ever growing Internet attacks. In order to satisfy high-speed packet content inspection, hardware-implementable pattern match algorithm is required. In this paper, we propose a hardware-based pattern match architecture that employs a multi-character processor array. The proposed multi-character processor rray is a parallel and pipelined architecture which can process multiple characters of the input stream per cycle. The proposed architecture can reduce a lot of unnecessary computations and thus it is power efficient. We use Snort pattern sets and DEFCON packet traces to perform our simulations.

50249184830	Dynamic cache invalidation scheme in IR-based wireless environments	Traditional cache invalidation schemes are not suitable to be employed in wireless environments due to the affections of mobility, energy consumption, and limited bandwidth. Cache invalidation report (IR) is proposed to deal with the cache consistency problem. However, the main drawback of IR-based schemes is the long latency of data access because the mobile hosts (MHs) need to wait next IR interval for cache invalidation when the cache hit happens. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Invalidation Report (DIR) to reduce the latency of data access when the MHs query data. DIR contains an early cache validation mechanism by utilizing the validation messages. Therefore, the MHs can verify their cached data as soon as possible. Next, we design a predictive method to dynamically adjust IR interval to further reduce the latency called DIR-AI (DIR with Adjustable Interval) scheme. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the DIR and DIR-AI and compare them with the existing invalidation report schemes by using NS2 (Network Simulator). The experimental results show that DIR reduces averagely 54.3% and 34.3% of latency; DIR-AI reduces averagely 57.35 and 38.6% of latency compared with TS (TimeStamp) and UIR (Updated IR) schemes respectively. © 2008 IEEE.

50249164897	Improved TCAM-based pre-filtering for network intrusion detection systems	With the increasing growth of the Internet, the explosion of attacks and viruses significantly affects the network security. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNPlike TCAM searching engine (FTSE) [5] [6] is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance. The first technique performs the w-byte suffix pattern match instead of using w-byte prefix. The second technique finds the matching results from all groups rather than first group.

63049121681	Efficient multidimensional packet classification with fast updates	Packet classification has continued to be an important research topic for high-speed routers in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new packet classification scheme based on the binary range and prefix searches. The basic data structure of the proposed packet classification scheme for multidimensional rule tables is a hierarchical list of sorted ranges and prefixes that allows the binary search to be performed on the list at each level to find the best matched rule. We also propose a set of heuristics to further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm. We test our schemes by using rule tables of various sizes generated by ClassBench and compare them with the existing schemes, EGT, EGT-PC, and HyperCuts. The performance results show that in a test using a 2D segmentation table, the proposed scheme not only performs better than the EGT, EGT-PC, and HyperCuts in classification speed and memory usage but also achieves faster table update operations that are not supported in the existing schemes. © 2009 IEEE.

63049122435	Dynamic segment trees for ranges and prefixes	In this paper, we develop a segment tree data structure for solving dynamic table lookup problems. The proposed dynamic segment tree (DST) uses all of the distinct end points of ranges as the keys based on a new range end point scheme. The new end point scheme generates fewer end points than the traditional end point scheme. DST is implemented as a balanced binary search tree augmented with a range set in each node. The performance of accessing and updating the ranges stored in each node is improved by an efficient range set data structure that combines the priority queue and the interval tree. Based on the proposed data structures, the time complexities of search, insertion, and deletion in a set of N arbitrary ranges are O(log N), O(log N times log Max), and O(Max times log N times log Max), respectively, where Max is the maximum number of ranges covering any address. In practical routing tables, Max is a small constant (six for the routing tables we tested). The memory requirement for DST is O(N log N). The experimental results using real Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) routing tables show that both the DST and prefix binary tree on binary tree (PBOB) by Lu et al. (2004) perform much better than the multiway range tree (MRT) by Warkhede et al. (2004) and prefix in B-tree (PIBT) by Lu et al. (2005) in terms of update speed and memory consumption, but DST performs much better than PBOB and a little slower than MRT and PIBT in terms of search speed. © 2007 IEEE.

70349490112	A fast and memory efficient dynamic ip lookup algorithm based on b-tree	This paper deals with the traditional IP address lookup problem with fast updates. We propose a B-tree data structure, called MMSPT (Multiway Most Specific Prefix Tree), which is constructed by using the most specific prefixes in routing tables. MMSPT arranges the most specific prefixes as the keys in B-tree. Unlike the previous schemes, every prefixes in routing tables is stored exactly once in our MMSPT. For a routing table of n prefixes, MMSPT requires O(n) memory, and the time for search, insertion and deletion operations are O(logmn), O(mlogmn), and O(mlogmn), respectively (m is the order of the B-tree). Our experimental results conducted by using five real IPv4 routing tables show that MMSPT outperforms two existing B-tree data structures, PIBT (Prefix In B-Tree) and MRT (Multiway Range Tree), in all aspects. Moreover, since the complexities of MMSPT is not subject to the length of IP addresses, the proposed MMSPT can be easily extended to fit the IPv6. © 2009 IEEE.

To meet the requirements in high speed routers consisting of linecards with 40Gbps transfer rates, researchers usually take lookup/update speed, storage requirement, and scalability into consideration when designing a high performance forwarding engine. As a result, hardwarebased solutions are often used to develop a high speed router nowadays. In this paper, we develop a FPGAbased pipelined forwarding engine which focuses on reducing the update overhead. The proposed scheme partitions the routing table into several disjoint groups. The prefix which resides in the same group is interleaving stored into several memory modules to ensure the parallel comparison at the comparison stage.

74949092402	Update-aware controlled prefix expansion for fast IP lookups	In high performance routers design, fast IP address lookup is always a challenge. In order to obtain fast lookup speed, multi-bit tries are often used to represent the routing tables [1, 2, 3, 6]. The drawbacks of multi-bit tries are the large memory usage and extensive update cost. To reduce the memory usage of multi-bit tries, Srinivasan and Varghese proposed a scheme called Controlled Prefix Expansion (CPE) [2] that uses the dynamic programming technique to obtain the optimal multi-bit tries in terms of memory usage. Furthermore, current backbone routers usually run the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP may cause a few hundred of updates per second. To make multi-bit tries adequate to these updates, a series of multi-bit tries nodes need to be modified. Since these updates can seriously affect the lookup speed, we need to minimize these update cost. However, CPE does not concern this issue. In this paper, we explore the optimization issue in terms of the update cost. We want to find an update-optimal multi-bit tries that still have the efficiency of lookup speed and memory usage. Contrast to CPE, our solutions achieve a 26% reduction of the update overhead and improve 38% of the search speed. Besides, we also examine our schemes in IPv6 routing tables. The experimental results show that our scheme can also scale well in IPv6. © 2009 IEEE.

74949121357	Packet processing with blocking for bursty traffic on multi-thread network processor	It is well-known that there are bursty accesses in network traffic. It means a burst of packets with the same meaningful headers are usually received by routers at the same time. With such traffic, routers usually perform the same computations and access the same memory location repeatedly. To utilize this characteristic of network traffic, many cache schemes are proposed to deal with the bursty access patterns. However, in the multi-thread network processor based routers, the existing cache schemes will not suit to the bursty traffic. Since all threads may all deal with the packets with the same headers, if the former threads do not update the cache entries yet, the subsequent threads still have to repeat the computations due to the cache miss. In this paper, we propose a cache scheme called B-cache for the multi-thread network processors. B-cache blocks the subsequent threads from doing the same computations which are being processed by the former thread. By applying B-cache, any packet processing tasks with high locality characteristic, such as IP address lookup, packet classification, and intrusion detection, can avoid the duplicate computations and hence achieve a better packet processing rate. We implement the proposed B-cache scheme on Intel IXP2400 network processor, the experimental results shows that our B-cache scheme can achieves the line speed of Intel IXP2400. © 2009 IEEE.

77649240063	Dynamic multiway segment tree for IP lookups and the fast pipelined search engine	A dynamic multiway segment tree (DMST) is proposed for IP lookups in this paper. DMST is designed for dynamic routing tables that can dynamically insert and delete prefixes. DMST is implemented as a B-tree that has all distinct end points of ranges as its keys. The complexities of search, insertion, deletion, and memory requirement are the same as the existing multiway range tree (MRT) and prefix in B-tree (PIBT) for prefixes. In addition, a pipelined DMST search engine is proposed to further speed up the search operations. The proposed pipelined DMST search engine uses off-chip SRAMs instead of on-chip SRAMs because the capacity of the latter is too small to hold large routing tables and the cost of the latter is too expensive. By utilizing current FPGA and off-chip SRAM technologies, our proposed five-stage pipelined search engine can achieve the worst case throughputs of 33.3 and 41.7 million packets per second (Mpps) with 144-bit and 288-bit wide SRAM blocks, respectively. Furthermore, a straightforward extension of the pipelined search engine with multiple independent off-chip SRAMs can achieve the throughput of 200 Mpps which is equivalent to 102 Gbps for minimal Ethernet packets of size 64 bytes. © 2010 IEEE.

The IMIS could provide semantic analysis of personal health status by using the knowledge base and fuzzy inference rules, which are pre-established by domain experts. This scheme is a well-defined composition, including a FML editor, a FML parser, a fuzzy inference mechanism and a semantic decision-making mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is feasible for semantic decision of personal health. A person can understand his physical conditions via the generated semantic decision-marking mechanism by the input of vital signs. © 2009 IEEE.

78149246058	Towards optimized packet processing for multithreaded network processor	With the evolution of the Internet, current routers need to support a variety of emerging network applications while the high packet processing rate is still guaranteed. As a result, the network processor has become a promising solution for network devices due to its computation capability and programming flexibility. However, developing the network applications on network processors is not easy. How to efficiently program multiple processing elements and utilize various memory modules as well as the hardware resources on network processors are always challenges. In this paper, we investigate several optimization issues and programming techniques that should be considered by the developers to achieve higher packet processing rate on network processors. We use an existing packet classification scheme called hierarchical binary prefix search (HBPS) [I] as the benchmark to test and evaluate these optimization techniques. The experiments conducted on Intel IXP2400 network processor show that the overall performance of HBPS can be improved about 42% while these techniques are adopted. © 2010 IEEE.

78149303619	Service creation and composition for realization on service-oriented architecture	Applying ICT to assist daily activities and interests is already a worldwide trend. Through software and network techniques, computers could remotely provide various services. Up to now, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become one of the most popular techniques to realize these daily services in various areas. Therefore, we would need systematic methods for services creation from a service-centric viewpoint. In this paper, we first illustrated the progress of service realization. The interoperability of service creation and realization along its life cycle were carefully explained. With methodical sequences, domain-specific services can be well created and designed. The home-care services were demonstrated in the case study. These services were verified by a pilot trial in a real environment. The experimental results showed the usability and effectiveness. We believe that a successful experience on service realization is worthy to be shared.

79957754756	Set pruning segment trees for packet classification	Nowadays, multi-field packet classification is one of the most important technologies to support various services in next generation routers. In this paper, we propose a segment tree based parallel SRAM-based pipelined architecture called Set Pruning Segment Trees (SPST) for multi-dimensional packet classification. For solving the memory blowup problem, a grouping scheme called Partition by Length (PL) is used to reduce the rule duplications in SPST. Additionally, we also propose an optimization called Set Pruning Multi-way Segment Trees (SPMST) to reduce the tree level and hardware cost. The key feature of our proposed architecture is that memory consumption is reduced significantly regardless of the characteristics of various rule tables. The proposed pipelined architecture can achieve a throughput of 89.4 Gbps for minimum sized packets with dual port memory on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA device. © 2011 IEEE.

79957764082	Layered cutting scheme for packet classification	Packet classification is an important topic for highspeed routers nowadays. There are many packet classification algorithms based on decision tree like Hicuts, Hypercuts and Hypersplit. Because Hicuts and Hypercuts divides the rule sets by cutting the address space into equal-sized subspaces, their cutting efficiency is not good. Although Hypersplit proposed a good end-point-based cutting scheme, the resulting tree depth is still very high. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional cutting algorithm to significantly reduce the decision tree depth and a multi-layered scheme to dramatically reduce the usage of memory. Our experimental results show that the proposed layered scheme needs much less memory than Hypersplit for Firewall and IPC rule tables with a factor of 2 to 106 improvement while the proposed layered scheme needs a little more memory than Hypersplit for some of ACL tables. In addition, in terms of number of memory accesses, the proposed layered scheme and Hypercuts are better than Hicuts and Hypersplit for all tables while the proposed layered scheme is better than Hypercuts for ACL and Firewall tables. In terms of number of memory accesses, our layered cutting scheme and Hypercuts perform equally well for small rule tables. But, in larger rule tables, the proposed layered cutting scheme has better performance. © 2011 IEEE.

79960060940	A personalized service recommendation system in a home-care environment	Many bio-signals of the chronic patients could be measured by various bio-devices and transferred to back-end system over the wireless network through the homebox. In a home-care environment, it becomes more complex to reliably process transmitting and receiving these bio-signals by the homebox. While the bio-devices increasing, the process is even much more complex. In addition, the chronic patients always hope to be served correctly and suitably by the service system in the house. Therefore, we have to provide services such as adjusting room temperature and lighting etc to make those patients’ daily lives easy. In this paper, we propose a personalized service recommendation system (PSRS) based on users’ preferences and habits. The PSRS has capability of providing suitable services. Furthermore, we construct personal models to record the patients’ daily activities and habits. Through the models, the system will be able to automatically launch to safety alert, recommendable services and healthcare services in the house. In the future, the proposed system and models could even carry out the mobile health monitor and promotion in a home-care environment

79960073559	A self-adaptable indoor localization scheme for wireless sensor networks	Service systems used for various applications in home automation and security require estimating the locations precisely using certain sensors. Serving a mobile user automatically by sensing his/her locations in an indoor environment is considered as a challenge. However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the Global Positioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor environment has become popular. Some physical features have also been discussed to solve localization in WSNs. In this paper, we inquire into received signal strength indication (RSSI)-based solutions and propose a new localization scheme called the closer tracking algorithm (CTA) for indoor localization. Under the proposed CTA, a mechanism on mode-change is designed to switch automatically between the optimal approximately closer approach (ACA) and the real-time tracking (RTT) method according to pre-tuned thresholds. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to move reference nodes dynamically to reduce the uncovered area of the ACA for increasing the estimation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed CTA using ZigBee CC2431 modules. The experimental results show that the proposed CTA can determine the position accurately with an error distance less than 0.9 m. At the same time, the CTA scheme has at least 87% precision when the distance is less than 0.9 m. The proposed CTA can select an adaptive mode properly to improve the localization accuracy with high confidence. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the accuracy can be improved by the deployment and movement of reference nodes. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

79960873537	Multi-field range encoding for packet classification in TCAM	Packet classification has wide applications such as unauthorized access prevention in firewalls and Quality of Service supported in Internet routers. The classifier containing pre-defined rules is processed by the router for finding the best matching rule for each incoming packet and for taking appropriate actions. Although many software-based solutions had been proposed, high search speed required for Internet backbone routers is not easy to achieve. To accelerate the packet classification, the state-of-the-art ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is a promising solution. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-field range encoding scheme to solve the problem of storing ranges in TCAM and to decrease TCAM usage. Existing range encoding schemes are usually single-field schemes that perform range encoding processes in the range fields independently. Our performance experiments on real-life classifiers show that the proposed multi-field range encoding scheme uses less TCAM memory than the existing single field schemes. Compared with existing notable single-field encoding schemes, the proposed scheme uses 12% ∼ 33% of TCAM memory needed in DRIPE or SRGE and 56% ∼ 86% of TCAM memory needed in PPC for the classifiers of up to 10k rules. © 2011 IEEE.

84860703930	CubeCuts: A novel cutting scheme for packet classification	Packet Classification is one of the most important services provided by Internet routers nowadays. Decision-tree based schemes, such as HiCuts and Hyper Cuts, are the most well-known algorithms. These schemes separate search space into many equal-sized sub-spaces. But both schemes have the same rule replication problem, which might cause large memory overhead. Although another decision-tree based solution, Hyper splits, was proposed to cut space according to end-points for reducing the memory requirement, we still observe that its rule replication problem doesnt be solved well and the memory requirement can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Cube Cuts to build a binary decision tree that does not generate any duplicated rule. By using the hybrid scheme that combines the Cube Cuts and constrained HiCuts, we can have a memory-efficient data structure such that the entire rule table of up to10K rules can be fit into the on-chip memory of FPGA device. Our design is very suitable to be implemented with parallelism and pipeline. The experimental results show that the rule replication ratio is very low in all rule tables (ACL, FW, and IPC). The proposed parallel and pipelined architecture based on the hybrid scheme can achieve a throughput of 118 Gbps, which is enough to deal with the Internet traffic that is growing rapidly in recent years. © 2012 IEEE.

84860723475	Layer partitioned search tree for packet classification	Packet classification is an important building block of the Internet routers for many network applications. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Layer Partitioned Search Tree (LPST) to solve multi-field packet classification problem. LPST improves the traditional decision tree based schemes (e.g. Hyper Cuts and EffiCuts) by reconstructing the leaf nodes of the decision tree as an approximately balanced search tree. The rules may be stored not only in the buckets of leaf nodes but also in the internal nodes of LPST. Thus, searches on LPST may be completed immediately without searching all the buckets on the path to some leaf node if the packet already matches an internal node. The experimental results show that LPST requires less memory storage even if LPST categorizes the rules by two fields to reduce rule duplication rather than five fields in EffiCuts. Besides, in terms of number of memory accesses, LPST is better than Hyper Cuts and EffiCuts. © 2012 IEEE.

84882633066	Efficient gray-code-based range encoding schemes for packet classification in TCAM	An efficient ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) encoding scheme using a binary reflected Gray code (BRGC) and the concept of elementary intervals is presented for efficiently storing arbitrary ranges in TCAM. The proposed layered BRGC range encoding scheme (L-BRGC) groups ranges into BRGC range sets in which each range can be encoded into a single ternary vector. The results of experiments performed on real-life and synthesized rule tables show that L-BRGC consumes less TCAM than all the existing range encoding schemes for all rule tables, except that the direct conversion scheme (EIGC) using elementary intervals and BRGC codes performs best for a small real-life ACL rule table. © 1993-2012 IEEE.

84881057229	An efficient TCAM update scheme for packet classification	Ternary Content Address Memory (TCAM) becomes a popular hardware device for storing the packet classifiers due to the advantages of high and deterministic lookup performance. However, managing the filter set in TCAM is quite complicated when filters need to be updated. To ensure the correctness of search results, it is required to obtain the right position in TCAM for storing the new filter. In addition, some filters need to be moved to other positions for maintaining the correct filter overlapping relationship based on their priorities. Normally, an auxiliary data structure is used to compute how to insert or delete a filter into/from TCAM. However, this auxiliary data structure is usually complicated and large. Instead of maintaining an auxiliary data structure, in this paper, we propose an efficient TCAM update scheme that simply uses a very small portion of TCAM search cycles to compute how to move the filters related to the filter to be inserted or deleted. Therefore, a large amount of memory for storing the auxiliary data structure along with the local CPU for updates can be avoided. In addition, our simulation results show that the proposed update scheme needs less number of TCAM movements than the existing CoPTUA update scheme [2]. © 2013 IEEE.

84885178441	Hint-based cache design for reducing miss penalty in HBS packet classification algorithm	In this paper, we implement some notable hierarchical or decision-tree-based packet classification algorithms such as extended grid of tries (EGT), hierarchical intelligent cuttings (HiCuts), HyperCuts, and hierarchical binary search (HBS) on an IXP2400 network processor. By using all six of the available processing microengines (MEs), we find that none of these existing packet classification algorithms achieve the line speed of OC-48 provided by IXP2400. To improve the search speed of these packet classification algorithms, we propose the use of software cache designs to take advantage of the temporal locality of the packets because IXP network processors have no built-in caches for fast path processing in MEs. Furthermore, we propose hint-based cache designs to reduce the search duration of the packet classification data structure when cache misses occur. Both the header and prefix caches are studied. Although the proposed cache schemes are designed for all the dimension-by-dimension packet classification schemes, they are, nonetheless, the most suitable for HBS. Our performance simulations show that the HBS enhanced with the proposed cache schemes performs the best in terms of classification speed and number of memory accesses when the memory requirement is in the same range as those of HiCuts and HyperCuts. Based on the experiments with all the high and low locality packet traces, five MEs are sufficient for the proposed rule cache with hints to achieve the line speed of OC-48 provided by IXP2400. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84889028510	Dynamic virtual routers using multiway segment tree	Recently, research community has drawn lots of attentions in the router virtualization that allows multiple virtual router instances running on the same physical router platform. Thus, the virtualized router should be able to handle packets from different virtual networks. Once the multiple virtual routing tables are merged, memory requirement can be reduced due to the common entries among virtual routing tables. Many previous works use trie-based methods to merge the virtual routing tables. In this paper, we propose a range-based merging method. The data structure is based on the dynamic multiway segment tree (DMST) that is implemented with standard B-tree structure. As our experimental results show, faster lookup speed and incremental update can be achieved. The proposed method performs much better than the trie-based ones in lookup speed and scalability, and has similar memory consumption. © 2013 IEEE.

84893666877	Improved group-based cooperative caching scheme for mobile ad hoc networks	Data caching is a popular technique that improves data accessibility in wired or wireless networks. However, in mobile ad hoc networks, improvement in access latency and cache hit ratio may diminish because of the mobility and limited cache space of mobile hosts (MHs). In this paper, an improved cooperative caching scheme called group-based cooperative caching (GCC) is proposed to generalize and enhance the performance of most group-based caching schemes. GCC allows MHs and their neighbors to form a group, and exchange a bitmap data directory periodically used for proposed algorithms, such as the process of data discovery, and cache placement and replacement. The goal is to reduce the access latency of data requests and efficiently use available caching space among MH groups. Two optimization techniques are also developed for GCC to reduce computation and communication overheads. The first technique compresses the directories using an aggregate bitmap. The second employs multi-point relays to develop a forwarding node selection scheme to reduce the number of broadcast messages inside the group. Our simulation results show that the optimized GCC yields better results than existing cooperative caching schemes in terms of cache hit ratio, access latency, and average hop count. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84899075420	AN analysis of the root causes of defects injected into the software by the software team: An industrial study of the distributed health-care system	A root cause is a source of software defect, whose removal decreases or removes the defect. A root cause of software defect is injected into the software by software engineers during the development process. One of the main concerns of the software team leader, such as the project manager, is to determine who injected various root causes of the defects into the software and when these have been injected. In this paper, a cost-benefit scheme is presented, which allows a software team to determine skill weakness and improve team capability. The scheme provides effective in-process feedback based on the causal analysis of software defects. The proposed analysis scheme includes orthogonal root cause definitions, role-based root cause types, and gradational correction actions. In the experiment, the projects of a distributed health-care system are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The results show that the root cause ratios (RCR) are 33.8%, 30.6%, 21.9%, 10.7%, and 3.0% in design, implementation, analysis, business and deployment, respectively. The defects in the projects mainly occurred during the design and implementation phases of the projects. Correction activities to enhance the designers' skills, such as exception handling (40.5%) and DB/data schema (25.0%), are the top priorities that must be addressed by the software team. The findings can help the team leader to determine methods to improve these weaknesses. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84909638901	LayeredTrees: Most specific prefix-based pipelined design for on-chip IP address lookups	Multibit trie-based pipelines for IP lookups have been demonstrated to be able to achieve the throughput of over 100 Gbps. However, it is hard to store the entire multibit trie into the on-chip memory of reconfigurable hardware devices. Thus, their performance is limited by the speed of off-chip memory. In this paper, we propose a new pipeline design called LayeredTrees that overcomes the shortcomings of the multibit trie-based pipelines. LayeredTrees pipelines the multi-layered multiway balanced prefix trees based on the concept of most specific prefixes. LayeredTrees is optimized to fit the entire routing table into the on-chip memory of reconfigurable hardware devices. No prefix duplication is needed and each W-bit prefix is encoded in a (W + 1)-bit format to save memory. Assume the minimal packet size is 40 bytes. Our experimental results on Virtex-6 XC6VSX315T FPGA chip show that the throughputs of 33.6 and 120.8 Gbps can be achieved by the proposed single search engine and multiple search engines running in parallel, respectively. Furthermore, the impact of update operations on the search performance is minimal. With the same FPGA device, an IPv6 routing table of 290,503 distinct entries can also be supported.

84923912250	A method to diagnose self-weaknesses for software development organizations	A root cause is a source of a defect such that if it is removed, the defect is subsequently decreased or removed. By analyzing the root causes of defects of our software projects, we will be able to determine the weaknesses of our software development teams. We could thus decide on how much effort to be invested on specific actions to improve the weaknesses of the teams. In this paper, we first described how defects were objectively collected during project development. Second, the root causes were defined and categorized into six groups. Then we focused on analyzing defects to find out their root causes. Based on statistical results, the weaknesses of the project teams were determined. The results showed that the disturbing defects in our projects were mainly injected in the design phase, especially in the detail design phase. Moreover, we should invest considerable effort on enhancing our detail design skills, such as designing components, algorithms and interfaces, and so on. Some corrective actions and prevention proposals would correspondingly be acted upon and planned, respectively. Overall, we believe that our experiences and methods are worthy of sharing.
