84861658592	Geometry design and tooth contact analysis of crossed beveloid gears for marine transmissions	Beveloid gears, also known as conical gears, gain more and more importance in industry practice due to their abilities for power transmission between parallel, intersected and crossed axis. However, this type of gearing with crossed axes has no common plane of action which results in a point contact and low tooth durability. Therefore, a geometry design approach assuming line contact is developed to analyze the tooth engagement process of crossed beveloid gears with small shaft angle for marine transmission applications. The loaded gear tooth contact behavior is simulated by applying a quasi-static analysis to study the effects of gearing parameters on mesh characteristics. Using the proposed method, a series of sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of critical gearing parameters such as shaft angle, cone angle, helix angle and profile-shift coefficient on the theoretical gear mesh is performed. The parametric analysis of pitch cone design shows that the dominant design parameters represented by the angle between the first principle directions (FPD) and normal angular factor are more sensitive to the shaft and cone angles than they are to the helix angle. The theoretical contact path is highly sensitive to the profile-shift coefficient, which is determined from the theoretical tooth contact analysis. The FPD angle is found to change the distribution of contact pattern, contact pressure and root stress as well as the translational transmission error and the variation of the mesh stiffness significantly. The contact pattern is clearly different between the drive and coast sides due to different designed FPD angles. Finally, a practical experimental setup for marine transmission is performed and tooth bearing test is conducted to demonstrate the proposed design procedure. The experimental result compared well with the simulation. Results of this study yield a better understanding of the geometry design and loaded gear mesh characteristics for crossed beveloid gears used in marine transmission. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

The effects of gearing parameters on the angle between the first principle directions are analyzed. The loaded tooth contact analysis is performed using FEM theory. The conclusion indicates that: the angle between the first principle directions is more sensitive to cone angles than to the helix angle. The increase of the angle between the first principle directions can obtain smaller contact area, higher transmission error and lower mesh stiffness. A practical tooth bearing test is conducted to demonstrate the proposed design procedure and the experimental result compared well with the simulation. For the matching design and optimization of beveloid gears, it has both the theoretical and project practical significance.

84877846890	A thermal finite line contact EHL model of a helical gear pair	A thermal finite line contact elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) model is developed to study lubricated contact performance of a helical gear pair. Three typical engagement positions during a meshing cycle, i.e. the engage-in position, the engage-out position and the pitch point position are chosen to show effect of load, speed, and addendum modification on pressure distribution, film profile, temperature field, etc. Results show temperature rise increases as the load or the speed goes up. The temperature distribution when the gear pair engaging around the pitch point behaves like a V-shape with higher values at the end parts. For the case with a standard center distance, proper addendum modification, i.e., negative modification for the bigger gear and positive modification for the small gear is good for improving lubrication performance and the service life of the helical gear drive. © IMechE 2012.

62949246848	Feedrate scheduling and jerk control algorithm for high-speed CNC machining	High-speed CNC machining usually slows down around corners and vibrates so much because of limits on processing large amount of consecutive small line blocks with high speed and inability changing directions fast enough. Aiming at adjusting the feedrate automatically and providing smoother acceleration to achieve maximum productivity, this research presents a feedrate scheduling and jerk control interpolation algorithm to seek the optimal feedrate by evaluating the tool path ahead. After generating a smooth path within error allowance by B-spline fitting algorithm, we calculate the safe, highest, continuous linear velocity while simultaneously accommodating the machine's Acceleration/ Deceleration (Acc/Dec) limits. Smooth jerk motion is obtained by modulating the acceleration profiles along the tool path. A look-ahead interpolation scheme is also presented for the purpose of fast controls. Simulation results indicate that the proposed adaptive algorithm speeds feedrates, limits distortion to the programmed path, maintains high speed without sacrificing accuracy while going around corners.

This model is used in spur gear applications to comprehensively show effects of roughness, working conditions, i.e., rotational speeds and loads on pressure ripples and severity of asperity contacts. Results show effects of the speed, the load, as well as the RMS value are coupled which makes it difficult to evaluate lubrication states by only considering one variable. Considering the Ree-Eyring non-Newtonian behavior could alleviate pressure ripples significantly, compared with the Newtonian fluid assumption.

84862668250	Stretch rate and deformation for pre-stretching aluminum alloy sheet	Numerical simulation combined with experimental test was carried out to analyze the pre-stretching process of the 7075 aluminum alloy sheet, from which the stress variation curves and residual stress of aluminum alloy sheet in different stretch rates were obtained. The results show that the residual stress in length direction is released after unloading the stretch force, while the residual stress in width direction is released during the stretching process. The study of residual stress elimination is beneficial for optimizing stretch rate on the basis of residual stress distribution law. By comparing the variation principle of residual stress in length direction, the size range of three deformation areas and elimination percentage of residual stress were obtained. The residual stresses of clamping area and transition area are not eliminated effectively, so sawing quantity should be the sum of both the areas. The elimination rate of residual stress in even deformation area could reach 90% after choosing a proper stretch rate, which is verified by both simulation and experiment. © 2012 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84863600512	Effects of assembly errors on crossed beveloid gear tooth contact and dynamic response	It is known that the tooth flank geometry, assembly errors and the operating conditions of a gear pair have significant influence on tooth contact, load distribution and dynamic response. However, the study of the effects of assembly errors on the mesh characteristics and dynamic response for crossed beveloid gears has been limited due to the complicated geometry and time-varying mesh characteristics. In this study, three types of assembly errors including shaft angle, offset and gear axial position error are examined based on a synthesized mesh model and a three-dimensional elastically coupled rigidbody dynamic model. Also, the relation between a dominant geometry design parameter that is the crossed angle between the first principal directions of the tooth surface curvatures (FPD-angle) and the sensitivity of mesh characteristics and dynamic response subject to assembly errors is investigated. Through the sensitivity analysis with different FPD-angles, the shaft angle error is found to be the most sensitive factor affecting the mesh and dynamic behaviors of crossed beveloid gear set. On the other hand, the gear axial position errors have the least influence on the mesh characteristics and dynamic response. In most cases, the influences of assembly errors on mesh characteristics and dynamics become weaker with the increase of FPD-angle. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.

The main structural parameters of a CVT evidently affect the driving performance of the vehicle. The effect of one main structural parameter, namely the masses of the flyweights utilized, on the governing characteristics of the CVT is studied, and the mechanism of the effect is explained. First, a mechanical analysis of the drive pulley and the driven pulley of a rubber-belt CVT employed on a snowmobile is conducted. Through the theoretical analysis, the mathematical model of the system running in a steady state is built. Then the principle of parameter optimization, the running resistance of the vehicle, as well as the external characteristics of the gasoline engine applied in the snowmobile are investigated. Finally, experimental research on the structural tuning based on the building of a CVT test rig is carried out. Since it is difficult to change the parameters of some components such as the torque cam and the profile line of the flyweights, the masses of the flyweights are considered as the unique design variables, and different regulating characteristics of the available groups are obtained. Different applications accordingly require corresponding structural design schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed parameter-tuning principle is theoretically correct and practically feasible, which makes it useful for guidance in designing the CVT, as well as the whole driveline. © 2010 Authors.

84878118158	Sliding friction effect on dynamics of crossed beveloid gears with small shaft angle	We propose a new method of incorporating the gear sliding friction model and loaded mesh model into an analytical nonlinear crossed beveloid geared vibration model to evaluate the mesh and dynamic characteristics. A 3-dimensional quasi-static loaded tooth contact analysis is employed and the derivation of distributed sliding friction forces and synthesis of frictions to the effective form is applied in the nonlinear dynamic analysis. Using the proposed method, the excitation effects of frictions on tooth mesh and dynamic responses at different load levels are found and investigated. The analysis results show that the existence of sliding frictions between the engaged teeth indeed tends to affect the contact pattern, normal load distribution and maximum contact pressure, but it is unsubstantial. The torque load effect of friction is found with greater degressive influence on mesh stiffness and transmission error at heavier load case. The magnitude and directionality of sliding friction on effective total engaged teeth exhibit less obvious variations than on each tooth due to the contributions from multiple teeth effect. Also, friction excitations tend to decrease the dynamic mesh force slightly for both light and heavy load cases. © 2013 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84908363813	Pitch cone design and tooth contact analysis of intersected beveloid gears for marine transmission	A pitch cone based geometry design method considering line contact is proposed for intersected beveloid gears. The proposed pitch cone design applies the spatial gearing model to determine working pitch cone angles and working spiral angles. For the determination of geometry design parameters, a computer program which incorporates pitch cone design and line contact condition was developed. To illustrate the meshing characteristics, example studies with three groups of geometry parameters were performed by unloaded and loaded tooth contact analysis. Through the analysis, the influences of misalignments, torque load and angle between the first principal directions of the tooth surface curvatures (FPD-angle) on the mesh were investigated. The results show that: compared with axial position errors, shaft angle errors have a more detrimental influence on both the contact path and transmission error. Both FPD-angle and torque load have an obvious effect on this type of gearing. Finally, a practical experimental setup for intersected beveloid gearing with small shaft angle was performed and loaded tooth bearing tests were conducted to demonstrate the proposed design procedure and the theoretical simulation models. The experimental results compared well with the simulation.

84920537428	Numerical analysis of elastohydrodynamic lubrication for cycloid drives	Numerical analysis of grease elastohydrodynamic lubrication for cycloid drives was performed. The minimum film thickness of meshing process was obtained. Comparting it with that obtained from an empirical formula, the correctness of model was verified. The average radius of cycloid wheel's lubrication state was taken as the judgment basis, the effects of rotating speed, load and rheological index on grease EHL were analyzed. Results showed that with increase in rotating speed, the second pressure peak drops and moves toward the inlet, the film thickness increases; with increase in load, the contact field width increases, the second pressure peak rises and moves toward the out let, the film thickness decreases slightly; with increase in the rhoological index n, the second pressure peak firstly increases and then decreases, finally approaches Hertz pressure, and it moves toward the outlet, the film thickness decreases. The effect of the short ampliitude coefficient k
