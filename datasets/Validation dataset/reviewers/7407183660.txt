84928914620	Effect of ultrasonic vibration on microstructure of Mg-RE-Zn-Y cast alloys	The Rare Earth (RE) containing Mg cast alloys have big potential to be used for heat-resistant applications, on condition that the RE-containing intermetallic compounds can be refined during the casting process. In this research, the effect of Ultrasonic Vibration (USV) with different powers on microstructure and mechanical properties of the semi-solid Mg-3RE-3Zn-0.7Y alloys has been investigated. The Mg alloy melt at temperature of 20-40 °C above the liquidus was exposed to USV for 90 s with different powers from 800W to 1200W, and the USV ended about 10°C below the liquidus. The results show that good semi-solid slurry with fine and spherical α-Mg particles could be obtained, and the primary α-Mg crystals are with average particle size of 55 μm and average shape coefficient of 0.63 after USV with 1000 W power. After USV treatment with the a power of 1000 W, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the casting samples were 25.2% and 93.5% higher than those of the samples without USV treatment respectively. It can be concluded that ultrasonic vibration is a good method to prepare semi-solid slurry of Mg alloy with fine and relatively round primary crystals due to cavitation and acoustic streaming effects.

8844237759	Performance of semi-solid slurry produced by twin-screw stirring mixer and rheo-diecasting process of AZ91D alloy	The microstructure of semi-solid slurry of AZ91D alloy, which was produced by twin-screw stirring mixer under the different parameters, was investigated. Rheoforming by cold chamber die casting process was performed thereafter. The results indicate that with decreasing of the barrel temperature of the mixer and the pouring temperature of molten Mg alloy, the solid fraction of semi-solid slurry increases and the size of non-dendritic grains becomes smaller. While the shear rate increases, the solid fraction of semi-solid slurry decreases. The tensile strength and elongation of metal rheoformed by die casting are higher by about 37% and 44% respectively than those produced by conventional liquid die casting.

1942540661	Modification mechanism of hypereutectic Al-Si alloy with P-Na addition	Effect of P-Na united modification on Al-22%Si-l.0%Cu-0.5%Mg-0.5%Mn alloy was studied. The results show that the refining effect of P-Na addition on primary silicon is superior to that of P and the former could modify eutectic silicon at the same time. Effects of P-Na modification on crystallization and microstructure of hypereutectic Al-Si alloys were studied with Electron-Scanning Microscope, Electron-Prohe and X-ray diffractometer. The modification mechanism represents that on one hand, the primary silicon is refined by A1P as heterogeneous nucleus; on the other hand, when Na is added at the same time, P atoms are difficult to diffuse in the melt, and then enriches on the growing faces of silicon phase. Moreover, a SiP compound was also discovered in Si crystals, which prevents the growth of silicon phase and refines the primary silicon.

The experimental results showed that the fluorinated block copolymers exhibited higher surface activity in N-methyl pyrrolidone solutions than in aqueous solutions. Interestingly, the surface tensions of aqueous solutions for sodium salt systems are nearly the same, resulting from the aggregation behavior of sodium salts of PSSF in water.

0009035170	Engulfment of Al2O3 particles during solidification of aluminum matrix composites	Through the analysis of forces acting on the particles at the solid/liquid interface based on the interfacial energies, we propose a new theoretical particle transfer model. This model can predict the behavior of the particles at the interface. The main concept of this model is proved by the mutual wetting behavior among the solid, liquid and particle phases. If the contact angle at a solid/liquid interface and a particle is <90°, the particle can be engulfed into the solid, and if the contact angle is >90°, the particle would be pushed. This contact angle is measured by unidirectional solidification (UDS) experiments. But if solidification experiments were carried out for particle dispersed composites in a conventional UDS, the particles completely descended before freezing, therefore, a zone-UDS was used in the experiment.

27744557263	Preparation and characterization of polysiloxane-modified epoxy resin aqueous dispersions and their films	Polysiloxane-modified epoxy resin aqueous dispersions were prepared by the reaction of amino-polysiloxane (APS) with a graft epoxy resin that was synthesized with a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A type epoxy resin and styrene/acrylic acid. The measurements of the epoxy values and FTIR spectra confirmed that this reaction really took place. The modified aqueous dispersion exhibits high viscosity, small particle size, and nearly the same surface tension as the unmodified one. Therefore, this indicates that the siloxane segments could be encapsulated into graft epoxy resin particles during the water dispersion process. For APS-modified films, the thermal stability and water resistance are remarkably enhanced. Furthermore, lowering of the hardness and surface tension for these films was also observed and the surface composition was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The experimental data indicate that the siloxane segments easily migrate onto the surface during the film formation process and finally enrich on the surface of the APS-modified film. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Properties of the modified aqueous dispersions and their films were studied. The modification resulted in dispersions of smaller particles, broader ranges of particle size, and higher viscosity. Observations by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) showed that polysiloxane was wrapped by the epoxy resin to form a 'core-shell' structure. The water and oil repellency as well as the heat resistance of the modified film were significantly improved; the surface energy of the films was lowered. TEM photographs of the modified films suggested that the polysiloxane particles reoriented and migrated to the film surface during the film formation. Results of ATR (attenuated total refraction) and FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrum measurements confirmed the enrichment of polysiloxane on the modified surface film.

33644650154	Adsorption of poly(urethane-urea-amine) acetate on colloidal silica	The adsorption of water-soluble cationic poly(urethane-urea-amine) acetate (PUUA) on colloidal silica as aqueous dispersion was studied. The results indicated that the conformation of the PUUA chains was in stretched conformation in dilute solution, and the average molecular size was smaller than the diameter of silica particles. The adsorption of PUUA onto the colloidal silica was attributed to van der Waals' and hydrogen bonding forces. The adsorption isotherms revealed that, after stable adsorption on the surface of silica particle, the adsorption amount of PUUA linearly increased, moreover, there was not an ultimate saturated adsorption. The apparent adsorption was linearly, by the same slope, decreased with increase of the colloidal silica size, falling of the surface charges of silica, and increase of the amount of sodium acetate added. Furthermore, the adsorption was ascended with increasing molecular weight of PUUA, and the adsorption of the large molecules was prior to the small molecules of PUUA. The electrostatic attraction was the predominant effect on the adsorption of the PUUA from water onto the colloidal silica. The apparent viscosity of the dispersion was decreased by the adsorption of the PUUA-E onto the colloidal silica. The sensitivity of the dispersions showed pseudoplastic flow, while the protection of the dispersions displayed dilatancy.

33645104156	A chromium-free conversion coating of magnesium alloy by a phosphate-permanganate solution	A chromium-free conversion coating for AZ91D magnesium alloy has been obtained by using a phosphate-permanganate solution, which has been developed out without acid pickling. Examinations have been carried out on the conversion coatings for morphology, composition, adhesion force, and corrosion resistance. Results show that the conversion coatings are relatively uniform and continuous, with thickness from 7 μm to 10 μm. They demonstrate good adhesion to matrix and have some non-penetrating tiny holes on the surface. The main elements of the conversion coating of AZ91D alloy are Mg, O, P, K, Al and Mn by EPMA analysis. Results of corrosion resistance test indicate that the corrosion resistance of the conversion coating by phosphate-permanganate solution is matched to that of the conversion coating by traditional chromate solution, but for the corrosion resistance after painting, the former is better than the later. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33745738886	Fluorinated polyacrylate emulsion and surface properties of their films	Perfluoro octylacyloxyethyl methacrylate (FA) was synthesized and used in emulsion copolymerization with acrylates. The anionic emulsions of the copolymer were produced by semi continuing feed, and the range of the latex particle was in 120~130 nm. The surface properties of the latex film formed by casting were studied. The results show that the water absorption of the film is decreased with increasing of FA, but the water permeability of the film is not affected by the addition of the FA. The properties of the fluorinated polyacrylates film can be improved by post-heated. The water contact angle of the film processed at 120°C is enhanced with increasing the content of FA. Furthermore, the enrichment of the fluorinated group on the film surface is increased one more times, if the film is processed at 160°C, and the surface free energy of the film can be decreased one more times, the water contact angle of the film surface can also be increased four times. The results of the heat process also show that the heat time can be shortened by increasing the heat temperature. The roughness of the polyacrylates film surface is augmented with addition of the FA and introduction of the heat process. The water-and oil-repellent of the film surface is much improved by fluorine enrichment and roughness increase.

The scanning electron microscope was used for the analysis of sample worn surface configuration and determination of wear mechanism. The results show that when the rotating speed is 0.618 m/s and the load varies in 20 to 250N respectively, the wear rate and friction coefficient of magnesium alloy enhances with raising the load, and the wear loss mass reduces instead when the load arrives at 250N. The wear loss of Mg alloy enhances in linearity proportion with the load, while the friction coefficient of Mg alloy is varied in 0.22 to 0.235.

84870983209	Rapid preparation of ceramic mould for medium-sized superalloy castings with magnesia-phosphate-bonded bauxite-mullite investments	Phosphate-bonded investments have already been widely utilized in dental restoration and micro-casting of artistic products for its outstanding rapid setting and high strength. However, the rapid setting rate of investments slurry has up to now been a barrier to widespread use of such slurry in medium-sized ceramic mould preparing. This paper proposed a new process of rapid fabricating magnesia-phosphate-bonded investments ceramic mould for medium-sized superalloy castings utilizing bauxite and mullite as refractory aggregates. A series of experiments for magnesia-phosphate-bonded bauxite-mullite investments (MPBBMI) properties were conducted, including modifying the workable time of slurry by liquid (mL)/powder (g) (UP) ratio and adding boric acid as retard agent; sodium tri-polyphosphate (STP) as strengthening agent and bauxite (g)Imullite (g) (B/M) ratio for mechanical strength; Mechanical vibration was applied to improve initial setting time and fluidity when pouring investments slurry; then a intermediate size ceramic mould for superalloy castings was manufactured by means of this rapid preparing process with MPBBMI material. The results showed that the MPBBMI slurry exhibit proper initial setting time and excellent fluidity when UP ratio is 0.64, boric acid content is O. 88 wt%; the fired specimens made from MPBBMI material indicated enough compression strength to withstand impact force of molten metal when the B/M ratio is O. 89, STP content is 0.92 wt%; the experimental results confirmed feasibility of the proposed rapid fabricating process for medium-sized ceramic mould with MPBBMI material by appropriate measures.

84872280755	Microstructural characteristics of Al-20Si-2Cu-0.4Mg-1Ni alloy formed by rheo-squeeze casting after ultrasonic vibration treatment	A swash plate for air conditioning compressor of cars was formed by rheo-squeeze casting with semi-solid Al-Si alloy slurry prepared by ultrasonic vibration process, and the microstructure of this alloy was investigated. Besides the microstructures of primary Si particles and α(Al)+β-Si eutectic phases, non-equilibrium α(Al) particles or dendrites are discovered in the microstructure of the Al-20Si-2Cu-0.4Mg-1Ni alloy. Rapid cooling generated by squeeze casting process rather than the pressure is considered as the main reason for the formation of non-equilibrium α(Al) phase. The sound pressurizing effect of ultrasonic vibration also enables the non-equilibrium α(Al) phases to form above eutectic temperature and grow into non-dendritic spheroids in the process of semi-solid slurry preparation. Non-equilibrium α(Al) phases formed in the hypereutectic Al-Si alloy with ultrasonic vibration treatment, consist of round α(Al) grains formed above the eutectic temperature and a small amount of fine α(Al) dendrites formed under the eutectic temperature. The volume fraction of primary Si particles is decreased significantly by the effect of ultrasonic vibration through increasing the solid solubility of Si atoms in α(Al) matrix and decreasing the forming temperature range of primary Si particles. The average particle diameter and the volume fraction of primary Si particles in microstructure of the swash-plate by rheo-squeeze casting are 24.3 μm and 11.1%, respectively. © 2012 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The new equipment is made up of three independent furnaces including holding furnace, pressurizing furnace and up-stream furnace. The three furnaces are connected by the paths located in the bottom of the furnace. Refilling, pressurizing, pouring are fulfilled by the three furnaces, respectively. Pressurizing furnace possesses constant liquid volume and liquid level is kept at the same height before air pressurizing. So the air pressure curve is accurate and stable, and good reproducibility can be achieved for each pouring. Interruption between refilling and pouring through holding furnace can't observed.

The viscosity of Al-17Si-xFe in the constant temperatures of 100°C, 50°C above the liquidus and 10°C, 40°C below the liquidus, respectively, was measured, and the viscosity - temperature curve in the continuous cooling process was presented. The results show that the viscosities in the previous temperatures reaches 0.7451, 0.7878, 0.9224, 1.0829 Pa · s, respectively, which show with the temperature decreases, the viscosity is increased. With the iron content increasing from 2% to 4%, the viscosity of the alloys is increased too. However, with a higher iron content, the precipitation and sedimentation of the iron phases becomes serious in the temperature of 40°C below the liquidus with increasing in the holding time, which results in the decrease of the apparent viscosity of the melt to some extent. With increasing in the shearing time, the apparent viscosity of the alloys in the temperature of 40°C below the liquidus is decreased firstly and then increased. In the continuous cooling process, with the continuous decrease of the temperature, the solid fraction of the melt is gradually increased, and the apparent viscosity of the melt is increased slowly. When the temperature is reduced to some temperature near the solidus, the apparent viscosity of Al-17Si-xFe alloys is increased rapidly. In addition, at the same shear rate and to achieve the same solid fraction, the apparent viscosity of the melt is increased with the increase of cooling rate.

Spherical primary α-Al particles were uniformly dispersed in the matrix and presented a bimodal distribution of grain sizes. The effects of rheo-squeeze casting (RSC) parameters such as squeeze pressure and solid fraction on the microstructure and tensile properties of the semisolid alloy were investigated. The results indicate that average diameters of the primary α-Al particles decreased with the increase of squeeze pressure, while the tensile properties of the alloy increased. With the increase of solid fraction, the tensile strength increased first and then decreased, but the elongation decreased continuously. The best tensile properties were achieved when the slurry with a solid fraction of 0.17 solidified under 100 MPa.

In order to avoid this problem, a slurry-making process with indirect ultrasonic vibration (IUV), in which the horn is vibrated under the outside of the metallic cup containing alloy melt, has been developed in this research. Semisolid slurry of A356 Al alloy was prepared by this process, and the effects of IUV treatment time on the morphology of the primary α-Al phase and mechanical properties of rheo-diecasting samples were studied. The results indicate that excellent semisolid slurry of A356 Al alloy could be obtained within 50s by applying IUV near its liquidus temperature, and the average diameter and shape coefficient of the primary α-Al particles were 75μm and 0.62, respectively. IUV treatment time had a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the rheo-diecasting samples, and samples treated by IUV for 50s had the maximum tensile strength and elongation. The maximum as-cast tensile strength and elongation were 244MPa and 7.5% respectively, which were increased by 10% and 75% respectively compared to conventional molten-melt die-casting samples.

The volume fraction of Co-bearing intermetallic compounds was increased with the increasing of Co content when various levels of Co (from 0% to 1.5%) added respectively into the alloys whether they formed in traditional casting or with USV treatment. The Co-bearing compounds presented as Chinese script or granular when Co was equal or less than 0.7% and turned into dendritic or fish-bone shape when Co was more than 0.7%. USV treatment applied around liquidus temperature of the melt could lead to a refinement of Co-containing compounds by promoting nucleus formation, hindering preferential growth on certain direction, and enlarging solute diffusion coefficient.

Good semi-solid slurry can be produced by high-intensity UV process for aluminum alloys. The microstructures of Al-Si, Al-Mg and Al-Cu alloys produced by rheocasting assisted with UV are compact and with fine grains. The mechanical properties of the UV treated alloys are increased by about 20%-30%. Grain refinement of the alloys is generally considered because of cavitation and acoustic streaming caused by UV. Apart from these mechanisms, a hypothesis of the fuse of dendrite root caused by capillary infiltration in the ultrasonic field, as well as a mechanism of crystallites falling off from the mould-wall and crystal multiplication by mechanical vibration effect in indirect ultrasonic vibration are proposed to explain the microstructure evolution of the alloys.

However, there has been few work devoted to study the wear behavior of the hypereutectic Al-Si alloys with 2% or 3% Fe (mass %). In this work, the semi-solid slurry of the alloy was prepared by an ultrasonic vibration (USV) process. The effect of Fe content on dry sliding wear properties of the alloys rheo-casted after USV treatment was investigated. The wear tests were carried out using a pin-on-disc wear tester at four different loads of 50N, 100N, 150N and 200N at a constant sliding speed of 0.75m/s. The results show that the wear rate of USV treated alloy increases almost linearly as the applied load increases from 50 N to 200N. The alloys made with semi-solid process exhibited improved wear resistance at the entire applied load range in comparison to the conventional casting alloys. At the applied load of 50N, oxidative wear is the dominant mechanism for the alloys with USV treatment. At 200N, a combination of delamination and oxidation wear is the main wear mechanism. The wear resistance of Al-17Si alloys containing 2% to 3% Fe is closely related to the morphology, size and volume fraction of Fe-bearing compounds, which can be changed by USV semi-solid process.
