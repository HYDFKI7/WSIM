33745513642	Improvement of the Thermostability of Xylanase by N-terminus Replacement	The hybrid xylanase TB was constructed by the substitution of the N-terminus segment of the Streptomyces olivaceoviridis xylanase XYNB with the corresponding region of Thermomonospora fusca xylanase TfxA. The hybrid gene tb, encoding the TB, was correctly expressed in E. coli BL21 and Pichia pastoris GS115. The TB was purified and its enzymatic properties were determined. The results revealed that the optimal temperature and optimal pH of TB were at 70 °C and 6.0, which have been obviously improved compared with those of XYNB. The thermostability of the TB was all about six-fold of XYNB' s after incubating the properly diluted enzyme solutions at 80 °C and 90 °C for 3 min, respectively. The pH stability of TB was 5-9 (pH range in which the relative activity was above 50 %), which was narrower than that of XYNB. Still, TB remains a high specific activity, as does XYNB. Analysis of a homology modeling and sequence similarity were used to reveal the factors influencing the enzymatic properties of TB and the relationship between structure and function of xylanase was discussed. © 2006 Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Society for Microbiology.

F63 CGMCC 1669 and expression in Pichia pastoris	An extracellular α-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) from Penicillium sp. F63 CGMCC 1669, designated Agl1, was purified to homogeneity by means of fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with a molecular mass of 82 kDa on SDS-PAGE while 330 kDa on native gradient PAGE. Based on the partial amino acid sequences of the purified protein, Agl1 gene encoding the α-galactosidase was cloned and sequenced.

To achieve high-level expression of recombinant glucanase in Pichia pastoris, we designed sequences encoding the α-factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the truncated 1,3-1,4-β-d-glucanase from Fibrobacter succinogenes as a whole. The codons encoding the 52 amino acids of the signal peptide and 106 residues of the glucanase protein were optimized for expression in P. pastoris; 189 nucleotides were changed. The G + C content was adjusted to 48-49%, and AT-rich stretches were eliminated to avoid premature termination. The messenger ribonucleic acid secondary structure near the AUG start codon was also adjusted to ensure efficient translation; the resulting glucanase production was twofold higher compared with that achieved with gene structure optimization alone. We also propose a new fermentation strategy for the induction phase, in which 5/95% glycerol/methanol mixed feed was used in days 1-3 and 100% methanol was used on days 4-6. By comparison with methanol feed and glycerol/methanol-mixed feed alone, the yield of recombinant glucanase increased by 38.5 and 16.5%, respectively.

A synergistic (3-fold) increase in guar gum hydrolysis was observed when β-mannanase Man5A from Bispora sp. MEY-1 and r-AgalB were combined. Further, an increase in the reaction time from 5. h to 12. h or increase of the temperature from 37°C to 55°C enhanced guar gum degradation by the enzyme combination.

80052625513	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SGNH arylesterase from the goat rumen contents	An esterase-encoding gene, estR5, was directly obtained from the genomic DNA of goat rumen contents. The 555-bp full-length gene encodes a 184-residue polypeptide (EstR5) without putative signal peptide. Deduced EstR5 shared the highest identity (50%) to a putative arylesterase from Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that EstR5 was closely related with microbial esterases of gastrointestinal source. A comparison of the conserved motifs shared with GDSL proteins revealed that EstR5 could be grouped into the GDSL family and was further classified into the subfamily of SGNH hydrolases. The gene estR5 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Recombinant EstR5 exhibited highest catalytic efficiency towards α-naphthyl acetate followed by phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate and had no activity towards PNP esters with acyl chains longer than C8. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at around 60°C and pH 8.0, was stable at pH ranging from 6.0 to 11.0 and was slightly activated by detergent Tween, Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100. These properties suggest that EstR5 has great potential for basic research and industrial applications.

Both the recombinant phytases had high activity at pH 1.5-6.0 (optimum pH 4.5) with an optimum temperature of 55°C. Compared with the major commercial phytases from Aspergillus niger, Escherichia coli, and a potential commercial phytase from Y. intermedia, the Y. rohdei phytase was more resistant to pepsin, retained more activity under gastric conditions, and released more inorganic phosphorus (two to ten times) from soybean meal under simulated gastric conditions. These superior properties suggest that the Y. rohdei phytase is an attractive additive to animal feed. Our study indicated that, in order to better hydrolyze the phytate and release more inorganic phosphorus in the gastric passage, phytase should have high activity and stability, simultaneously, at low pH and high protease concentration. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

62149115657	Diversity of beta-propeller phytase genes in the intestinal contents of grass carp provides insight into the release of major phosphorus from phytate in nature	Phytate is the most abundant organic phosphorus compound in nature, and microbial mineralization of phytate by phytase is a key process for phosphorus recycling in the biosphere. In the present study, beta-propeller phytase (BPP) gene fragments were readily amplified from the intestinal contents of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) directly or from phytate-degrading isolates from the same source, confirming the widespread occurrence of BPP in aquatic communities. The amounts of sequences collected using these two methods differed (88 distinct genes versus 10 isolates), but the sequences showed the same general topology based on phylogenetic analysis. All of the sequences fell in five clusters and were distinct from those of Anabaena, Gloeobacter, Streptomyces, Flavobacterium, Prosthecochloris, and Desulfuromonas, which have never been found in the grass carp intestine. Analysis of the microbial diversity by denaturing gradient gel electro-phoresis demonstrated that unculturable bacteria were dominant bacteria in the grass carp intestine and thus the predominant phytate-degrading organisms. The predominant cultured species corresponding to the phytate-degrading isolates, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Shewanella species, might be the main source of known BPPs. A phytase from Brevundimonas was first obtained from cultured species. Combining our results with Lim et al.'s inference that phytate-mineralizing bacteria are widely distributed and highly diverse in nature (B. L. Lim, P. Yeung, C. Cheng, and J. E. Hill, ISME J. 1:321-330, 2007), we concluded that BPP is the major phytate-degrading enzyme in nature, that most of this enzyme might originate from unculturable bacteria, and that the distribution of BPP may be related to the type of niche. To our knowledge, this is the first study to experimentally estimate BPP diversity in situ. © 2009, American Society tor Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

The full-length gene consists of 1,434 bp and encodes 477 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide of 41 residues at its N-terminus. The mature xylanase comprises two functional domains, a family 10 glycoside hydrolase, and a family 13 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), which were joined by a short Gly/Pro-rich linker region. The intact, the CBM-truncated and the CBM-linker-truncated versions of the mature proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and subsequently characterized. XynAS27 showed high pH stability over the pH range 2.2-12.0. XynAS27 may be a compelling tool for the food industry because it generates xylobiose (85% w/w) as the main product of xylan hydrolysis. The truncated versions showed less pH and thermal stability, and less affinity and hydrolytic activity to insoluble substrate than the intact one. These results indicate that the CBM of XynAS27 plays a key role in the hydrolysis of insoluble substrate, and the CBM and linker region are also important for the enzyme stability, and the linker region contributes more. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

67650806136	Improvement of Yersinia frederiksenii phytase performance by a single amino acid substitution	A new phytase (APPA) with optimum pH 2.5-substantially lower than that of most of microbial phytases (pH 4.5-6.0)-was cloned from Yersinia frederiksenii and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Containing the highly conserved motifs typical of histidine acid phosphatases, APPA has the highest identity (84%) to the Yersinia intermedia phytase (optimal pH 4.5), a member of histidine acid phosphatase family. Based on sequence alignment and molecular modeling of APPA and related phytases, APPA has only one divergent residue, Ser51, in close proximity to the catalytic site. To understand the acidic adaptation of APPA, five mutants (S51A, S51T, S51D, S51K, and S51I) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in E. coli, purified, and characterized. Mutants S51T and S51I exhibited a shift in the optimal pH from 2.5 to 4.5 and 5.0, respectively, confirming the role of Ser51 in defining the optimal pH. Thus, a previously unrecognized factor other than electrostatics - presumably the side-chain structure near the active site - contributes to the optimal pH for APPA activity. Compared with wild-type APPA, mutant S51T showed higher specific activity, greater activity over pH 2.0-5.5, and increased thermal and acid stability. These properties make S51T a better candidate than the wild-type APPA for use in animal feed. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

67651167199	Mutation research on Q23L and Q23LG272E in phytase derivated from Aspergillus fumigatus	Aspergillus fumigatus wild-type phytase has many favorable properties, such as a good thermorstability and a broad pH optimum. However, the specific activity of the enzyme is relative low. A. fumigatus Q23L phytase resulted in a remarkable increase in specific activity around pH4.5~7.0, but the pH stability of Q23L was lower than A. fumigatus wild-type phytase. To increase the pH stability of Q23L, the mutant Q23LG272E was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with PCR. The gene of A. fumigatus wild-type phytase and the mutant genes encoding the Q23LG272E and the Q23L were correctly expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Enzymes were purified and their enzymatic properties were determined. The results revealed that the specific activity of the Q23L improved remarkably, which increased from 51 u/mg of the wild type to 109 u/mg at pH5.5. Meanwhile, the pH stability of Q23L decreased evidently, especially from pH3.0 to pH4.0.The pH stability of Q23LG272E in pH3.0~4.5 and pH6.5~7.0 has been improved compared with Q23L. The specific activity of Q23LG272E basically maintained at the level of Q23L.Analysis of 3-D structure and sequence similarity were used to reveal the presumable factors influencing the enzymatic properties of Q23LG272E, and discussion for the relationship between structure and function of phytase was given.

Based on the polyketide synthase gene (PKS4) sequences of four zearalenone-producing Fusarium strains, a specific primer set was designed and used to detect and quantify zearalenone-producing Fusarium in foodstuff. The system developed under study required only 100 mg infected maize flour for test, had ability to detect down to 10 copies of the target gene per reaction, and produced reliable quantitative data over three orders of magnitude. Compared with the conventional methods, it is more rapid, specific and sensitive to detect potential zearalenone contamination in food or feed production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two internal peptides of CelA4 showed strong sequence identity to the Allcyclobacillus acldocaldarlus cellulase precursor and contained the conserved domain and catalytic region of glycoside hydrolase family 51β-1,4-glucanases, and the N-terminal and three other internal peptides had no close glucanase or cellulase relatives, suggesting that the enzyme might be novel.

77955629331	Direct and efficient cloning of full-length genes from environmental DNA by RT-qPCR and modified TAIL-PCR	Environmental DNA (eDNA) is defined as the total DNA that can be isolated from environmental samples. In total, therefore, eDNA includes a vast functional genes, and various approaches have been developed to retrieve full-length functional genes from eDNA. The efficiency of PCR amplification of eDNA is limited, however, because in truth, the net content of actual target functional genes is rather low in eDNA. To address this technical challenge, we developed a fast and effective approach to cloning full-length functional genes from eDNA. Two important modifications were made to existing PCR-based methods: first, a real-time quantitative PCR step was added to assess the difficulty of obtaining full- length genes; second, we improved the thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR program to make it more effective for cloning the flanking regions of known fragments that are present at low abundance in eDNA. Using this approach, five novel full-length functional genes with very low identity to known genes were cloned from environmental samples. This approach has great potential for allowing discovery of functional genes from environmental sources and may be broadly applicable to molecular biology research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77955553683	Molecular detection and diversity of xylanase genes in alpine tundra soil	Xylan is a major polysaccharide in plant cell walls, and its degradation is mainly conducted by microbial xylanases in nature. To explore the xylanase diversity in the environment, two sets of degenerate primers were designed based on the microbial xylanase sequences in Pfam database of glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 10 and 11 and were used to amplify objective gene fragments directly from the alpine tundra soil DNA of the Tianshan Mountains, China. Ninety-six distinct GH 10 and 31 GH 11 xylanase gene fragments were retrieved, and most of them have low identities with known sequences in GenBank. Based on phylogenetic analysis, all of the GH 10 xylanase sequences fell into six clusters and were related to xylanases from Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria. Three clusters of GH 11 xylanase sequences were established, and two of them were related with enzymes from fungi. These results indicated the diversity of xylanase genes in this cold environment. Four xylanolytic strains were isolated from the soil, and GH 10 xylanase gene fragments were cloned using the same primers. A full-length gene was obtained and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme showed some cold-related characteristics. Our study provides an efficient molecular approach to study xylanase in complex environments and casts an insight into the diversity and distribution of xylanases in a cold environment, which is very meaningful to understand their roles in xylan degradation in nature. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77957857729	Properties of a novel α-galactosidase from Streptomyces sp. S27 and its potential for soybean processing	A full-length α-galactosidase gene (2226 bp) was cloned from Streptomyces sp. S27 ACCC 41168 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence shared highest identities of 82% with a putative α-galactosidase from Nocardiopsis dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111 and 46% with a known α-galactosidase from Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB 41171, both of which belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 36. The purified recombinant enzyme showed a single protein band of ∼82 kDa on SDS-PAGE and three bands of ∼220, 320 and 480 kDa on non-denaturing gradient PAGE, respectively, indicating its native structure of trimer, tetramer or hexamer. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at conditions of 35. °C and pH 7.4, similar to the intestinal conditions of mammals and poultry, was resistant to some neutral proteases (α-chymotrypsin, subtilisin A and collagenase), and showed hydrolytic ability to natural substrates, including melibiose, stachyose, raffinose and soybean meal. When combined with intestinal proteases, the enzyme showed higher hydrolytic ability to raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) in soybean product. These favorable properties make the Streptomyces sp. S27 α-galactosidase very prospective in soybean processing for food and feed industries. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A4 with potential applications in the brewing industry	A xylanase gene, xynA4-2, was obtained from the genome sequence of thermoacidophilic Alicyclobacillus sp. A4 and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). xynA4-2 encodes a mature protein of 411 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 46.8 kDa. Based on the amino acid sequence similarities (highest identity of 61%), the enzyme was confined into glycoside hydrolase family 10. The purified recombinant XynA4-2 exhibited maximum activity at pH 6.2 and 55°C. The enzyme was stable over a broad pH range, retaining more than 90% of the original activity at pH 5.8-12.0, 37°C for 1 h. The substrate specificity of XynA4-2 was relatively narrow, exhibiting 100, 93, and 35% of the relative activity towards birchwood xylan, oat spelt xylan, and wheat arabinoxylan, respectively. Supplementation of XynA4-2 to mash caused the reduction of mash filtration rate (5.6%) and viscosity (4.0%). When combined with the commercial glucanase from Sunson, higher reduction was detected in the filtration rate (12.0%) and viscosity (17.2%).

The 1446-bp full-length gene encodes a 481-residue polypeptide (XynGR40) containing a catalytic domain belonging to glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 10. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that XynGR40 was closely related with microbial xylanases of gastrointestinal source. Purified recombinant XynGR40 exhibited high activity at low temperatures, and remained active (∼10% of the activity) even at 0. °C. The optimal temperature of XynGR40 was 30. °C, much lower than other xylanases from rumen. Compared with mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts, XynGR40 had fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and lengthened loops in the catalytic domain. The enzyme also had relatively better stability at mesophilic temperatures and a higher catalytic efficiency than other known GH 10 cold active xylanases. These properties suggest that XynGR40 is a novel cold active xylanase and has great potential for basic research and industrial applications. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79751476499	High genetic diversity and different distributions of glycosyl hydrolase family 10 and 11 xylanases in the goat rumen	Background: The rumen harbors a complex microbial ecosystem for efficient hydrolysis of plant polysaccharides which are the main constituent of the diet. Xylanase is crucial for hemicellulose hydrolysis and plays an important role in the plant cell wall degradation. Xylanases of ruminal strains were widely studied, but few studies have focused on their diversity in rumen microenvironment. Methodology/Principal Findings: We explored the genetic diversity of xylanases belonging to two major glycosyl hydrolase families (GH 10 and 11) in goat rumen contents by analyzing the amplicons generated with two degenerate primer sets. Fifty-two distinct GH 10 and 35 GH 11 xylanase gene fragments (similarity <95%) were retrieved, and most had low identities with known sequences. Based on phylogenetic analysis, all GH 10 xylanase sequences fell into seven clusters, and 88.5% of them were related to xylanases from Bacteroidetes. Five clusters of GH 11 xylanase sequences were identified. Of these, 85.7% were related to xylanases from Firmicutes, and 14.3% were related to those of rumen fungi. Two full-length xylanase genes (one for each family) were directly cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Both the recombinant enzymes showed substantial xylanase activity, and were purified and characterized. Combined with the results of sheep rumen, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the two major phyla of xylan-degrading microorganisms in rumen, which is distinct from the representatives of other environments such as soil and termite hindgut, suggesting that xylan-degrading microorganisms are environment specific. Conclusion/Significance: The numerous new xylanase genes suggested the functional diversity of xylanase in the rumen microenvironment which may have great potential applications in industry and agriculture. The phylogenetic diversity and different distributions of xylanase genes will help us understand their roles in plant cell wall degradation in the rumen microenvironment. © 2011 Wang et al.

79952092709	Diversity, abundance and characterization of ruminal cysteine phytases suggest their important role in phytate degradation	A novel class of cysteine phytase showing ability to degrade phytate has recently been isolated from rumen bacteria. To expand our knowledge of this enzyme class, a total of 101 distinct cysteine phytase gene fragments were identified from the ruminal genomic DNA of Bore goats and Holstein cows, and most of them shared low identities (<50%) with known sequences. By phylogenetic analysis, these sequences were separated into three clusters that showed substantial diversity. The two most abundant cysteine phytase genes of goat rumens were cloned and their protein products were characterized. Four findings were revealed based on our results. (i) Compared with soil and water environment, where β-propeller phytase is the most important phytate-degrading enzyme, cysteine phytase is the major phytate-degrading enzyme in the anaerobic ruminal environment. (ii) Cysteine phytase fragments in the rumen contents of goat and cow have the same diversity profile, although most of the sequences and their abundance differ in the two species. (iii) Each species has their respective high-abundance genes, which may play major roles for phytate degradation. (iv) Compared with previously reported cysteine phytases that have pH optimum at 4.5, the pH optima of the two most abundant secreted goat cysteine phytases are 6.5 and 6.0, which are within the pH range found in the rumens. This study provides valuable information about the diversity, abundance and enzymatic properties of the ruminal cysteine phytases and emphasizes the important role(s) of these cysteine phytases probably in the terrestrial cycle of phosphorus. © 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 103 unique fragments of polygalacturonase (PF00295) and pectate lyase (PF00544 and PF09492) genes were retrieved from microbial DNA in the rumen of a Small Tail Han sheep, and 66% of the sequences of these fragments had low identities (<65%) with known sequences.

84864609239	A novel thermoacidophilic and thermostable endo-β-1,4-glucanase from Phialophora sp. G5: Its thermostability influenced by a distinct β-sheet and the carbohydrate-binding module	An endo-β-1,4-glucanase gene, egG5, was cloned from the fungus Phialophora sp. G5. The 1,290-bp open reading frame encodes a bimodular cellulase composed of an N-Terminal family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and a C-Terminal family 5 glycoside hydrolase catalytic module. Recombinant EgG5 produced in Pichia pastoris exhibited maximal activity at pH 4.0-5.0 and 70 °C, retained 40%of the maximal activity at pH 2.0, and was stable at pH 2.0-10.0. When compared with its closest homolog in Trichoderma sp. C-4 (70.6%identity), EgG5 had better thermostability (51.6% activity at 65 °C for 12 h vs 10% activity at 60 °C for 20 min). Sequence-structure analysis indicated that the distinct β-sheet in EgG5 in place of a linking loop in Trichoderma sp. C-4 endoglucanase might be the reason. To verify its function, two mutants, EgG5-Mut (disrupting the β-sheet with four amino acid substitutions) and EgG5-CBM (removing the CBM), were constructed, expressed in P. pastoris, and characterized. Both mutants had similar pH optima (pH 4.0) and temperature optima (70 °C) but varied in pH stabilities (pH 2.0-10.0 and pH 2.0-7.0, respectively) and thermostabilities. The thermostability of EgG5-Mut (13.4% activity vs 52.5% of EgG5 at 65 °C for 12 h) confirmed the effect of β-sheet on enzyme thermostability. EgG5-CBM was more thermostable (94.9% activity at 65 °C for 12 h and 15.5% activity at 80 °C for 30 min) and had higher specific activity (711.6 vs 60.3 Umg-1 of EgG5).

84865069028	Phylogenetic diversity and environment-specific distributions of glycosyl hydrolase family 10 xylanases in geographically distant soils	Background: Xylan is one of the most abundant biopolymers on Earth. Its degradation is mediated primarily by microbial xylanase in nature. To explore the diversity and distribution patterns of xylanase genes in soils, samples of five soil types with different physicochemical characters were analyzed. Methodology/Principal Findings: Partial xylanase genes of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 were recovered following direct DNA extraction from soil, PCR amplification and cloning. Combined with our previous study, a total of 1084 gene fragments were obtained, representing 366 OTUs. More than half of the OTUs were novel (identities of <65% with known xylanases) and had no close relatives based on phylogenetic analyses. Xylanase genes from all the soil environments were mainly distributed in Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Dictyoglomi and some fungi. Although identical sequences were found in several sites, habitat-specific patterns appeared to be important, and geochemical factors such as pH and oxygen content significantly influenced the compositions of xylan-degrading microbial communities. Conclusion/Significance: These results provide insight into the GH 10 xylanases in various soil environments and reveal that xylan-degrading microbial communities are environment specific with diverse and abundant populations. © 2012 Wang et al.

MEY-1 in Maize Seeds and Enzyme Characterization	Background: Mannans and heteromannans are widespread in plants cell walls and are well-known as anti-nutritional factors in animal feed. To remove these factors, it is common practice to incorporate endo-β-mannanase into feed for efficient nutrition absorption. The objective of this study was to overexpress a β-mannanase gene directly in maize, the main ingredient of animal feed, to simplify the process of feed production. Methodology/Principal Findings: The man5A gene encoding an excellent β-mannanase from acidophilic Bispora sp. MEY-1 was selected for heterologous overexpression. Expression of the modified gene (man5As) was driven by the embryo-specific promoter ZM-leg1A, and the transgene was transferred to three generations by backcrossing with commercial inbred Zheng58. Its exogenous integration into the maize embryonic genome and tissue specific expression in seeds were confirmed by PCR and Southern blot and Western blot analysis, respectively. Transgenic plants at BC3 generation showed agronomic traits statistically similar to Zheng58 except for less plant height (154.0 cm vs 158.3 cm). The expression level of MAN5AS reached up to 26,860 units per kilogram of maize seeds. Compared with its counterpart produced in Pichia pastoris, seed-derived MAN5AS had higher temperature optimum (90°C), and remained more β-mannanase activities after pelleting at 80°C, 100°C or 120°C. Conclusion/Significance: This study shows the genetically stable overexpression of a fungal β-mannanase in maize and offers an effective and economic approach for transgene containment in maize for direct utilization without any purification or supplementation procedures. © 2013 Xu et al.

84874208568	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a new alkaline active multidomain xylanase from alkaline wastewater sludge	A xylanase gene, xyn-b39, coding for a multidomain glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 protein was cloned from the genomic DNA of the alkaline wastewater sludge of a paper mill. Its deduced amino acid sequence of 1,481 residues included two carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) of family CBM_4_9, one catalytic domain of GH 10, one family 9 CBM and three S-layer homology (SLH) domains. xyn-b39 was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Xyn-b39 exhibited maximum activity at pH 7. 0 and 60 °C, and remained highly active under alkaline conditions (more than 80 % activity at pH 9. 0 and 40 % activity at pH 10. 0). The enzyme was thermostable at 55 °C, retaining more than 90 % of the initial activity after 2 h pre-incubation. Xyn-b39 had wide substrate specificity and hydrolyzed soluble substrates (birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan, oat spelt xylan, wheat arabinoxylan) and insoluble substrates (oat spelt xylan and wheat arabinoxylan). Hydrolysis product analysis indicated that Xyn-b39 was an endo-type xylanase. The K

84874806579	Distinct actions by Paenibacillus sp. strain E18 α-larabinofuranosidases and xylanase in xylan degradation	We cloned a Paenibacillus sp. strain E18 5.3-kb xylanolytic gene cluster that contains three open reading frames encoding two family 43 α-L-arabinofuranosidases (Abf43A and Abf43B) and one family 10 xylanase (XynBE18). The deduced amino acid sequences of Abf43A and Abf43B were at most 68% and 63% identical to those of two putative family 43 proteins from Clostridium sp. strain DL-VIII (EHI98634.1 and EHI98635.1), respectively, but were only 11% identical to each other. Recombinant Abf43A and Abf43B had similar activities at 45°C and pH 6.0 but varied in thermostabilities and substrate specificities. Abf43B was active against only 4-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside, whereas Abf43A acted on 4-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside, wheat arabinoxylan, 4-nitrophenyl α-D-xylopyranoside, and sugar beet arabinan. The sequential and combined effects on xylan degradation by XynBE18, Abf43A, and Abf43B were characterized. For beechwood, birchwood, and oat spelt xylans as the substrates, synergistic effects were found when XynBE18 and Abf43A or Abf43B were incubated together and when the substrates were first incubated with Abf43A or Abf43B and then with XynBE18. Further high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the amounts of xylobiose and xylose increased sharply in the aforementioned reactions. For water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan as the substrate, Abf43A not only released arabinose but also had a synergistic effect with XynBE18. Synergy may arise as the result of removal of arabinose residues from xylans by α-L-arabinofuranosidases, which eliminates steric hindrance caused by the arabinose side chains and which allows xylanases to then degrade the xylan backbone, producing short xylooligosaccharides. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

84879485236	High-yield production of a low-temperature-active polygalacturonase for papaya juice clarification	A novel endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG I) from Achaetomium sp. Xz8 was identified, overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and characterized in this report. Recombinant endo-PG I is distinguished from other enzyme counterparts by its high activity towards polygalacturonic acid (49,934 U/ml) and high yield in the 15-l fermentor (2.13 g/l). It exhibits optimal activity at 45 °C and remained active over a broad temperature range of 0-80 °C. Distinct from most fungal polygalacturonases that have acidic pH optima, endo-PG I is optimally active at pH 6, similar to the pH of fresh papaya juice (5.7). Endo-PG I alone reduced the viscosity of papaya juice by 17.6%, and increased its transmittance by 59.1%. When combined with a commercial pectin methylesterase, it showed much higher efficiency with a synergy degree of more than 1.25. All these favourable enzymatic properties make endo-PG I attractive for potential applications in the juice industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880046285	Identification, expression and bioactivity of Paramisgurnus dabryanus β-defensin that might be involved in immune defense against bacterial infection	β-defensins are a large family of multi-disulfide-bonded peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities that contribute to innate host defense in many organisms, but little information is available about β-defensins produced by freshwater fish lacking scales. We therefore cloned and identified a β-defensin gene from Chinese loach (Paramisgurnus dabryanus) by designing degenerate primers and using thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR. This gene is the first defensin gene ever identified in a non-scaled freshwater fish. Annotation of the protein domain architecture showed that the putative Chinese loach β-defensin contains the signature motif of six conserved cysteines within the mature peptide, an aspect similar to β-defensins of other marine fish. We also used quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the expression pattern of the Chinese loach β-defensin gene, mRNA of which could be observed in various tissues. After challenge with the pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila, β-defensin expression was induced in the eye, gill, skin, and spleen of the adult loach. The bioactivity of the recombinant P. dabryanus β-defensin was examined against pathogenic bacteria, and the results suggest that this class 2 β-defensin has potential applications for treatment of bacterial infections. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Xz-8 with high catalytic efficiency and application potentials in the brewing industry	This study identified two family-11 xylanase genes (xynC81 and xynC83) in Achaetomium sp. Xz-8, a thermophilic strain from a desert area with substantial xylanase activity, and successfully expressed them in Pichia pastoris. Their deduced amino acid sequences showed the highest identity of ≤90% to known fungal xylanases and of ≤62% with each other. The purified recombinant xylanases showed optimal activities at pH 5.5 and 60-65 C and exhibited stability over pH 5.0-10.0 and temperatures at 55 C and below. XynC81 had high catalytic efficiency (6082 mL/s/mg), and XynC83 was favorable for xylooligosaccharide production. Under simulated mashing conditions, combination of XynC83 and a commercial β-glucanase improved the filtration rate by 34.76%, which is much better than that of Novozymes Ultraflo (20.71%). XynC81 and XynC83 had a synergistic effect on viscosity reduction (7.08%), which is comparable with that of Ultraflo (8.47%). Thus, XynC81 and XynC83 represent good candidates for application in the brewing industry. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

The gene (1,110 bp) encodes a 369-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 40.8 kDa. The deduced sequence of Man5XZ7 consists of a putative 17-residue signal peptide and a catalytic module belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5, and displays 76 % identity with the experimentally verified GH 5 endo-β-1,4-mannanase from Podospora anserina. Recombinant Man5XZ7 was optimally active at 75 C and pH 5.0 and exhibited high activity at a wide temperature range (>50.0 % activity at 50-85 C). Moreover, it had good adaptability to acidic to basic pH (>74.1 % activity at pH 4.0-7.0 and 25.6 % even at pH 9.0) and good stability from pH 3.0 to 10.0. These enzymatic properties showed that Man5XZ7 was a new thermophilic and alkali-tolerant β-mannanase.

84887139557	Two xylose-tolerant GH43 bifunctional β-xylosidase/α- arabinosidases and one GH11 xylanase from Humicola insolens and their synergy in the degradation of xylan	Two β-xylosidases of family 43 (Xyl43A and Xyl43B) and one xylanase of family 11 (Xyn11A) were identified from the genome sequence of Humicola insolens Y1, and their gene products were successfully expressed in heterologous hosts. The optimal activities of the purified Xyl43A, Xyl43B, and Xyn11A were found at pH 6.5-7.0 and 50-60 C. They were stable over a pH range of 5.0-10.0 and temperatures of 50 C and below. Xyl43A and Xyl43B had the activities of β-xylosidase, α-arabinosidase and xylanase, and showed xylose tolerance up to 79 and 292 mM, respectively. Xyn11A and Xyl43A or Xyl43B showed significant synergistic effects on the degradation of various xylans, releasing more reduced sugars (up to 1.29 folds) by simultaneous or sequential addition.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed deduced PdAkirin2 had high sequence identities to Akirin2 homologs from fish and mammals (70-91%), it contained two conserved nuclear localization signals (NLSs) with verified sub-cellular localization. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR analysis indicated that PdAkirin2 was present in a wide range of loach tissues and showed up-regulation with challenges of Aeromonas hydrophila NJ-1, LPS and poly I:C. PdAkirin2 as an immune factor had significant effects on the expression of cytokines (TNFα, IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-1β) and transcription factor NF-κB.

84894270704	Overexpression of an acidic endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase in transgenic maize seed for direct utilization in animal feed	Background: Incorporation of exogenous glucanase into animal feed is common practice to remove glucan, one of the anti-nutritional factors, for efficient nutrition absorption. The acidic endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase (Bgl7A) from Bispora sp. MEY-1 has excellent properties and represents a potential enzyme supplement to animal feed. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we successfully developed a transgenic maize producing a high level of Bgl7AM (codon modified Bgl7A) by constructing a recombinant vector driven by the embryo-specific promoter ZM-leg1A. Southern and Western blot analysis indicated the stable integration and specific expression of the transgene in maize seeds over four generations. The β-glucanase activity of the transgenic maize seeds reached up to 779,800 U/kg, about 236-fold higher than that of non-transgenic maize. The β-glucanase derived from the transgenic maize seeds had an optimal pH of 4.0 and was stable at pH 1.0-8.0, which is in agreement with the normal environment of digestive tract. Conclusion/Significance: Our study offers a transgenic maize line that could be directly used in animal feed without any glucanase production, purification and supplementation, consequently simplifying the feed enzyme processing procedure. © 2013 Zhang et al.

Recombinant Man5XZ3 and its two truncated derivatives, Man5ΔCBM (removing the CBM1) and Man5ΔCL (removing both the CBM1 and linker region), were produced in Pichia pastoris and showed significant variance in the secondary structure. The three enzymes had similar biochemical properties, such as optimal pH and temperature (pH 5.0 and 80°C) and excellent pH stability at pH 4.0-10.0. Removal of the CBM1 alone could improve the thermostability of Man5XZ3, but further removal of the linker region resulted in worse thermostability. Man5XZ3 retained greater enzyme activity in the presence of an organic solvent (acetone), two detergents (SDS and Triton X-100), and a chaotropic agent (urea) compared with Man5ΔCBM and Man5ΔCL. This study provides an excellent β-mannanase candidate favorable for various industries and primarily demonstrates the relationship between enzyme structure and function. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

84899836404	A c-terminal proline-rich sequence simultaneously broadens the optimal temperature and pH ranges and improves the catalytic efficiency of glycosyl hydrolase family 10 ruminal xylanases	Efficient degradation of plant polysaccharides in rumen requires xylanolytic enzymes with a high catalytic capacity. In this study, a full-length xylanase gene (xynA) was retrieved from the sheep rumen. The deduced XynA sequence contains a putative signal peptide, a catalytic motif of glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10), and an extra C-terminal proline-rich sequence without a homolog. To determine its function, both mature XynA and its C terminus-truncated mutant, XynA-Tr, were expressed in Escherichia coli. The C-terminal oligopeptide had significant effects on the function and structure of XynA. Compared with XynA-Tr, XynA exhibited improved specific activity (12-fold) and catalytic efficiency (14-fold), a higher temperature optimum (50°C versus 45°C), and broader ranges of temperature and pH optima (pH 5.0 to 7.5 and 40 to 60°C versus pH 5.5 to 6.5 and 40 to 50°C). Moreover, XynA released more xylose than XynA-Tr when using beech wood xylan and wheat arabinoxylan as the substrate. The underlying mechanisms responsible for these changes were analyzed by substrate binding assay, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and xylooligosaccharide hydrolysis. XynA had no ability to bind to any of the tested soluble and insoluble polysaccharides. However, it contained more α helices and had a greater affinity and catalytic efficiency toward xylooligosaccharides, which benefited complete substrate degradation. Similar results were obtained when the C-terminal sequence was fused to another GH10 xylanase from sheep rumen. This study reveals an engineering strategy to improve the catalytic performance of enzymes. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

The full-length cDNA consists of 969 bp and encodes a 322-residue polypeptide with the calculated molecular weight of 34.1 kDa. Deduced PE8F46 belongs to family 8 of carbohydrate esterases and shares 54% identity with a functionally characterised counterpart from Myceliophthora thermophile.

An orthogonal experiment was employed to determine the best conditions for firming pineapple dices. After incubation with 0.75% (w/v) PE8F46 and 0.4% calcium lactate (w/v) for 20 min, the firmness of pineapple dices was improved by 47.6%, 13.7% higher than that of a commercial pectinase complex.

84900577529	Thermostability improvement of a Streptomyces xylanase by introducing proline and glutamic acid residues	Protein engineering is commonly used to improve the robustness of enzymes for activity and stability at high temperatures. In this study, we identified four residues expected to affect the thermostability of Streptomyces sp. strain S9 xylanase XynAS9 through multiple- sequence analysis (MSA) and molecular dynamic simulations (MDS). Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to construct five mutants by replacing these residues with proline or glutamic acid (V81P, G82E, V81P/G82E, D185P/S186E, and V81P/G82E/ D185P/S186E), and the mutant and wild-type enzymes were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Compared to the wild-type XynAS9, all five mutant enzymes showed improved thermal properties. The activity and stability assays, including circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry, showed that the mutations at positions 81 and 82 increased the thermal performance more than the mutations at positions 185 and 186. The mutants with combined substitutions (V81P/G82E and V81P/G82E/D185P/ S186E) showed the most pronounced shifts in temperature optima, about 17°C upward, and their half-lives for thermal inactivation at 70°C and melting temperatures were increased by >9 times and approximately 7.0°C, respectively. The mutation combination of V81P and G82E in adjacent positions more than doubled the effect of single mutations. Both mutation regions were at the end of long secondary-structure elements and probably rigidified the local structure. MDS indicated that a long loop region after positions 81 and 82 located at the end of the inner β-barrel was prone to unfold. The rigidified main chain and filling of a groove by the mutations on the bottom of the active site canyon may stabilize the mutants and thus improve their thermostability. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

84905403821	Preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of thermostable β-1,4-xylanase from Streptomyces sp. S9	Xylanase, which catalyzes the random hydrolysis of internal xylosidic linkages, is a critical enzyme participating in xylan decomposition and has been widely applied in industrial utilizations. Xylanase isolated from the extremophilic Streptomyces sp. S9 (XynAS9) possesses broad adaptability to temperature and pH and thus is an attractive candidate in industrial applications. In particular, the major products of XynAS9 are xylose and xylobiose, which enable the subsequent bioconversion to be carried out with higher efficiency. Therefore, the three-dimensional structure of XynAS9 and its catalytic machinery are of great interest. Here, recombinant XynAS9 protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and crystallized. Crystals belonging to the hexagonal space group P6522, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 80.9, c = 289.3 Å, were obtained by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to 2.08 Å resolution.

Addition of 1 U/g PG7fn increased the pectin bioavailability by 19.33%. The excellent properties described above make PG7fn valuable for applications in the food and feed industries. Furthermore, a comparative study showed that N-glycosylation improved the thermostability and catalytic efficiency of PG7fn.

84921999884	Biochemical characterization of a thermophilic β-mannanase from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 with high specific activity	Thermophilic β-mannanases are of increasing importance for wide industrial applications. In the current study, gene cloning, functional expression in Pichia pastoris, and characterization of a thermophilic β-mannanase (Man5A) from thermophilic Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 are reported. Deduced Man5A exhibits the highest identity with a putative β-mannanase from Talaromyces stipitatus ATCC10500 (70.3 %) and is composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, a fungal-type carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of family 1, and a catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 5 at the C-terminus. Two recombinant proteins with different glycosylation levels, termed Man5A1 (72 kDa) and Man5A2 (60 kDa), were identified after purification. Both enzymes were thermophilic, exhibiting optimal activity at 85–90 °C, and were highly stable at 70 °C. Man5A1 and Man5A2 had a pH optimum of 4.5 and 4.0, respectively, and were highly stable over the broad pH range of 3.0–10.0. Most metal ions and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) had no effect on the enzymatic activities. Man5A1 and Man5A2 exhibited high specific activity (2,160 and 1,800 U/mg, respectively) when using locust bean gum as the substrate. The CBM1 and two key residues D191 and R286 were found to affect Man5A thermostability. Man5A displays a classical four-site-binding mode, hydrolyzing mannooligosaccharides into smaller units, galactomannan into mannose and mannobiose, and glucomanman into mannose, mannobiose, and mannopentaose, respectively. All these properties make Man5A a good candidate for extensive applications in the bioconversion, pulp bleaching, textile, food, and feed industries.

84921027169	Isolation of a Novel Cold-Active Family 11 Xylanase from the Filamentous Fungus Bispora antennata and Deletion of its N-Terminal Amino Acids on Thermostability	In the present study, we first reported a cold-active xylanase of glycosyl hydrolase family 11, Xyn11, from the filamentous fungus Bispora antennata. The coding gene (xyn11) was cloned and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Deduced Xyn11 exhibited the highest identity of 65 % with a family 11 endo-β-1,4-xylanase from Alternaria sp. HB186. Recombinant Xyn11 exhibited maximal activity at 35 °C and remained 21 % of the activity at 0 °C. Sequence alignment showed that the N-terminal sequence of Xyn11 is distinct from those of thermophilic xylanases of family 11. To determine its effect on enzyme properties, the Xyn11 mutant without the N-terminal sequence, t-Xyn11, was then constructed, expressed in P. pastoris, and compared with Xyn11. Both enzymes showed optimal activities at 35 °C and pH 5.5 and were stable at pH 2.0–12.0. Compared with truncated mutant t-Xyn11, Xyn11 retained more activity after 20-min incubation at 40 °C (Xyn11:28 % vs. t-Xyn11:4 %) and degraded xylan substrates more completely. Thus, a new factor affecting the thermostability of cold-active xylanase of family 11 was identified.

84922464522	A New GH43 α-Arabinofuranosidase from Humicola insolens Y1: Biochemical Characterization and Synergistic Action with a Xylanase on Xylan Degradation	A new α-arabinofuranosidase gene (Hiabf43) was cloned from Humicola insolens Y1 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Deduced HiAbf43 contained a putative signal peptide and a catalytic domain of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 43. Purified recombinant HiAbf43 showed optimal activity at pH 5.0 and 50 °C, and was active over a broad pH range. The enzyme was specific for the cleavage of α-1,3-linkage and showed high activity against 4-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside, debranched arabinan, and sugar beet arabinan. Sequential addition of HiAbf43 followed by Xyn11A increased the degradation efficiency of birchwood and beechwood xylans but not wheat arabinoxylan. The synergy degree was high up to 1.21-fold.
