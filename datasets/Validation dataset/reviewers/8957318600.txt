21644468214	Microbial transformation of methyl protodioscin by Cunninghamella elegans	Biotransformation of methyl protodioscin (1) by Cunninghamella elegans (AS 3.1207) was investigated. Nine bioconversion products were isolated and identified. Eight of the bioconversion products were pregnane glycoside or steroidal saponins. It was found that steroidal saponin skeleton could be converted to pregnenolone skeleton only using microbial methods, which must have chemical procedures in the reported literatures. The found enriched the types of bioconversion reaction and provided a new way for the production of androstenedione. Most bioconversion products showed considerable cytotoxic activities against HepG2, NCI-H460, MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines compared to methyl protodioscin. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0030650233	Coal beneficiation - sulfur removal using methanol	The removal of sulfur from coal by methanol has been investigated in a 300 ml batch reactor. The Illinois IBC-108 coal used is highly beneficiated and contains mainly organic sulfur; the results are, therefore, also applicable to organic sulfur removal. Temperature, reaction time and the amount of methanol increased sulfur removal, while the amount of coal used decreased it. Coal pyrolysis was explored in both open and closed systems. The best results, a total sulfur removal of 86% (90% for organic) were obtained at 500 °C, 60-90 min. reaction time and very small amounts of coal, with a weight loss of about 30%. An empirical correlation for total sulfur removal is presented.

28944439819	Experimental study of cartilage reconstruction using directed inducing MSCs-alginate complex	Objective: To evaluate the practicability of cartilage reconstruction using directed inducing bone marrow stem cells (MSCs)- alginate complex. Methods: The MSCs were seperated by gradient centrifugation on Percoll, then were induced into chon-drogenic differentiation. After 14 days, immunohistochemical techique was applied to detect the expression of collagen type I. Then, the MSCs and calcium alginate were mixed to form a complex and were planted under the skin of nude mice. Histochemical or immuno-histochemical tests were made at 4 weeks and 8 weeks later. Results: The MSCs showed the positive result of collagen type I. There were chondrcytes and cartilage lacuna at 4 weeks later, and chondrocytes and the collagen secreted by them became more at 8 weeks later. But, the MSCs without directed inducing did not show the character of the chondrocyte. Conclusion: The way of using directed inducing MSCs-alginate complex can form cartilage; it is possible to repair the defect of cartilage in clinical practice.

33745976498	Microbial metabolism of methyl protodioscin by Aspergillus niger culture-A new androstenedione producing way from steroid	Methyl protodioscin (1), a natural furostanol biglycoside steroid, was a preclinical anticancer drug, which showed potent activity against most cell lines from leukemia and solid tumors in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) human cancer panel. Metabolism of methyl protodioscin by Aspergillus niger was investigated. Seven metabolites were isolated and identified. Two main metabolites were pregnane glycosides and four were furostanol glycosides, together with the aglycone. It was found that steroidal saponin skeleton could be converted to pregnenolone skeleton only using microbial methods, which must have chemical procedures in the reported literatures. The proposed biosynthetic pathways of the microbial conversion products of methyl protodioscin were drawn. The found enriched the reaction types of microbial bioconversion and provided a new producing way of androstenedione from steroid.

33745924415	SUMO-1 modification increases human SOD1 stability and aggregation	The mutations in the gene encoding copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause approximately 20% cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), characterized by selective loss of motor neurons. Mutant SOD1 forms inclusions in tissues from FALS patients. However, the precise mechanism of the accumulation of mutant SOD1 remains unclear. Here we show that human SOD1 is a substrate modified by SUMO-1. A conversion of lysine 75 to an arginine within a SUMO consensus sequence in SOD1 completely abolishes SOD1 sumoylation. We further show that SUMO-1 modification, on both wild-type and mutant SOD1, increases SOD1 steady state level and aggregation. Moreover, SUMO-1 co-localizes onto the aggregates formed by SOD1. These findings imply that SUMO-1 modification on lysine 75 may participate in regulating SOD1 stability and its aggregation process. Thus, our results suggest that sumoylation of SOD1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of FALS associated with mutant SOD1. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33845534798	Improving asymmetric reduction of aryl ketone catalyzed by yeast cell with resin adsorption	Optically active aryl alcohols are one kind of the most important chiral building blocks for many single enantiomer pharmaceuticals. Asymmetric reduction of corresponding prochiral ketone to chiral alcohol by active yeast cells is one of the most promising routes, but the space-time productivity is very low due to the toxicity of the substrate and product to the cell, which prohibits the reaction from proceeding at a high substrate concentration. The toxicity of aryl ketone to yeast cell and increasing the initial substrate concentration by introducing macropore adsorbing resin to avoid the toxicity to the cell was studied, when asymmetric reduction of acetophenone (ACP) to chiral α-phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen as the model reaction. The experiments showed that the substrate and product did have obvious toxicity to yeast cell. This reaction could be remarkably improved with introducing the appropriate kind of resin. The initial ACP concentration could be increased to 70 mmol·L

33751109725	The effects of different cold preservation times of transplanted small intestine on histological change and survival of recipients in rats	Objective: To investigate the effects of different cold preservation times of transplanted small intestine on histological change and recipient survival in rats. Methods: SD rats were randomly divided into groups L, L3, L6, L12 and L18, with 6 in each. L: sham-operation group; L3: cold preservation time of 3 hours; L6: cold preservation time of 6 hours; L12: cold preservation time of 12 hours; L18: cold preservation time of 18 hours. Orthotopic small bowel transplantation model was established. The warm ischemia time was 2-3 minutes in all groups. Except the sham-operation group, all the rest groups were processed for the corresponding cold preservation time (4 °C), respectively. The samples were obtained from the different groups for histological examination after reperfusion for 1 hour. The survival time was recorded. Results: By HE staining, each group was histologically injuried in different degree. For in stance, villi were shortened and had abscission; mucous membranes became thin, myometrium had edema and thickened; the epithelial basement membrane was disrupted. Under transmission electron microscope, microvilli lined up out of order. With cold preservation time increasing, the microvilli had abscission, muscle cells and mitochondria had edema, blood vessel endothelium CAP window was enlarged, the epithelial basement membrane was disrupted. In the L12 group, the apoptotic body appeared, while in the L18 group, the quantity of apoptotic body increased obviously. The survival analysis showed that as the time of cold preservation increased, the survival rate of rats after intestinal transplantation decreased (P<0.05). Conclusion: Small intestine preserved for a period of 6 hours in Ringer lactate solution is suitable for transplantation while preservation time more than 18 hours is unsuitable.

33846123660	Recent development advances in improving asymmetric reduction of prechiral ketone with active cell	The synthesis of chiral compounds has become a hot field in organic synthesis. Biotransformation with active cell is probably one of the most promising techniques in asymmetric synthesis. Although many reactions and microorganisms with outstanding stereoselectivity were reported, just very few were applied actually, the low space-time productivity was the determinant reason. Herein the causes of low space-time productivity of these reactions were analyzed in detail. Also, the advances in asymmetric reduction of prechiral ketone with active cell were reviewed in this paper. And recent developments in methods to improve the space-time productivity were discussed in detail in classified as continuous reaction, reaction with additive, reaction in nonaqueous phase and reaction accompanied with separation.

34247160537	Phosphorylation of ataxin-3 by glycogen synthase kinase 3β at serine 256 regulates the aggregation of ataxin-3	Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract in MJD-1 gene product, ataxin-3. Recently, studies show that phosphorylation of polyglutamine disease proteins, such as huntingtin, ataxin-1 and DRPLA, plays an important role in regulating pathogenesis. However, the kinase that phosphorylates ataxin-3 remains unknown. Here we show that S256 site in ataxin-3 is phosphorylated by GSK 3β. Moreover, S256A mutant of expanded ataxin-3 forms high molecular weight protein aggregation, whereas S256D mutant and expanded ataxin-3 without mutation on this site are monomeric. The molecular chaperone Hsp70 represses the aggregation of S256A mutant. Our results imply that phosphorylation of serine 256 in ataxin-3 by GSK 3β regulates ataxin-3 aggregation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Altogether 104 tissue specimens of posterior rectus sheath were obtained during abdominal operation in patients including 16 inguinal hernia patients. The contents of collagen type I/III were detected using immunohistochemical methods and computer imaging analysis. The data were presented as gray level. The study was to analyze the content of collagen and to observe for differences between inguinal hernia group and control group. Results: When compared to control group, inguinal hernia group had less collagen I, more collagen III, more total amount of collagen, and lower ratio of collagen I/III. Conclusion: The decreased ratio of collagen type I/III was observed in inguinal hernia patients, with lower collagen type I collagen and relatively higher collagen type III when compared with control group. Therefore, inguinal hernia can be regarded as a local manifestation of a systematic collagen disorder.

34547864590	Nurr1 is phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro and its phosphorylation upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase expression in SH-SY5Y cells	Nurr1 is an orphan nuclear receptor essential for development and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Mutations in Nurr1 are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and there is a correlation between Nurr1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in PD brain. Two domains, activation function 1 (AF1) at the N-terminus and AF2 at the C-terminus of Nurr1, are important for Nurr1 activation. AF1 domain is conserved in NGFI-B/Nurr1/Nor-1 family members and MAPK signal pathway is involved in AF1 activity. Using in vitro phoshorylation assays, we have shown that ERK2 is a kinase to phosphorylate Nurr1 on multiple sites. S126 and T132, which are located near AF1 core of Nurr1, are dominant sites phosphorylated by ERK2. Moreover, using GST pull-down and co-IP assays, we identified that both the N-terminus of Nurr1 containing three ERK docking domains and another ERK docking domain in Nurr1 DNA binding domain are able to bind to ERK2. Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active form of MEK1, together with Nurr1 and mouse ERK2, greatly increases the tyrosine hydroxylase expression in SH-SY5Y cells. Reporter gene assays show that Nurr1Δ124-133/T185A, an ERK2 phospho-site mutant form, could not further increase its transcriptional activity on TH promoter, suggesting that Nurr1 phosphorylation by ERK2 may regulate its transcriptional activity on TH promoter. Thus, our results indicate that Nurr1 phosphorylation by ERK2 may play a role in regulating the TH expression. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

40849138195	DJ-1 decreases Bax expression through repressing p53 transcriptional activity	DJ-1, originally identified as an oncogene product, is a protein with various functions in cellular transformation, oxidative stress response, and transcriptional regulation. Although previous studies suggest that DJ-1 is cytoprotective, the mechanism by which DJ-1 exerts its survival functions remains largely unknown. Here we show that DJ-1 exerts its cytoprotection through inhibiting p53-Bax-caspase pathway. DJ-1 interacts with p53 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of DJ-1 decreases the expression of Bax and inhibits caspase activation, whereas knockdown of DJ-1 increases Bax protein levels and accelerates caspase-3 activation and cell death induced by UV exposure. Our data provide evidence that the protective effects of DJ-1 on apoptosis are associated with its ability of decreasing Bax level through inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

34249807884	p45, an ATPase subunit of the 19S proteasome, targets the polyglutamine disease protein ataxin-3 to the proteasome	Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract near the C-terminus of the MJD-1 gene product, ataxin-3. Ataxin-3 is degraded by the proteasome. However, the precise mechanism of ataxin-3 degradation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we show direct links between ataxin-3 and the proteasome. p45, an ATPase subunit of the 19S proteasome, interacts with ataxin-3 in vitro and stimulates the degradation of ataxin-3 in an in vitro reconstituted degradation assay system. The effect of p45 on ataxin-3 degradation is blocked by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. In N2a or 293 cells, overexpression of p45 strikingly enhances the clearance of both normal and expanded ataxin-3, but not alpha synuclein or SOD1, implying a functional specificity of p45 in this proteolytic process. The N-terminus of ataxin-3, which serves as a recognition site by p45, is necessary for the proteolytic process of ataxin-3. We also show that other three ATPases of the 19S proteasome, MSS1, p48, and p56 have no effect on ataxin-3 degradation. These data provide evidence that p45 plays an important role in regulating ataxin-3 degradation by the proteasome. © 2007 The Authors.

34247631739	Methyl protodioscin induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 liver cancer cells	Methyl protodioscin (NSC-698790) is one of the main bioactive components in the traditional Chinese medicine Dioscorea collettii var. hypoglauca (Dioscoreaceae). In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative effect of methyl protodioscin on the HepG2 cells and the mechanism of the induced cytotoxicity. Treatment of methyl protodioscin resulted in G2/M arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. These effects were attributed to down-regulation of Cyclin B1 and the signaling pathways leading to up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of BCL2, suggesting that methyl protodioscin may be a novel anti-mitotic agent. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The chemical structure of new metabolite was characterized by analysis of IR, NMR, and HRESI- MS spectroscopic data. Among the isolated compounds, 13, 16, and 18 (each at 20 μM) could significantly promote the gene transcriptional function of nuclear receptor RXRα. While 7-9, 13, 14, and the new structure 1 (each at 20 ìM) showed significant reduction in RXRá gene transcriptional activities induced by 9-cis-retinoid acid. The findings indicated that these furocoumarin skeleton derivatives might hold beneficial effects on many intractable diseases, such as cancer and metabolic diseases, due to their potential activities on regulating the transcriptional activation function of RXRα.

84887989591	The BAG2 protein stabilises PINK1 by decreasing its ubiquitination	Mutations in the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson disease (PD). Thus far, little is known about what can regulate the ubiquitin proteasome pathway of PINK1. Here, we report BAG2 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene family protein 2), a member of the BAG family, which directly binds with and stabilises PINK1 by decreasing its ubiquitination. Moreover, we found that BAG2 also binds with the pathogenic R492X PINK1 mutation directly and more tightly. Moreover, BAG2 stabilises the R492X PINK1 mutation by decreasing its ubiquitination to a greater extent than the wild-type species. Our data correlate BAG2 to PINK1 for the first time, strengthening the important role of BAG2 in PD-related neurodegeneration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84897524945	Gambogenic acid kills lung cancer cells through aberrant autophagy	Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and causes 1.38 million deaths annually, as of 2008 worldwide. Identifying natural anti-lung cancer agents has become very important. Gambogenic acid (GNA) is one of the active compounds of Gamboge, a traditional medicine that was used as a drastic purgative, emetic, or vermifuge for treating tapeworm. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that GNA exerts promising anti-tumor effects; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present paper, we found that GNA could induce the formation of vacuoles, which was linked with autophagy in A549 and HeLa cells. Further studies revealed that GNA triggers the initiation of autophagy based on the results of MDC staining, AO staining, accumulation of LC3 II, activation of Beclin 1 and phosphorylation of P70S6K. However, degradation of p62 was disrupted and free GFP could not be released in GNA treated cells, which indicated a block in the autophagy flux. Further studies demonstrated that GNA blocks the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes by inhibiting acidification in lysosomes. This dysfunctional autophagy plays a pro-death role in GNA-treated cells by activating p53, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 while decreasing Bcl-2. Beclin 1 knockdown greatly decreased GNA-induced cell death and the effects on p53, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2. Similar results were obtained using a xenograft model. Our findings show, for the first time, that GNA can cause aberrant autophagy to induce cell death and may suggest the potential application of GNA as a tool or viable drug in anticancer therapies. © 2014 Mei et al.

48749096173	PolyQ-expanded ataxin-3 interacts with full-length ataxin-3 in a polyQ length-dependent manner	Objective: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in MJD-1 gene product, ataxin-3 (AT3). This disease is characterized by the formation of intraneuronal inclusions, but the mechanism underlying their formation is still poorly understood. The present study is to explore the relationship between wild type (WT) AT3 and polyQ expanded AT3. Methods: Mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells or HEK293 cells were co-transfected with WT AT3 and different truncated forms of expanded AT3. The expressions of WT AT3 and the truncated forms of expanded AT3 were detected by Western blotting, and observed by an inverted fluorescent microscope. The interactions between AT3 and different truncated forms of expanded AT3 were detected by immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Results: Using fluorescent microscope, we observed that the truncated forms of expanded AT3 aggregate in transfected cells, and the full-length WT AT3 is recruited onto the aggregates. However, no aggregates were observed in cells transfected with the truncated forms of WT AT3. Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses indicate that WT AT3 interacts with the truncated AT3 in a polyQ length-dependent manner. Conclusion: WT AT3 deposits in the aggregation that was formed by polyQ expanded AT3, which suggests that the formation of AT3 aggregation may affect the normal function of WT AT3 and increase polyQ protein toxicity in MJD. © 2008 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

51349148484	Toxicity of aromatic ketone to yeast cell and improvement of the asymmetric reduction of aromatic ketone catalyzed by yeast cell with the introduction of resin adsorption	Asymmetric reduction of the prochiral aromatic ketone catalyzed by yeast cells is one of the most promising routes to produce its corresponding enantiopure aromatic alcohol, but the space-time yield does not meet people's expectations. Therefore, the toxicity of aromatic ketone and aromatic alcohol to the yeast cell is investigated in this work. It has been found that the aromatic compounds are poisonous to the yeast cell. The activity of yeast cell decreases steeply when the concentration of acetophenone (ACP) is higher than 30.0 mmol/L. Asymmetric reduction of acetophenone to chiral S-α- phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) catalyzed by the yeast cell was chosen as the model reaction to study in detail the promotion effect of the introduction of the resin adsorption on the asymmetric reduction reaction. The resin acts as the substrate reservoir and product extraction agent in situ. It has been shown that this reaction could be remarkably improved with this technique when the appropriate kind of resin is applied. The enantioselectivity and yield are acceptable even though the initial ACP concentration reaches 72.2 mmol/L.

53949117951	Casein kinase 2 interacts with and phosphorylates ataxin-3	Objective: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tract near the C-terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The precise mechanism of the MJD/SCA3 pathogenesis remains unclear. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that phosphorylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, few kinases are known to phosphorylate ataxin-3. The present study is to explore whether ataxin-3 is a substrate of casein kinase 2 (CK2). Methods: The interaction between ataxin-3 and CK2 was identified by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipition assay. The phosphorylation of ataxin-3 by CK2 was measured by in vitro phosphorylation assays. Results: (1) Both wild type and expanded ataxin-3 interacted with CK2α and CK2β in vitro. (2) In 293 cells, both wild type and expanded ataxin-3 interacted with CK2β, but not CK2α. (3) CK2 phosphorylated wild type and expanded ataxin-3. Conclusion: Ataxin-3 is a substrate of protein kinase CK2. © 2008 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

Methods: Immunohistochemical SP method was adopted in detecting the VEGF-C protein expression in 60 cases of breast cancer, and the lymphatic vessels were labeled with D2-40. We took 15 cases of breast fibroadenoma as controls. Results: The rate of VEGF-C positive expression in breast cancer was higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). VEGF-C expression was positively correlated with lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and axillary lymph node (both P<0.05). VEGF-C was significantly higher in lymph node-positive group than in lymph node-negative group. Different levels of lymphangiogenesis occurred in all the cases of breast cancer; LVD was significantly higher in VEGF-C positive group than that in the negative group, but it was mainly located in tumor stroma, and apparently mature lymphatic vessels were not found in cancer nests. LVD was positively related to the lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. It was obviously higher in lymph node-positive group than in lymph node-negative group (P<0. 05). Conclusion: Lymphangiogenesis occurred in the tumor stroma tissue predominantly. The expression of VEGF-C was positively correlated with lymphangiogenesis and axillary lymph node metastasis in primary breast cancer.

The atmosphere, temperature and sulfur concentration in coal were considered in the experiment. The experimental results indicated that the behavior of As had relations to the weight loss rate of coal, the peak of As vaporization rate occurred at the maximum coal volatilization rate. However, the variation of Se concentration in ash was very limited when temperature was above 600°C. Moreover, it was also observed that the vaporization of Se and As in the low sulfur coal was easier than that of the high sulfur coal.

67649212683	The behaviour of phosphorus and heavy metals in sewage sludge ashes	The effect of the combustion atmosphere and the additives (CaO and HCl) on the behaviour of phosphorus and heavy metals during sewage sludge combustion was investigated. The results demonstrated that the reduction combustion promoted the vapourisation of phosphorus and heavy metals during sewage sludge combustion. Moreover, the concentrations of phosphorus and heavy metals in the bottom ash decreased with increasing HCl ratio, and the addition of CaO can stabilise heavy metals and phosphorus. It was also observed that phosphorus and heavy metals increased with increasing CaO ratio. Lastly, the difference of the TG-DTA curves with and without additives is discussed.

67651163827	Correlation of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 expressions with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer	Objective: To study the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) in breast cancer and their correlations with lymph node metastasis. Methods: Immunohistochemical SP method was adopted in detecting VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 protein expressions in 60 cases of breast cancer and 15 cases of breast fibroadenoma as controls. Results: The positive rate and degree of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 expressions in breast cancer were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were conspicuously higher in lymph-node-positive group than in lymphnode-negative group (P<0.05). The expressions of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were positively correlated with axillary lymph node metastasis; VEGF-C expression was positively associated with VEGFR-3. However, there were no significant differences in pathologic features, tumor size and clinical stage. Conclusion: The expressions of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were higher in breast cancer, and they promoted lymph node metastasis.

69449092501	NGFI-B nuclear orphan receptor Nurr1 interacts with p53 and suppresses its transcriptional activity	Nurr1 is a member of the NGFI-B nuclear orphan receptor family which includes two other members, Nur77 and Nor-1. Nurr1 is essential for the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons. It was reported that Nurr1 has antiapoptotic functions, however, the mechanisms by which Nurr1 mediates these effects remain unknown. Here, we show that overexpression of Nurr1 decreases Bax expression whereas knockdown of Nurr1 increases Bax expression. Nurr1 also interacts with p53 and represses its assembly. Furthermore, Nurr1 represses p53 transcriptional activity in interaction-dependent and dose-dependent manners. Moreover, Nurr1 protects cells from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These findings provide evidence that Nurr1 promotes cell survival through its interacting with and repressing p53, thus implicating that Nurr1 may play an important role in carcinogenesis and other diseases.

70349736076	The Involvement of Retinoic Acid Receptor-α in Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Gene Expression and Affective Disorders	Background: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is considered the central driving force in the stress response and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of depression. Retinoic acid (RA) has been suggested by clinical studies to be associated with affective disorders. Methods: First, hypothalamic tissues of 12 patients with affective disorders and 12 matched control subjects were studied by double-label immunofluorescence to analyze the expression of CRH and retinoic acid receptor-α (RAR-α). Second, critical genes involved in the RA signaling pathways were analyzed in a rat model of depression. Finally, the regulatory effect of RAR-α on CRH gene expression was studied in vitro. Results: We found that the expression of RAR-α was colocalized with CRH neurons in human hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The density of RAR-α-immunoreactive neurons and CRH-RAR-α double-staining neurons was significantly increased in the PVN of patients with affective disorders. The ratio of the CRH-RAR-α double-staining neurons to the CRH-immunoreactive neurons in affective disorder patients was also increased. Recruitment of RAR-α by the CRH promoter was observed in the rat hypothalamus. A dysregulated RA metabolism and signaling was also found in the hypothalamus of a rat model for depression. Finally, in vitro studies demonstrated that RAR-α mediated an upregulation of CRH gene expression. Conclusions: These results suggest that RAR-α might contribute to regulating the activity of CRH neurons in vivo, and the vulnerable character of the critical proteins in RA signaling pathways might provide novel targets for therapeutic strategies for depression. © 2009 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

70350701842	Gp78, an ER associated E3, promotes SOD1 and ataxin-3 degradation	Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and ataxin-3 are two neurodegenerative disease proteins in association with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Machado-Joseph disease/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Both normal and mutant types of SOD1 and ataxin-3 are degraded by the proteasome. It was recently reported that these two proteins are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mammalian gp78 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Here, we show that gp78 interacts with both SOD1 and ataxin-3. Overexpression of gp78 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of these two proteins, whereas knockdown of gp78 stabilizes them. Moreover, gp78 represses aggregate formation of mutant SOD1 and protect cells against mutant SOD1-induced cell death. Furthermore, gp78 is increased in cells transfected with these two mutant proteins as well as in ALS mice. Thus, our results suggest that gp78 functions in the regulation of SOD1 and ataxin-3 to target them for ERAD. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

70449584528	Gene responses to oxygen availability in Kluyveromyces lactis: An insight on the evolution of the oxygen-responding system in yeast	The whole-genome duplication (WGD) may provide a basis for the emergence of the very characteristic life style of Saccharomyces cerevisiae - its fermentation-oriented physiology and its capacity of growing in anaerobiosis. Indeed, we found an over-representation of oxygen-responding genes in the ohnologs of S. cerevisiae. Many of these duplicated genes are present as aerobic/hypoxic(anaerobic) pairs and form a specialized system responding to changing oxygen availability. HYP2/ANB1 and COX5A/COX5B are such gene pairs, and their unique orthologs in the 'non-WGD' Kluyveromyces lactis genome behaved like the aerobic versions of S. cerevisiae. ROX1 encodes a major oxygen-responding regulator in S. cerevisiae. The synteny, structural features and molecular function of putative KlROX1 were shown to be different from that of ROX1. The transition from the K. lactis-type ROX1 to the S. cerevisiae-type ROX1 could link up with the development of anaerobes in the yeast evolution. Bioinformatics and stochastic analyses of the Rox1p-binding site (YYYATTGTTCTC) in the upstream sequences of the S. cerevisiae Rox1p-mediated genes and of the K. lactis orthologs also indicated that K. lactis lacks the specific gene system responding to oxygen limiting environment, which is present in the 'post-WGD' genome of S. cerevisiae. These data suggested that the oxygen-responding system was born for the specialized physiology of S. cerevisiae. © 2009 Fang et al.

71549167018	Oxidative desulfurization of diesel fuel using amphiphilic quaternary ammonium phosphomolybdate catalysts	Phosphomolybdic acid (HPMo) modified respectively with tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC), dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DTAC) and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (HTAC) as the catalysts were prepared and characterized by FT-IR, XRD and SEM. The catalysts were evaluated for the oxidative desulfurization of benzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and straight-run diesel using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Results show that all of the catalysts keep the Keggin structures and are finely dispersed with mixing of quaternary ammonium salts. Hexadecyl chains are more favorable to wrap up DBT to the catalytic center and form stable emulsion system with higher conversion rates of DBT. The shorter dodecyl chains can wrap up BT more suitably and bring smaller steric hindrance, which display higher conversion rates of BT. The oxidative reactions fit apparent first-order kinetics, and the apparent activation energies of DBT are much lower than those of BT. The desulfurization rate of straight-run diesel can be up to 84.4% with the recovery rate of 98.1% catalyzed by [HPMo][HTAC]

72649087184	Degradation of TDP-43 and its pathogenic form by autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system	TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is a nuclear protein functioning in the regulation of transcription and mRNA splicing. TDP-43 is accumulated in ubiquitinated inclusions in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseased brains. However, the pathways involved in the clearance of TDP-43 and its pathogenic form (TDP-25), a truncated form of TDP-43, are still not elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that the protein levels of TDP-43 and TDP-25 were increased in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, or an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, whereas, they were decreased in cells treated with an enhancer of autophagy, trehalose. Furthermore, more protein level changes of TDP-25 than TDP-43 were observed in cells treated with above inhibitors or enhancer. Thus, our data suggest that TDP-43 and TDP-25 are degraded by both proteasome and autophagy with TDP-25 being more regulated. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

77950466719	Studying the influence of operation parameters on heavy and alkali metals partitioning in flue gases	In order to study the distribution and partitioning of heavy and alkali metals in the flue gases of a sewage sludge incinerator, an experiment was carried out in a pilot scale combustor. The results indicated that it was feasible to separate part of metals from flue gases by collecting fly ash at different temperatures. On the basis of their separation temperature, heavy and alkali metals could be divided into three groups: group A included Zn, K and P, which converted from gaseous phase to liquid or solid when temperature was above 600°C. Pb and Cu were the metals of group B, with optimum transformation temperature of 400°C. Na and As belonged to group C, with conversion temperatures of 300°C. Moreover, the effect of temperature gradient on heavy and alkali metal gas-solid transformation was also experimentally investigated. It was observed that the temperature gradient could promote the gas-solid conversion of heavy and alkali metals. However, too high a temperature gradient would suppress the formation of fine particles. The peak of conversion rate for K, Pb and Na occurred at 434°C s

77956231631	DJ-1, a cancer and Parkinson's disease associated protein, regulates autophagy through JNK pathway in cancer cells	Autophagy mediates cellular self-digestion to degrade cytoplasmic proteins and organelles and plays important roles in tumorigenesis. DJ-1 is an oncogene product in association with cancers and tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that knockdown of DJ-1 induces autophagy through activating JNK pathway to promote Beclin 1 transcription, whereas overexpression of DJ-1 inhibits these processes. Moreover, inhibition of JNK pathway by SP600125 blocks autophagy activation and p62 degradation induced by knockdown of DJ-1. Our findings suggest that DJ-1 regulates autophagy in a JNK-dependent manner. Thus, the involvement of DJ-1 in autophagy regulation may be involved in tumorigenesis. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this paper, the effect of various sorbents, temperature and air staging combustion on heavy metals emission are experimentally investigated. The results show that the three sorbents(kaolinite, bauxite, and limestone) have the ability of reducing heavy metals emission. Kaolinite is the optimum sorbent for Pb, bauxite is best for Cd. The higher temperature has a negative effect on heavy metals emission control. It is also found that air staging combustion is not a good method of suppressing heavy metals emission though it is very commonly used in reducing NOx emission. © 2010 IEEE.

77958040685	Administration of embryonic stem cells generates effective antitumor immunity in mice with minor and heavy tumor load	The history of immunizing animals with fetal tissues to generate an antitumor response dates back a century ago. Subsequent reports supported the idea that vaccination with embryonic materials could generate cancer-specific immunity and protect animals from transplan-table and chemically induced tumors. In our study, we found C57 BL/6 mice vaccinated with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) received obvious antitumor immunity, which protected them from the formation and development of lung cancer. Furthermore, we investigated the antitumor effects of administration of ESCs in mice with minor and/or heavy tumor load. The tumor growth was monitored, the proliferation of lymphocytes and secretion of cytokines were examined, and finally the tissue sections were approached by immunohistochemical and apoptosis staining. The results suggested that mice injected with ESCs received obvious tumor inhibition and retardation due to signiicant lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion, which help to rebuild the host's immunity against cancer to some extent and comprise the main part of antitumor immunity. Moreover, mice with minor tumor load received stronger antitumor efect compared with mice with heavy tumor load, may be due to relatively intact immune system. Thus, besides their function as prophylactic vaccines, administration of ESCs could be a potential treatment for cancer, which obviously prevent and control the proliferation and development of malignant tumors. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

77957676969	Dendritic cell nuclear protein-1, a novel depression-related protein, upregulates corticotropin-releasing hormone expression	The recently discovered dendritic cell nuclear protein-1 is the product of a novel candidate gene for major depression. The A allele encodes full-length dendritic cell nuclear protein-1, while the T allele encodes a premature termination of translation at codon number 117 on chromosome 5. In the present study we investigate whether the two forms of dendritic cell nuclear protein-1 might act on corticotropin-releasing hormone, which plays a crucial role in the stress response and in the pathogenesis of depression. The messenger RNA expression of dendritic cell nuclear protein-1 appeared to be increased in the laser micro-dissected paraventricular nucleus of patients with depression compared with control subjects. Dendritic cell nuclear protein-1 was also found to be co-localized with corticotropin-releasing hormone in paraventricular nucleus neurons. Moreover, full-length dendritic cell nucleus protein-1 bound to and transactivated the promoter of corticotropin-releasing hormone in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We propose that full-length dendritic cell nucleus protein-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders by enhancing corticotropin-releasing hormone expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. © 2010 The Author.

77957840160	Omi/HtrA2 is a positive regulator of autophagy that facilitates the degradation of mutant proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases	Omi, also known as high temperature requirement factor A2 (HtrA2), is a serine protease that was originally identified as a proapoptotic protein. Like Smac/Diablo, it antagonizes inhibitor of apoptosis proteins when released into the cytosol on apoptotic stimulation. Loss of its protease activity in mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) mice is associated with neurodegeneration. However, the detailed mechanisms by which Omi regulates the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease remain largely unknown. We report here that Omi participates in the pivotal cellular degradation process known as autophagy. It activates autophagy through digestion of Hax-1, a Bcl-2 family-related protein that represses autophagy in a Beclin-1 (mammalian homologue of yeast ATG6)-dependent pathway. Moreover, Omi-induced autophagy facilitates the degradation of neurodegenerative proteins such as pathogenic A53T α-synuclein and truncated polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, as well as the endogenous autophagy substrate p62. Knockdown of Omi decreases the basal level of autophagy and increases the level of the above target proteins. Furthermore, S276C Omi, the protease-defective mutant found in mnd2 mice, fails to regulate autophagy. Increased autophagy substrates and the formation of aggregate structures are observed in the brains of mnd2 mice. These results identify Omi as a novel regulator of autophagy and suggest that Omi might be important in the cellular quality control of proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

78649653044	Parkin mono-ubiquitinates Bcl-2 and regulates autophagy	Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of protein substrates. The mutations in the parkin gene can lead to a loss of function of parkin and cause autosomal recessive juvenile onset parkinsonism. Recently, parkin was reported to be involved in the regulation of mitophagy. Here, we identify the Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic and autophagy inhibitory protein, as a substrate for parkin. Parkin directly binds to Bcl-2 via its C terminus and mediates the mono-ubiquitination of Bcl-2, which increases the steady-state levels of Bcl-2. Overexpression of parkin, but not its ligase-deficient forms, decreases autophagy marker LC3 conversion, whereas knockdown of parkin increases LC3 II levels. In HeLa cells, a parkin-deficient cell line, knockdown of parkin does not change LC3 conversion. Moreover, overexpression of parkin enhances the interactions between Bcl-2 and Beclin 1. Our results provide evidence that parkin mono-ubiquitinates Bcl-2 and regulates autophagy via Bcl-2. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

78649659435	Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of dysbindin-1, a schizophrenia-related protein, regulates synapsin I expression	Dysbindin-1 is a 50-kDa coiled-coil-containing protein encoded by the gene DTNBP1 (dystrobrevin-binding protein 1), a candidate genetic factor for schizophrenia. Genetic variations in this gene confer a susceptibility to schizophrenia through a decreased expression of dysbindin-1. It was reported that dysbindin-1 regulates the expression of presynaptic proteins and the release of neurotransmitters. However, the precise functions of dysbindin-1 are largely unknown. Here, we show that dysbindin-1 is a novel nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and translocated to the nucleus upon treatment with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of exportin-1/CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Dysbindin-1 harbors a functional nuclear export signal necessary for its nuclear export, and the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of dysbindin-1 affects its regulation of synapsin I expression. In brains of sandy mice, a dysbindin-1-null strain that displays abnormal behaviors related to schizophrenia, the protein and mRNA levels of synapsin I are decreased. These findings demonstrate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of dysbindin-1 regulates synapsin I expression and thus may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

78649433615	The β-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, induces human gastric cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via inhibiting nuclear factor κB signaling	In a recent clinical observation, the growth of endothelial tumors, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, was repressed by the non-selective-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. In this study, we evaluated whether β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), matrix metallo-proteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were involved in modulating cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by propranolol in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines (SGC-7901 and BGC-823) in vitro. Our results showed that the propranolol treatment inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of β-ARs in this cellular response. Propranolol-induced growth inhibition was associated with G0/G1 arrest and G2/M arrest depending upon the concentration. In addition, propranolol also induced apoptosis in both cell lines, as determined by Annexin V staining assay. Furthermore, propranolol decreased the level of NF-κB and then downregulated VEGF, Cox-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Collectively, these results suggested that propranolol repressed gastric cancer cell growth through the inhibition of β-ARs and the downstream NF-κB-VEGF/MMP-2/9/COX-2 pathway.

78651066261	Quantitative protein and mRNA profiling shows selective post-transcriptional control of protein expression by vasopressin in kidney cells	Previous studies in yeast have supported the view that post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundances may be more important than previously believed. Here we ask the question: "In a physiological regulatory process (the response of mammalian kidney cells to the hormone vasopressin), what fraction of the expressed proteome undergoes a change in abundance and what fraction of the regulated proteins have corresponding changes in mRNA levels?" In humans and other mammals, vasopressin fulfills a vital homeostatic role (viz. regulation of renal water excretion) by regulating the water channel aquaporin-2 in collecting duct cells. To address the question posed, we utilized large-scale quantitative protein mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing stable isotopic labeling in cultured mpkCCD cells ('SILAC') coupled with transcriptomic profiling using oligonucleotide expression arrays (Affymetrix). Preliminary studies analyzing two nominally identical control samples by SILAC LC-MS/MS yielded a relative S.D. of 13% (for ratios), establishing the precision of the SILAC approach in our hands. We quantified nearly 3000 proteins with nontargeted SILAC LC-MS/MS, comparing vasopressin- versus vehicle-treated samples. Of these proteins 786 of them were quantified in each of 3 experiments, allowing statistical analysis and 188 of these showed significant vasopressin-induced changes in abundance, including aquaporin-2 (20-fold increase). Among the proteins with statistically significant abundance changes, a large fraction (at least one-third) was found to lack changes in the corresponding mRNA species (despite sufficient statistical power), indicating that post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance plays an important role in the vasopressin response. Bioinformatic analysis of the regulated proteins (versus all transcripts) shows enrichment of glutathione S-transferase isoforms as well as proteins involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The latter suggests that long-term regulatory processes may contribute to actomyosin-dependent trafficking of the water channel aquaporin-2. The results provide impetus for increased focus on translational regulation and regulation of protein degradation in physiological control in mammalian epithelial cells. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79955613190	A comparison of Twist and E-cadherin protein expression in primary non-small-cell lung carcinoma and corresponding metastases	Objective: The metastasis of solid tumors is directly or indirectly responsible for most cancer-related deaths. It has already been known that in non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells, up-regulation of Twist (a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor) can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition through down-regulation of E-cadherin. The main aim of this study was to determine whether the expression of Twist and E-cadherin differs between primary and metastatic lung carcinoma and to correlate Twist and E-cadherin expression in primary and metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Methods: Thirteen patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma and hematogenous metastases were studied in retrospect, and Twist and E-cadherin were detected by immunohistochemistry in 26 tissue samples from the 13 patients. Results: We demonstrated that the expression of Twist was higher in metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma tissues than in primary non-small-cell lung carcinoma (p= 0.008) and discordance of Twist expression was observed in 11 (85%) patients. For E-cadherin, 12 cases (92%) showed discordance between primary tumor and metastasis (p= 0.002): E-cadherin expressed higher in the primary tumor than in the metastasis in 12 cases. We also found that increased Twist expression was correlated with decreased membranous E-cadherin expression (p= 0.009). Conclusions: Our data imply that Twist induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small-cell lung carcinoma by reducing E-cadherin, then promoting metastasis. © 2011 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

The kinetics of the heterogeneous hydrodesulfurization of coal with coke-oven gas was investigated. The special rate constant obtained showed a true Arrhenius temperature dependence. Some amount of potassium hydroxide, which was introduced into the coal, significantly enhanced the coal sulfur removal.

79957991349	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation system regulates aggregation and degradation of mutant neuroserpin	Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of neuroserpin polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cortical and subcortical neurons in the CNS because of neuroserpin point mutations. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is involved in mutant neuroserpin degradation. In this study, we demonstrate that two ER-associated E3 ligases, Hrd1 and gp78, are involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of mutant neuroserpin. Overexpression of Hrd1 and gp78 decreases the mutant neuroserpin protein level, whereas Hrd1 and gp78 knockdown increases mutant neuroserpin stability. Moreover, ERAD impairment by mutant valosin-containing protein increases the mutant neuroserpin protein level and aggregate formation. Thus, these findings identify mutant neuroserpin as an ERAD target and show that Hrd1 and gp78 mediate mutant neuroserpin turnover through the ERAD pathway. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

However, the mitochondrial and energy/metabolism-related properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs), the stem cell-like subpopulation in tumor masses, remain unknown. In our study, we compared the masses of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), oxygen/glucose consumption, and the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP between lung CSCs (LCSCs) and non-LCSCs. In addition, the change in features during differentiation was examined. Some mitochondrial and energy metabolism-related properties, such as perinuclear mitochondrial distribution, a lower quantity of mtDNA, higher Δψm, lower oxygen/glucose consumption, and lower intracellular concentrations of ROS and ATP, can be used as indicators of LCSCs.

80051579313	The KDEL receptor induces autophagy to promote the clearance of neurodegenerative disease-related proteins	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in neurodegenerative diseases, and the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu motif) receptor (KDELR) plays a key role in ER quality control and in the ER stress response. The subcellular distribution of KDELR is dynamic and related to its ligand binding status and its expression level. Here, we show that KDELR mRNA is upregulated upon thapsigargin treatment, which induces ER stress. Moreover, overexpressed KDELR partially redistributes to the lysosome and activates autophagy. The R169N mutant, a ligand binding-defective form of KDELR, and D193N, a transport-defective form of KDELR, both fail to trigger autophagy. Overexpression of KDELR activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Both the activation of ERKs and autophagy induced by KDELR could be blocked by PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen extracellular kinase 1 (MEK1). The overexpression of some neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked G93A superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), Parkinson's disease-associated A53T alpha-synuclein and Huntington's disease-related expanded huntingtin, increase the mRNA levels of KDELR. Moreover, the overexpressed KDELR promotes the clearance of these disease proteins through autophagy. Taken together, our data provide evidence that KDELR, as a novel inducer of autophagy, participates in the degradation of misfolded neurodegenerative disease-related proteins. © 2011 IBRO.

80053495030	Recovery of thiophen in simulative crude benzol by extraction with ionic liquid	To recover thiophen in crude benzol, the ionic liquid was synthesized by the reaction of equimolar N-methylimidazole with trimethyl phosphate. The ionic liquid was used as extraction desulfurization agent to remove thiophen in simulative crude benzol, and the used ionic liquid was regenerated to recover thiophen. The effects of extraction time, extraction temperature, the volume ratio of ionic liquid to simulative crude benzol, the repetitive performance of the ionic liquid on the rate of thiophen removal from the simulative crude benzol were investigated, and the recovery of thiophen during the ionic liquid regeneration was discussed. The results show that optimal desulfurization conditions are 30 min, 40°C and V(ionic liquid):V(simulative crude benzene)=1:1, the sulfur removal is 30.48%; the ionic liquid could be used repeatedly for 3 times. The used ionic liquids could be regenerated and about 66.20% of the thiophen is recovered during regeneration by vacuum distillation. After regeneration, the extraction desulfurization performance of the ionic liquid remains almost unchanged.

80054866138	Dysbindin-1, a schizophrenia-related protein, facilitates neurite outgrowth by promoting the transcriptional activity of p53	Genetic variations in the DTNBP1 gene (encoding the protein dysbindin-1) have been implicated as risk factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Previous studies have indicated that dysbindin-1 functions in the regulation of synaptic activity. Recently, dysbindin-1 has also been documented to be involved in neuronal development. In this study, we identified necdin as a binding partner of dysbindin-1 using a yeast two-hybrid screen. Dysbindin-1 recruits necdin to the cytoplasm, thereby attenuating the repressive effects of necdin on p53 transcriptional activity. Knockdown of dysbindin-1, like knockdown of p53, greatly decreases the expressions of the p53 target genes coronin 1b and rab13, which are required for neurite outgrowth. Moreover, overexpression of p53 restores the neurite outgrowth blocked by dysbindin-1 knockdown. In brains of dysbindin-1 null mice (the sandy strain), p21, Coronin 1b and Rab13 levels are reduced. Furthermore, primary cultured cortical neurons from sandy mice display neurite outgrowth defects when compared with those from wild-type mice. Thus, our data provide evidence that dysbindin-1 has an important role in neurite outgrowth through its regulation of p53's transcriptional activity. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

83755195500	Study on the effect of adding coke powder on coke quality for coal blending	Coke powder (CP) added as the substitution of lean coal for coal blending was carried out in 5 kg coke oven. The influences of the particle size, the particle size interval and the amount of CP on the coke quality were investigated. The interfaces in which CP added inset the coke were discussed by means of microplariscope and SEM to confirm the effect of the microstructure on the coke quality. The results showed that the optimal particle size interval, the particle size and the amount of CP were 0.1∼0.2 mm, <0.3 mm and 3 wt%, respectively.

The influences of addition amount (0.25%∼1.25%) and size distribution (0∼2.5 mm) for DBF on the quality of the coke were investigated. The results showed that the influence on the quality of the coke was little when amount of DBF was less than 0.25% and particle size was from 0.5 mm to 1 mm, but the quality of the coke decreased obviously when addition amount was more than 0.25% and the size was larger than 1 mm.

84858007356	DJ-1 inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by blocking pro-caspase-8 recruitment to FADD	DJ-1 was initially identified as an oncogene product involved in human tumorigenesis in cooperation with Ras. Increased DJ-1 expression is associated with tumorigenesis in many cancers, whereas the loss of DJ-1 function is linked to an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that DJ-1 protects cells from TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which DJ-1 is involved is still largely unknown. Here we show that DJ-1 inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by blocking Fas-associated protein death domain (FADD)-mediated pro-caspase-8 activation. Wild-type DJ-1, but not the PD-associated mutant L166P, binds to FADD to inhibit the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DJ-1 competes with pro-caspase-8 to bind to FADD at the death effector domain, thereby repressing the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-8 to the active form of caspase-8. Thus, our study suggests that DJ-1 protects against TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the regulation of DISC formation. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84859223274	Correlation between VEGF-C mRNA expression and lymph node metastasis in breast cancer	Objective: To study the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) in breast cancer and its correlation with clinicopathological indexes of lymph node metastasis. Methods: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was adopted in detecting VEGF-CmRNA expression in 60 cases of breast infiltrative tubular cancer. We took 15 cases of breast fibroadenoma as controls. Results: The positive rate and degree of VEGF-CmRNA expression were higher in the breast cancer group than in the control group (P<0.01). VEGF-CmRNA expression was significantly higher in the lymph node metastasis-positive group than in lymph node metastasis-negative group (P<0.05). VEGF-CmRNA expression was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (r=0.638, P<0.01). Conclusion: VEGF-CmRNA expression was higher in breast cancer and it promoted lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.

84860168132	Antagonist effect of triptolide on AKT activation by truncated retinoid X receptor-alpha	Background: Retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRα) is a key member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. We recently demonstrated that proteolytic cleavage of RXRα resulted in production of a truncated product, tRXRα, which promotes cancer cell survival by activating phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. However, how the tRXRα-mediated signaling pathway in cancer cells is regulated remains elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings: We screened a natural product library for tRXRα targeting leads and identified that triptolide, an active component isolated from traditional Chinese herb Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F, could modulate tRXRα-mediated cancer cell survival pathway in vitro and in animals. Our results reveal that triptolide strongly induces cancer cell apoptosis dependent on intracellular tRXRα expression levels, demonstrating that tRXRα serves as an important intracellular target of triptolide. We show that triptolide selectively induces tRXRα degradation and inhibits tRXRα-dependent AKT activity without affecting the full-length RXRα. Interestingly, such effects of triptolide are due to its activation of p38. Although triptolide also activates Erk1/2 and MAPK pathways, the effects of triptolide on tRXRα degradation and AKT activity are only reversed by p38 siRNA and p38 inhibitor. In addition, the p38 inhibitor potently inhibits tRXRα interaction with p85α leading to AKT inactivation. Our results demonstrate an interesting novel signaling interplay between p38 and AKT through tRXRα mediation. We finally show that targeting tRXRα by triptolide strongly activates TNFα death signaling and enhances the anticancer activity of other chemotherapies Conclusions/Significance: Our results identify triptolide as a new xenobiotic regulator of the tRXRα-dependent survival pathway and provide new insight into the mechanism by which triptolide acts to induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Triptolide represents one of the most promising therapeutic leads of natural products of traditional Chinese medicine with unfortunate side-effects. Our findings will offer new strategies to develop improved triptolide analogs for cancer therapy. © 2012 Lu et al.

84862800195	H1-antihistamines induce vacuolation in astrocytes through macroautophagy	H1-antihistamines induce vacuolation in vascular smooth muscle cells, which may contribute to their cardiovascular toxicity. The CNS toxicity of H1-antihistamines may also be related to their non-receptor-mediated activity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether H1-antihistamines induce vacuolation in astrocytes and the mechanism involved. The H1-antihistamines induced large numbers of giant vacuoles in astrocytes. Such vacuoles were marked with both the lysosome marker Lysotracker Red and the alkalescent fluorescence dye monodansylcadaverine, which indicated that these vacuoles were lysosome-like acidic vesicles. Quantitative analysis of monodansylcadaverine fluorescence showed that the effect of H1-antihistamines on vacuolation in astrocytes was dose-dependent, and was alleviated by extracellular acidification, but aggravated by extracellular alkalization. The order of potency to induce vacuolation at high concentrations of H1-antihistamines (diphenhydramine>pyrilamine>astemizole>triprolidine) corresponded to their pKa ranking. Co-treatment with histamine and the histamine receptor-1 agonist trifluoromethyl toluidide did not inhibit the vacuolation. Bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar (V)-ATPase inhibitor, which inhibits intracellular vacuole or vesicle acidification, clearly reversed the vacuolation and intracellular accumulation of diphenhydramine. The macroautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine largely reversed the percentage of LC3-positive astrocytes induced by diphenhydramine, while only partly reversing the number of monodansylcadaverine-labeled vesicles.

84862200068	Identifying MicroRNA-mRNA regulatory network in colorectal cancer by a combination of expression profile and bioinformatics analysis	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression by regulating post-transcriptional gene expression. However, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network is far from being fully understood. The objective of this study is to identify the colorectal cancer (CRC) specific miRNAs and their target mRNAs using a multi-step approach.Results: A multi-step approach combining microarray miRNA and mRNA expression profile and bioinformatics analysis was adopted to identify the CRC specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. First, 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and 2916 mRNAs from CRC samples and their corresponding normal epithelial tissues were identified by miRNA and mRNA microarray, respectively. Secondly, 22 dysregulated miRNAs and their 58 target mRNAs (72 miRNA-mRNA pairs) were identified by a combination of Pearson's correlation analysis and prediction by databases TargetScan and miRanda. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these miRNA-mRNAs pairs were involved in Wnt signaling pathway. Additionally, 6 up-regulated miRNAs (mir-21, mir-223, mir-224, mir-29a, mir-29b, and mir-27a) and 4 down-regulated predicted target mRNAs (SFRP1, SFRP2, RNF138, and KLF4) were selected to validate the expression level and their anti-correlationship in an extended cohort of CRC patients by qRT-PCR. Except for mir-27a, the differential expression and their anti-correlationship were proven. Finally, a transfection assay was performed to validate a regulatory relationship between mir-29a and KLF4 at both RNA and protein levels.Conclusions: Seventy-two miRNA-mRNA pairs combined by 22 dysregulated miRNAs and their 58 target mRNAs identified by the multi-step approach appear to be involved in CRC tumorigenesis. The results in our study were worthwhile to further investigation via a functional study to fully understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms of miRNA in CRC. © 2012 Fu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862295360	Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy	In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84863243983	MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a protects wild-type p53 cancer cells from paclitaxel	The p53 pathway has an important role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Downregulated levels of p53 have been shown to increase resistance to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. MDM2 (murine double minute 2) is able to bind p53 and modulate its transcriptional activity and stability. We studied the effect of Nutlin-3a, an MDM2 antagonist, on the response of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, A549 (p53+/+) and H1299 (p53-/-), to paclitaxel (Taxol). A549 cells treated with Nutlin-3a plus paclitaxel showed a significant increase in MDM2 and wild-type p53 protein, a marked increase in the number of cells in the G0-G1 and G2-M phases, and a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. The percentage of apoptotic A549 cells treated with 10 μmol/L Nutlin-3a plus 10 nmol/L paclitaxel was significantly lower than those treated with paclitaxel alone, and was also lower than that observed in H1299 cells. MTT assays demonstrated that Nutlin-3a plus paclitaxel also significantly reduced the sensitivity of A549 cells to paclitaxel compared with that of H1299 cells. In conclusion, Nutlin-3a mediates the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel depending on p53 status. It may also protect wild-type p53 cells from mitotic chemotherapeutics. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84863377485	Preparation of high surface area, graphitic porous carbon monolith using magnetite nanoparticles as catalyst and porogens	A method to prepare monolithic porous graphitic carbon with high surface area was investigated using nanosize monodispersed magnetite particles (~10 nm) as graphitization catalysts and a porogen template, and an oligomer derived from the polymerization of 2, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid with formaldehyde catalyzed by sodium carbonate as carbon source. The magnetite/oligomer composites were carbonized at 700-900°C under a nitrogen atmosphere to generate graphitized carbon composites. Finally, monolithic porous graphitic carbon was obtained after HCl treatment to remove the iron-based particles. Results show that carbonization temperature has a great influence on the graphitization degree and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the resultant products. The BET surface areas decreased and the graphitization degree of the products increased with carbonization temperature from 700 to 900°C. At a low carbonization temperature of 700°C, the templating effect of the magnetite particles (as porogens) can be clearly observed. Highly graphitic carbon with a high surface area can be obtained at 800°C.

84865207113	Ataxin-3 regulates aggresome formation of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) by editing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains	Polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins, especially K63- linked polyubiquitination, is thought to be associated with the formation of inclusion bodies. However, it is not well explored whether appropriate editing of the different types of ubiquitin linkages by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) affects the dynamics of inclusion bodies. In this study, we report that a specific DUB, ataxin-3, is required for the efficient recruitment of the neurodegenerative disease-associated protein copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) to aggresomes. The overexpression of ataxin-3 promotes mutant SOD1 aggresome formation by trimming K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Moreover, knockdown of ataxin-3 decreases mutant SOD1 aggresome formation and increases cell death induced by mutant SOD1. Thus, our data suggest that the sequestration of misfolded SOD1 into aggresomes, which is driven by ataxin-3, plays an important role in attenuating protein misfolding-induced cell toxicity. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84865291933	The protease omi cleaves the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK1 to inhibit microglial activation	Inflammation in Parkinson's disease is closely associated with disease pathogenesis. Mutations in Omi, which encodes the protease Omi, are linked to neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease in humans and in mouse models. The severe neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation that occur in mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) mice result from loss of the protease activity of Omi by the point mutation S276C; however, the substrates of Omi that induce neurodegeneration are unknown. We showed that Omi was required for the production of inflammatory molecules by microglia, which are the resident macrophages in the central nervous system. Omi suppressed the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal- regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by cleaving the upstream kinase MEK1 (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase 1). Knockdown of Omi in microglial cell lines led to activation of ERK1/2 and resulted in degradation of IκBα [α inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (NF-kappa;B)], resulting in NF-kappa;B activation and the expression of genes encoding inflammatory molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase. The production of inflammatory molecules induced by the knockdown of Omi was blocked by the MEK1-specific inhibitor U0126. Furthermore, expression of the protease-deficient S276C Omi mutant in a microglial cell line had no effect on MEK1 cleavage or ERK1/2 activation. In the brains of mnd2 mice, we observed increased transcription of several genes encoding inflammatory molecules, as well as activation of astrocytes and microglia. Therefore, our study demonstrates that Omi is an intrinsic cellular factor that inhibits neuroinflammation.

84865646232	Hax-1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome dependent on its PEST sequence	Background: HS-1-associated protein X-1 (Hax-1), is a multifunctional protein that has sequence homology to Bcl-2 family members. HAX-1 knockout animals reveal that it plays an essential protective role in the central nervous system against various stresses. Homozygous mutations in the HAX-1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive forms of severe congenital neutropenia along with neurological symptoms. The protein level of Hax-1 has been shown to be regulated by cellular protease cleavage or by transcriptional suppression upon stimulation.Results: Here, we report a novel post-translational mechanism for regulation of Hax-1 levels in mammalian cells. We identified that PEST sequence, a sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine and threonine, is responsible for its poly-ubiquitination and rapid degradation. Hax-1 is conjugated by K48-linked ubiquitin chains and undergoes a fast turnover by the proteasome system. A deletion mutant of Hax-1 that lacks the PEST sequence is more resistant to the proteasomal degradation and exerts more protective effects against apoptotic stimuli than wild type Hax-1.Conclusion: Our data indicate that Hax-1 is a short-lived protein and that its PEST sequence dependent fast degradation by the proteasome may contribute to the rapid cellular responses upon different stimulations. © 2012 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84866173551	Confirmation of histology of PET positive lymph nodes recovered by hand-video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery	PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography) is an advanced diagnostic imaging device that combines both PET and an X-ray CT. This study evaluates the effects of PET/CT on detecting primary tumors and metastases, and looks at the therapeutic effect of minimally invasive surgery on esophageal cancer patients. Eighty patients with esophageal cancer were enrolled in the study between January, 2004 and December, 2007, who were randomly divided into two groups of 40, one of which was treated with hand-video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (HVATS) esophagectomy and one of which was treated with conventional surgery. All patients underwent a PET/CT scan 2-3. weeks before their operation, and their cervical, thoracic and upper abdominal lymph nodes were biopsied. All the primary esophageal lesions showed high FDG uptake. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) was 3.78-25.64 (11.73 ± 5.32), while the mean SUV was 3.65 = 16.92 (9.12 ± 4.37). Using 2.5 as the SUV standard, all esophageal lesions were detected by PET/CT image. Of the 80 patients, 53 had lymph nodal metastases, with a total of 142 metastatic lymph nodes, which showed high FDG uptake. The maximum SUV was 2.77-14.63 (7.98 ± 3.25), and the mean SUV was 2.31-12.84 (5.34 ± 3.19). The visual analysis from the PET/CT scan showed a sensitivity of 86.62%, a specificity of 95.85%, a positive predictive value of 93.89%, a negative predictive value of 90.69% and an accuracy of 91.94%. The PET/CT scan showed a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting primary esophageal cancer and lymph nodal metastases. The mean post-surgery life expectancies for patients undergoing HVATS and conventional surgery are 27.93. months and 28.05. months, respectively. The two groups showed no statistically significant difference. We thus conclude that PET/CT combined with HVATS is a new choice for esophageal carcinoma patients. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84869741103	Association between Circulating Levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and Lung Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis	Background: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system was documented to play a predominant role in neoplasia. As lung cancer is one of the most malignant cancers, we conducted a meta-analysis in order to investigate the strength of association between circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels and lung cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify all prospective case-control studies and case-control studies on circulating IGFs and IGFBPs levels. Six nested case-control studies (1 043 case subjects and 11 472 control participants) and eight case-control studies (401 case subjects and 343 control participants) were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled measure was calculated as the inverse variance-weighted mean of the natural logarithm of multivariate adjusted OR with 95% CIs for highest vs. lowest levels to assess the association of circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations and lung cancer. Standard mean difference (SMD) was also calculated to indicate the difference of the circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations between the lung cancer case group and the control group. Of the nested case-control studies, ORs for the highest vs. lowest levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were 1.047 (95% CI: [0.802,1.367], P = 0.736) and 0.960 (95%CI: [0.591,1.559], P = 0.868) respectively; and SMDs were -0.079 (95%CI:[-0.169, 0.011], P = 0.086) and -0.097 (95%CI:[-0.264,0.071], P = 0.258) for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 respectively. As to the case-control studies, SMDs were 0.568 (95%CI:[-0.035, 1.171], P = 0.065) and -0.780 (95%CI:[-1.358, -0.201], P = 0.008) for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 respectively. Conclusions/Significance: Inverse association was shown between IGFBP-3 and lung cancer in the case-control studies,and the circulating level of IGFBP-3 underwent a decline during tumorogenesis and development of lung cancer, which suggested IGFBP-3 a promising candidate for the biomarker of lung cancer. © 2012 Cao et al.

84870246959	Kinetics of glycolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) under microwave irradiation	The glycolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was carried out using excess ethylene glycol (EG) in the presence of zinc acetate as catalysts under microwave irradiation. The effects of particle size, microwave power, the weight ratio of EG to PET, the weight ratio of catalyst to PET, reaction temperature and stirring speed on the yield of bis(hydroxyethyl terephthalate)(BHET) were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the glycolysis rate was significantly influenced by stirring speed and initial particle size. The optimal parameters of glycolysis reactions were the weight ratio of catalyst to PET of 1%, the weight ratio of EG to PET of 5, 500 W and 196°C, the yield of BHET reached to 78% at only 35 min. The glycolysis products were analyzed and identified by FTIR, differential scanning calorimetry, and elemental analysis. The kinetics of glycolysis of PET under microwave irradiation could be interpreted by the shrinking core model of the film diffusion control. The apparent activation energy was evaluated using the Arrhenius equation and it was found to be 36.5 KJ/mol, which was lower compared to the same process using conventional heating. The experimental results also showed that the reaction time was significantly decreased under microwave irradiation as compared with it by conventional heating. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

84870999850	The NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 is required for programmed necrosis	Although initially viewed as unregulated, increasing evidence suggests that cellular necrosis often proceeds through a specific molecular program. In particular, death ligands such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α activate necrosis by stimulating the formation of a complex containing receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3). Relatively little is known regarding how this complex formation is regulated. Here, we show that the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 binds constitutively to RIP3 and that deletion or knockdown of SIRT2 prevents formation of the RIP1-RIP3 complex in mice. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 blocks cellular necrosis induced by TNF-α. We further demonstrate that RIP1 is a critical target of SIRT2-dependent deacetylation. Using gain-and loss-of-function mutants, we demonstrate that acetylation of RIP1 lysine 530 modulates RIP1-RIP3 complex formation and TNF-α-stimulated necrosis. In the setting of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, RIP1 is deacetylated in a SIRT2-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the hearts of Sirt2-/-mice, or wild-type mice treated with a specific pharmacological inhibitor of SIRT2, show marked protection from ischaemic injury. Taken together, these results implicate SIRT2 as an important regulator of programmed necrosis and indicate that inhibitors of this deacetylase may constitute a novel approach to protect against necrotic injuries, including ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84871580936	Identification of MXRA5 as a novel biomarker in colorectal cancer	In our previous study, significantly high expression levels of matrix-remodeling associated 5 (MXRA5) were identified in fresh-cultured colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared with their normal adjacent mucosa by differential secretome analysis. Whether MXRA5 is a potential serum biomarker of CRC has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MXRA5 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of CRC patients. The MXRA5 expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 20 colorectal adenoma tissues, 156 CRC tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal mucosa. Relative quantity (RQ) value and immunoreactive score (IRS) were used for quantitative assessment. The staining for MXRA5 protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm of CRC cells. All CRC tissues were positively stained, with a higher expression rate (IRS>4) of 67% (105/156), and a lower expression rate (IRS≤4) of 33% (51/156). Meanwhile, their corresponding normal tissues exhibited little positive staining; the higher expression rate was 0% (0/156) and the lower expression rate was 25% (16/156). Additionally, more than half of the adenoma tissues were positively stained; the higher expression rate was 15% (3/20) and the lower expression rate was 50% (10/20). The MXRA5 protein positive staining rates were significantly correlated with the lesion sites (colon vs. rectum, 76 vs. 59%), TNM staging (I+II vs. III+IV, 56 vs. 73%) and metastasis (present vs. absent; 76 vs. 61%) with the most high positive staining rate observable in omental metastasis (82%). However, MXRA5 mRNA expression levels showed no significant differences between CRC tissues and their corresponding normal tissues, and no significant correlation between IRS and corresponding RQ value was observed. In this study, we present the first evaluation of MXRA5 protein expression in CRC tissue. Our results revealed that MXRA5 protein is aberrantly expressed in CRC tissues, and has potential value in early detection of CRC and prediction of omental metastasis.

84871948626	Targeting truncated retinoid X receptor-α by CF31 induces TNF-α-dependent apoptosis	A truncated version of retinoid X receptor-α, tRXR-α, promotes cancer cell survival by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. However, targeting the tRXR-α-mediated survival pathway for cancer treatment remains to be explored.Wereport here our identi fication of a new natural product molecule, CF31, a xanthone isolated from Cratoxylum formosum ssp. pruniflorum, and the biologic evaluation of its regulation of the tRXR-α-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. CF31 binds RXR-α and its binding results in inhibition of RXR-α transactivation. Through RXR-α mutational analysis and computational studies, we show that Arg316 of RXR-α, known to form salt bridges with certain RXR-α ligands, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), is not required for the antagonist effect of CF31, showing a distinct binding mode. Evaluation of several CF31 analogs suggests that the antagonist effect is mainly attributed to an interference with Leu451 of helix H12 in RXR-α. CF31 is a potent inhibitor of AKTactivation in various cancer cell lines. When combined with TNF-α, it suppresses TNF-α activation of AKT by inhibiting TNF-α-induced tRXR-α interaction with the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K. CF31 inhibition of TNF-α activation of AKT also results in TNF-α-dependent activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis. Together, our results show that CF31 is an effective converter of TNF-α signaling from survival to death by targeting tRXR-α in a unique mode and suggest that identification of a natural product that targets an RXRmediated cell survival pathway that regulates PI3K/AKT may offer a new therapeutic strategy to kill cancer cells. ©2012 AACR.

84872690548	Glycolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) over Mg-Al mixed oxides catalysts derived from hydrotalcites	Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was depolymerized by ethylene glycol (EG) in the presence of Mg-Al hydrotalcites and their corresponding mixed oxides as solid base catalysts. Mg-Al hydrotalcites with different Mg/Al molar ratios were prepared; it was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) that the materials had hydrotalcite structure. Compared with their corresponding precursors, Mg-Al mixed oxides obtained by the calcination of hydrotalcites exhibited higher catalytic activity for the glycolysis of PET. Furthermore, Mg-Al mixed oxides calcinated at 500 C with Mg/Al molar ratio of 3 offered the highest catalytic activity for the glycolysis of PET. The experimental results showed that the basicity of catalyst played an important role on the glycolysis activity. The solid catalyst could be easily separated and reused after calcinations again. The influences of experimental parameters on the yield of bis(hydroxyethyl terephthalate)(BHET) were investigated. The evolution of the glycolysis of PET was described by infrared spectroscopy (IR), viscosity-average molecular weight, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84873745782	MicroRNA-143 functions as a tumor suppressor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide with a poor prognosis. MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are a class of naturally occurring small noncoding RNAs and play an important role in cancer initiation and development. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression levels of miR-143 and miR-145 were significantly decreased in ESCC tissues in comparison with adjacent normal esophageal squamous tissues(NESTs). Furthermore, an inverse correlation between miR-143 and tumor invasion depth and lymph node metastasis was observed. The enforced expression of miR-143 induced growth suppression and apoptosis of ESCC cells. Rescue of miR-143 significantly suppressed the ESCC cells migration and invasion capabilities. Moreover, we show that functions of miR-143 in ESCC are mediated at least in part by the inhibition of extracellular signal regulated kinase-5(ERK-5) activity. These results prove that miR-143 may act as a tumor suppressor in ESCC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84874304655	SKF83959 is a potent allosteric modulator of sigma-1 receptor	SKF83959 (3-methyl-6-chloro-7,8-hydroxy-1-[3-methylphenyl]- 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine), an atypical dopamine receptor-1 (D1 receptor) agonist, has shown many D1 receptor-independent effects, such as neuroprotection, blockade of Na1 channel, and promotion of spontaneous glutamate release, which resemble the effects of the sigma-1 receptor activation. In the present work, we explored the potential modulation of SKF83959 on the sigma-1 receptor. The results indicated that SKF83959 dramatically promoted the binding of 3H(1)-pentazocine (a selective sigma-1 receptor agonist) to the sigma-1 receptor in brain and liver tissues but produced no effect on 3H-progesterone binding (a sigma-1 receptor antagonist). The saturation assay and the dissociation kinetics assay confirmed the allosteric effect. We further demonstrated that the SKF83959 analogs, such as SCH22390 [(R)-(1)-7-chloro-8- hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride] and SKF38393 [(+/-)-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-( 1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol hydrobromide], also showed the similar allosteric effect on the sigma-1 receptor in the liver tissue but not in the brain tissue. Moreover, all three tested chemicals elicited no significant effect on 3H-1,3-di(2-tolyl)- guanidine (3H-DTG) binding to the sigma-2 receptor. The present data uncovered a new role of SKF83959 and its analogs on the sigma-1 receptor, which, in turn, may reveal the underlying mechanism for the D1 receptor-independent effect of the drug.

The cells or the cell lysates were subsequently subjected to immunofluorescence assay, immunoprecipitation assay, or immunoblot analysis. In vitro pulldown assay was used to study the interaction of p62 with Bcl-2.Results:Overexpression of p62 significantly increased the basal level of autophagy in both HEK 293 cells and HeLa cells, whereas knockdown of p62 significantly decreased the basal level of autophagy. In vitro pulldown assay showed that p62 directly interacted with Bcl-2. It was observed in HeLa cells that p62 co-localized with Bcl-2. Furthermore, knockdown of p62 in HEK 293 cells significantly increased the amount of Beclin 1 that co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2.Conclusion:p62 induces autophagy by disrupting the association between Bcl-2 and Beclin 1. © 2013 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.

Methods: Radiosensitivity of Colo320 cells was detected by MTT assay and clone forming assay; the apoptosis rate of Colo320 cells was measured by TUNEL. Results: Compared with those in the simple radiation group, the OD value and the number of cell clones significantly decreased (P<0.05) while the apoptosis rate significantly increased (P<0.05) in β-elemene (20 μg/mL) combined with irradiation groups at the same radiation dose. Conclusion: β-elemene of low-cytotoxic concentration may enhance the radiosensitivity of Colo320 cells by inducing cell apoptosis.

84878820361	The ubiquitin proteasome system as a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases	Neurodegenerative diseases are severe disorders characterized by progressive neurodegeneration in specific brain regions. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is closely linked to neurodegenerative disease. In most cases, UPS impairment and dysregulation of the UPS components are frequently observed. Moreover, toxin-induced neurodegeneration produces neuronal cell death accompanied by decreased UPS function. These studies suggest an involvement of the UPS in these diseases. In this review, we summarize the changes to UPS components in neurodegenerative diseases and the association between the UPS and disease pathology. Dysfunction of the UPS results in the abnormal accumulation of proteins; thus, the UPS plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Drugs targeting specific components of the UPS may provide promising strategies for disease treatment. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84879458899	Prognostic correlation of intracranial pressure monitoring in patients with severe craniocerebral injury	Objective: To explore the clinical application of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and its prognostic correlation in patients with severe craniocerebral injury. Methods: A total of 216 severe craniocerebral injury patients with scores of Glasgow coma scale 3-8 underwent craniotomy at Affiliated Qilu Hospital, Shandong University. And 168 cases of ICP monitoring were divided into 3 treatment groups and another 48 cases without ICP monitoring selected as the control group. According to ICP, stepwise treatment was administered to control the level of ICP and maintain the cerebral perfusion pressure to analyze the relationship between ICP monitoring and prognosis. Results: As compared with the control group, there were significant decreases of disability and mortality rate for patients with ICP monitoring (A, B, C group). Especially group C had a better prognosis than the other groups for statistical significance. In addition, the dose and duration of mannitol of group A, B or C were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The application of ICP monitoring is capable of reducing mortality, improving prognosis and enhancing success rate of treating severe craniocerebral injury.

84882263814	Facile synthesis of pompon-like ZnO-Ag nanocomposites and their enhanced photocatalytic performance	A series of pompon-like ZnO-Ag nanocomposites were prepared by hydrothermal method and photochemical deposition technique. Several characterizations indicated the successful deposition of Ag nanoparticles on ZnO. As a whole, the as-prepared composites present pompon-like nanostructures with a diameter of ∼10 μm. In detail, the nanostructural, chemical and optical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), ultra-visible spectra (UV). The photocatalytic degradation experiments under UV irradiation using Methyl Orange (MO) as a model dye were executed here. The relative results demonstrated that the pompon-like ZnO-Ag nanocomposite with a suitable content of Ag nanoparticles (about 4.82 wt%) has the highest photochemical activity, and the removal ratio of MO was 99.1% after 0.5 h adsorption and subsequent 2 h photodegradation processes. The excellent photocatalytic performance was attributed to the high surface areas of ZnO nanostructure and effectively separation of photo-generated charge on flower-like ZnO by employing Ag nanoparticles as a conductor. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84882643371	Rotenone Directly Induces BV2 Cell Activation via the p38 MAPK Pathway	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Although its pathogenesis is still unclear, increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by environmental toxins, such as mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, plays a significant role in the disease process. The microglia in PD brains are highly activated, and inflammation is also an essential element in PD pathogenesis. However, the means by which these toxins activate microglia is still unclear. In the present study, we found that rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, could directly activate microglia via the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, thereby inducing significantly increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. We further observed that rotenone induced caspase-1 activation and mature IL-1β release, both of which are strictly dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The activation of p38 is associated with the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by rotenone. Removal of these ROS abrogated the activation of the microglia. Therefore, our data suggest that the environmental toxin rotenone can directly activate microglia through the p38 MAPK pathway. © 2013 Gao et al.

84884306536	Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion-induced autophagy protects against neuronal injury by mitochondrial clearance	Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) is a complex pathological process. Although autophagy can be evoked by ischemia, its involvement in the reperfusion phase after ischemia and its contribution to the fate of neurons remains largely unknown. In the present investigation, we found that autophagy was activated in the reperfusion phase, as revealed in both mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion and oxygen-glucose deprived cortical neurons in culture. Interestingly, in contrast to that in permanent ischemia, inhibition of autophagy (by 3-methyladenine, bafilomycin A1, Atg7 knockdown or in atg5-/- MEF cells) in the reperfusion phase reinforced, rather than reduced, the brain and cell injury induced by I-R. Inhibition of autophagy either with 3-methyladenine or Atg7 knockdown enhanced the I-R-induced release of cytochrome c and the downstream activation of apoptosis. Moreover, MitoTracker Red-labeled neuronal mitochondria increasingly overlapped with GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes during reperfusion, suggesting the presence of mitophagy. The mitochondrial clearance in I-R was reversed by 3-methyladenine and Atg7 silencing, further suggesting that mitophagy underlies the neuroprotection by autophagy. In support, administration of the mitophagy inhibitor mdivi-1 in the reperfusion phase aggravated the ischemia-induced neuronal injury both in vivo and in vitro. PARK2 translocated to mitochondria during reperfusion and Park2 knockdown aggravated ischemia-induced neuronal cell death. In conclusion, the results indicated that autophagy plays different roles in cerebral ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. The protective role of autophagy during reperfusion may be attributable to mitophagy-related mitochondrial clearance and inhibition of downstream apoptosis. PARK2 may be involved in the mitophagy process. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84883805969	Intrinsic apoptotic pathway and G2/M cell cycle arrest involved in tubeimoside I-induced EC109 cell death	Objective: Squamous esophageal carcinoma is highly prevalent in developing countries, especially in China. Tu Bei Mu (TBM), a traditional folk medicine, has been used to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) for a long term. tubeimoside I (TBMS1) is the main component of TBM, exhibiting great anticancer potential. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of TBMS1 cytotoxic effect on EC109 cells. Methods: Comparative nuclear proteomic approach was applied in the current study and we identified several altered protein spots. Further biochemical studies were carried out to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle and corresponding proteins' expression and location. Results: Subcellular proteomic study in the nucleus from EC109 cells revealed that altered proteins were associated with mitochondrial function and cell proliferation. Further biochemical studies showed that TBMS1-induced molecular events were related to mitochondria-induced intrinsic apoptosis and P21-cyclin B1/cdc2 complex-related G2/M cell cycle arrest. Conclusions: Considering the conventional application of TBM in esophageal cancer, TBMS1 therefore may have a great potential as a chemotherapeutic drug candidate for ESCC. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

84884597033	Haemoptysis as a prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma after curative resection	Background:Haemoptysis is a common symptom of lung cancer. Its prognostic role and mechanisms are still poorly understood.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 666 consecutive patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma who underwent complete resection. The prognostic value of haemoptysis with respect to overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was analysed. To further explore the possible mechanisms of haemoptysis, we evaluated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, tumour necrosis, vascular invasion and extratumoural microvessel density (MVD) in 112 randomly selected patients.Results:Haemoptysis predicted poor OS, DSS and DFS in operable lung adenocarcinoma (all P<0.001). In addition, haemoptysis was associated with high white blood cell (WBC) count (P=0.032), high fibrinogen (Fib; P<0.001), high tumour greatest dimension (P<0.001), severe vascular invasion (P=0.002) and central tumour location (P<0.001). We obtained no statistically significant differences of VEGF expression, tumour necrosis and extratumoural MVD in haemoptysis and non-haemoptysis groups.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates that haemoptysis predicts poor OS, DSS and DFS in lung adenocarcinoma after curative resection. Vascular invasion rather than angiogenesis or tumour necrosis could be the most important mechanism of haemoptysis in lung adenocarcinoma. © 2013 Cancer Research UK.

The effects of the cardiac glycosides on apoptosis and the expression of orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 were examined in human NIH-H460 lung cancer cells. Several of the cardiac glycosides induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells, which was accompanied by induction of Nur77 protein expression. Treatment of cancer cells with the cardiac glycosides resulted in translocation of the Nur77 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequent targeting to mitochondria. The results show that the cardiac glycosides exert their apoptotic effect through the Nur77-dependent apoptotic pathway. © 2013 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.

84891602619	Identification of CHIP as a novel causative gene for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia	Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by complex clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Although more than 20 disease-causing genes have been identified, many patients are still currently without a molecular diagnosis. In a two-generation autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia family, we mapped a linkage to a minimal candidate region on chromosome 16p13.3 flanked by single-nucleotide polymorphism markers rs11248850 and rs1218762. By combining the defined linkage region with the whole-exome sequencing results, we identified a homozygous mutation (c.493CT) in CHIP (NM-005861) in this family. Using Sanger sequencing, we also identified two compound heterozygous mutations (c.389AT/c.441GT; c.621C>G/c.707GC) in CHIP gene in two additional kindreds. These mutations co-segregated exactly with the disease in these families and were not observed in 500 control subjects with matched ancestry. CHIP colocalized with NR2A, a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, in the cerebellum, pons, medulla oblongata, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Wild-type, but not disease-associated mutant CHIPs promoted the degradation of NR2A, which may underlie the pathogenesis of ataxia. In conclusion, using a combination of whole-exome sequencing and linkage analysis, we identified CHIP, encoding a U-box containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, as a novel causative gene for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. © 2013 Shi et al.

However, the role and the underlying mechanism of miR-29a in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unknown.Methods:MiR-29a targeted gene was identified by the luciferase assay and western blot. MiR-29a function was analysed by invasion assays and the orthotopic transplantation mouse model. The miR-29a pathway was assayed by real-time PCR, western blot and chip analysis.Results:KLF4 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-29a. MiR-29a promoted CRC cell invasion, which was blocked by re-expression of KLF4. In addition, MMP2 was identified as a novel direct target of KLF4. Both miR-29a overexpression and KLF4 knockdown promoted MMP2 expression but inhibited E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, clinical data indicated that both miR-29a high expression and KLF4 mRNA low expression were associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in CRC patients, and KLF4 protein expression was inversely correlated with MMP2 but positively correlated with E-cad protein expression.Conclusion:Increased expression of miR-29a promoted CRC metastasis by regulating MMP2/E-cad through direct targeting KLF4, which highlights the potential of the miR-29a inhibitor as a novel agent against CRC metastasis. © 2014 Cancer Research UK.

The primary objective of our meta-analysis was to determine the impact of tumour-infiltrating inflammation on survival outcomes. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to identify studies reporting the prognostic significance of tumour-infiltrating inflammation for patients with CRC. The primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: A total of 30 studies involving 2988 patients were identified.

Here we show that H3R expression is upregulated after I/R in two mouse models. H3R antagonists and H3R knockout attenuate I/R injury, which is reversed by an H3R-selective agonist. Interestingly, H1R and H2R antagonists, a histidine decarboxylase (HDC) inhibitor and HDC knockout all fail to compromise the protection by H3R blockade. H3R blockade inhibits mTOR phosphorylation and reinforces autophagy. The neuroprotection by H3R antagonism is reversed by 3-methyladenine and siRNA for Atg7, and is diminished in Atg5

84898603942	Survival benefits of metformin for colorectal cancer patients with diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: Several studies suggest that metformin has the potential effect of reducing cancer risk. However, its survival benefit in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and diabetes is unknown. The aim of our study is to address the effect of metformin on outcomes for CRC based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods and Findings: We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from inception through August, 2013, using search terms related to metformin, diabetes, colorectal cancer, and prognostic outcome. The outcome measures were hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs comparing CRC survival in diabetic patients using metformin and without using metformin. The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and CRC specific survival (CS). A total of six cohort studies including 2,461 patients met full eligibility criteria. The pooled HR favoring metformin users was 0.56 for OS (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.77) and 0.66 for CRCspecific survival (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.87). Thus metformin therapy reduced the risk of all cause of death by 44% and the risk of CRC specific death by 34% in CRC patients compared to those in non-users. However, evidence of heterogeneity and possible publication bias was noted for OS. Conclusions: Patients with CRC and diabetes treated with metformin appear to have an improved survival outcome. Prospective study should be warranted to examine the association between metformin exposure intensity as well as some other confounding variables and survival outcome in diabetic CRC patients. © 2014 Mei et al.

We explored NF-κB activation and the relationship between NF-κB and cell death in the perihematomal brain tissue of patients after ICH. According to the interval between onset of hemorrhage and specimen collection, 53 cases of patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage were divided into six experimental groups: 0-6, 7-12, 13-24, 25-48, 49-96, and >96 h group. Brain tissues of the experimental groups and control group were collected. IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-κB p65 expressions at the protein level were detected by immunohistochemistry. Cell death was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. All of the detection items of immunohistochemistry and TUNEL showed significant differences between the experimental groups and control group. At the protein level, nuclear NF-κB p65, IL-1β, and TNF-α achieved maximum values at 13-48, 0-24, and 13-48 h, respectively. Maximum cell death was reached at 13-48 h. NF-κB activation increased dramatically in perihematomal brain tissue after ICH.

84906842013	P62/sequestosome 1 regulates aggresome formation of pathogenic ataxin-3 with expanded polyglutamine	The cellular protein quality control system in association with aggresome formation contributes to protecting cells against aggregation-prone protein-induced toxicity. p62/Sequestosome 1 (p62) is a multifunctional protein which plays an important role in protein degradation and aggregation. Although poly-ubiquitination is usually required for p62-mediated protein degradation and aggresome formation, several p62 substrates are processed to form aggregate in an ubiquitination-independent manner. In this study we demonstrate that p62 directly interacts with pathogenic Machado Joseph Disease (MJD)-associated protein ataxin-3 with polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion. Moreover, p62 could regulate the aggresome formation of pathogenic ataxin-3 and protect cells against pathogenic ataxin-3-induced cell death. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84906851501	The protease Omi regulates mitochondrial biogenesis through the GSK3β/PGC-1α pathway	Loss of the mitochondrial protease activity of Omi causes mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration with parkinsonian features and premature death in mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) mice. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this pathology remain largely unknown. Here, we report that Omi participates in the process of mitochondrial biogenesis, which has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. The mitochondrial biogenesis is deficit in mnd2 mice, evidenced by severe decreases of mitochondrial components, mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial density. Omi cleaves glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a kinase promoting PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) degradation, to regulate PGC-1α, a factor important for the mitochondrial biogenesis. In mnd2 mice, GSK3β abundance is increased and PGC-1α abundance is decreased significantly. Inhibition of GSK3β by SB216763 or overexpression of PGC-1α can restore mitochondrial biogenesis in mnd2 mice or Omi-knockdown N2a cells. Furthermore, there is a significant improvement of the movement ability of mnd2 mice after SB216763 treatment. Thus, our study identified Omi as a novel regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, involving in Omi protease-deficient-induced neurodegeneration. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84922659516	Compact microfluidic sensing by introducing effective phase shift in fiber Bragg grating	A compact microfluidic refractive index sensor fabricated by drilling hole in the middle section of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is reported herein. The laser-drilled hole provides a microfluidic channel for the aqueous sample to pass through while at the same time permits coupling of the interrogating light to detect the target analyte. The reported sensor takes advantage of the fact that a small phase shift in the central region of the grating will result in a very sharp peak in the FBG stop-band. The phase shift can be related to a range of possible perturbations inside the microfluidic channel, including passage of cells, beads and a shift in the concentration of certain fluidic component. The amount of wavelength shift of the peak in the FBG stop-band represents the change in the refractive index inside the microfluidic channel. Simulation results indicate very favorable sensor signal characteristics such as large wavelength shift and sharp reflection dips. The reported microfluidic phase shift FGB sensor could be a good candidate for portable flow cytometry applications.

84924286816	Naja naja atra venom ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting inflammatory response and oxidative stress	Background: Naja naja atra venom (NNAV) displays diverse pharmacological actions including analgesia, anti-inflammation and immune regulation. Methods: To determine if Naja naja atra venom (NNAV) can produce beneficial effects on pulmonary fibrosis, two marine models of pulmonary fibrosis were produced with bleomycin (BLM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NNAV (30, 90, 270 μg/kg) was orally administered once a day started five days before BLM and LPS until to the end of experiment. The effects of NNAV treatment on pulmonary injury were evaluated with arterial blood gas analysis, hydroxyproline (HYP) content assessment and HE/Masson staining. The effects of NNAV treatment on inflammatory related cytokines, fibrosis related TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and oxidative stress were examined. Results: The results showed that NNAV improved the lung gas-exchange function and attenuated the fibrotic lesions in lung. NNAV decreased IL-1β and TNF-α levels in serum in both pulmonary fibrosis models. NNAV inhibited the activation of NF-κB in LPS-induced and TGF-β/Smad pathway in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, NNAV also increased the levels of SOD and GSH and reduced the levels of MDA in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. Conclusions: The present study indicates that NNAV attenuates LPS- and BLM-induced lung fibrosis. Its mechanisms of action are associated with inhibiting inflammatory response and oxidative stress. The study suggests that NNAV might be a potential therapeutic drug for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.
