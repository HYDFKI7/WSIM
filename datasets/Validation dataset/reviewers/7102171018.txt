13944252881	Cytochrome P450 1B1 and catechol-O-methyltransferase genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in Chinese women: Results from the Shanghai breast cancer study and a meta-analysis	Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) are important estrogen-metabolizing enzymes and, thus, genetic polymorphisms of these enzymes may affect breast cancer risk. A population-based case-control study was conducted to assess the association of breast cancer risk with CYP1B1 and COMT polymorphisms. A meta-analysis was done to summarize the findings from this and previous studies. Included in this study were 1,135 incident breast cancer cases diagnosed from August 1996 through March 1998 among female residents of Shanghai and 1,235 randomly selected, age frequency-matched controls from the same general population. The common alleles of the CYP1B1 gene were Arg (79.97%) in codon 48, Ala (80.53%) in codon 119, and Leu (86.57%) in codon 432. The Val allele accounted for 72.46% of the total alleles identified in codon 108/158 of the COMT gene. No overall associations of breast cancer risk were found with any of the single nucleotide polymorphisms described above. This finding was supported by a meta-analysis of all previous published studies. No gene-gene interactions were observed between CYP1B1 and COMT genotypes. The associations of breast cancer risk with factors related to endogenous estrogen exposure, such as years of menstruation and body mass index, were not significantly modified by the CYP1B1 and COMT genotypes. We observed, however, that women who carried one copy of the variant allele in CYP1B1 codons 48 or 119 were less likely to have estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer than those who carried two copies of the corresponding wild-type alleles. The results from this study were consistent with those from most previous studies, indicating no major associations of breast cancer risk with CYP1B1 and COMT polymorphisms.

20444433587	Association of genetic polymorphisms in the VEGF gene with breast cancer survival	The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important regulator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability. VEGF overexpression has been associated with advanced stage and poor survival of several cancers. We evaluated the association of functional polymorphisms in the VEGF gene with breast cancer survival in a cohort of 1,193 breast cancer patients who were recruited as part of a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China from 1996 to 1998 and followed for cancer recurrence and mortality between March 2000 and December 2002. Included in the study were three functional polymorphisms (C-460T, G+405C, and C+936T) in the VEGF gene. Carrying the -460C or +405G allele was associated with decreased overall survival. The age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were 1.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.9-2.5] for -460CC genotype carriers and 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0-2.5) for +405GG genotype carriers compared with noncarriers. Further analyses showed that the -460T/+450C/+936C haplotype was related to increased survival (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9), whereas the -460C/+405G/+936T haplotype was associated with nonsignificantly decreased survival (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, -0.9 to 4.7). The C+936T polymorphism alone was not related to overall or disease-free survival. This study suggests that VEGF polymorphisms may be a significant genetic marker for breast cancer prognosis. © 2005 American Association for Cancer Research.

2942517664	Population-based case-control study of CYP11A gene polymorphism and breast cancer risk	The CYP11A gene encodes the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of sex hormones. A pentanucleotide repeat [(TAAAA)n] polymorphism in the 5′ of the CYP11A gene has been reported to be related to the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome, an inherited endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenemia. We investigated the association of this polymorphism with breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study conducted among Chinese women in Shanghai. Genotype assays were completed for 1015 incident breast cancer cases and 1082 community controls. Three common alleles with 4, 6, or 8 TAAAA repeats were identified in the study population. The frequency of the 8 repeat allele was more common in cases (12.6%) than controls (8.5%) (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-1.9; P < 0.0001). Compared to subjects who did not carry this allele, adjusted odds ratios were 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-1.9) and 2.9 (1.3-6.7) (P for trend, <0.001), respectively, for those who carried one and two copies of this allele. This positive association was observed in both pre- and postmenopausal women and all strata defined by major breast cancer risk factors, including years of menstruation, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio. The results from this study indicate that the TAAAA repeat polymorphism near the promoter region of the CYP11A gene may be an important susceptibility factor for breast cancer risk.

28544443646	The Shanghai women's health study: Rationale, study design, and baseline characteristics	Although cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in most nations, the spectrum of cancer occurrence varies substantially worldwide. Most previous epidemiologic studies investigating cancer etiology were conducted in North American and western European countries that are relatively homogenous in terms of cancer spectrums and many lifestyle exposures. These limitations may have hindered these studies from evaluating some important etiologic hypotheses. From 1996 to 2000, the Shanghai Women's Health Study recruited 74,942 adult Chinese women from selected urban communities, with a 92% response rate. All participants completed a detailed baseline survey and anthropometrics. Approximately 88% of cohort members donated a urine sample (n = 65,755) and a blood (n = 56,832) or exfoliated buccal cell (n = 8,934) sample. Noteworthy characteristics of this cohort include low consumption of alcohol (1.9%) and use of tobacco (2.4%); high intake of fish (mean, 50.8 g/day), soy foods (mean, 142.3 g/day), and certain vegetables; low prevalence of obesity (5.1%); and nearly 100% employment outside the home. Currently, this cohort of women is being followed via biennial in-person recontact and periodic linkage to cancer and vital statistics registries. The resources from the cohort will be valuable in future studies of environmental exposures and biomarkers for the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases.

3042785734	Genetic polymorphisms in the human growth hormone-1 gene (GH1) and the risk of breast carcinoma	BACKGROUND. In addition to possessing many physiologic functions, human growth hormone-1 (GH1) has been shown in recent in vitro and in vivo experiments to induce malignant disease, including breast carcinoma. The authors investigated the association of breast carcinoma with genetic polymorphisms in the GH1 gene in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. METHODS. Included in the current investigation were 1193 women with breast carcinoma (case patients) and 1310 healthy women from the same community (control patients) who completed in-person interviews and provided blood samples. Genetic polymorphisms in the proximal promoter region (nucleotide [nt] -162 to nt +148 relative to the transcription start site of the GH1 gene) were searched and confirmed by resequencing DNA samples from 43 study participants. A novel polymorphism, a transition from adenine to guanine at nt 69 (A69G), was identified. Samples from all participants were genotyped with TaqMan 5′ nuclease assays for five common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-four in the proximal region (A-75G, G-57T, A-6G, and A69G) and one in intron 4 (T1169A). RESULTS. The frequencies of occurrence for the minor alleles in these polymorphic sites were 0.04, 0.60, 0.24, 0.03, and 0.34, respectively, in the control group; these frequencies were comparable to those observed in the case group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, none of the SNPs investigated in this study showed a statistically significant association with breast carcinoma risk. This null association was found for both younger women (age < 45 years) and older women (age ≥ 45 years). GH1 gene haplotypes were assessed using SNP data and were analyzed in relation to breast carcinoma risk. Again, none of the haplotypes were associated with breast carcinoma risk. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the proximal promoter region and in the fourth intron of the GH1 gene are unrelated to breast carcinoma risk in Chinese women. © 2004 American Cancer Society.

3042532630	Use of complementary and alternative medicine by Chinese women with breast cancer	The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been rapidly increasing among cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of CAM use, particularly patients' intentions and their perceived effectiveness of using Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), as well as the relations between the herbal medicine use and demographic and clinical factors among Chinese women with breast cancer. We analyzed the data from a population-based sample of 1065 breast cancer women in urban Shanghai. Patients' average age at diagnosis was 48.1 years and the median time from the initial diagnosis to the follow-up survey was 4.3 years. Overall, 98% of patients had used at least one form of CAM therapy after diagnosis of breast cancer. The most popular CAM modality was traditional Chinese medicine (86.7%), followed by the use of supplements (84.8%), physical exercises (65.5%), and support group attendance (16.6%). CHM was used by 86.4% of patients, while acupuncture was used only by 4.9% of patients. Treating cancer (81.5%) was the most common intentions of using CHM. Other cited intentions included enhancing the immune system (12%), preventing metastasis of cancer or managing other discomforts (7.9%), and lessening menopausal symptoms (4.7%). The majority of patients reported that they had benefited from the use of CHM. Patients who were younger, married, had higher education or income, received chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or had recurrence/metastasis of cancer tended to use CHM more frequently than other patients. The relations between patient characteristics and use of CHMs varied with users' intentions. Given the high prevalence of CAM use among breast cancer patients, research is urgently needed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAM use, particularly use of herbal medicines.

33745683838	Population-based case-control study of VEGF gene polymorphisms and breast cancer risk among Chinese women	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major angiogenic factor involved in a number of pathologic processes, including neovascularization, a crucial step in the development of solid malignancies. Using data and specimens collected in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study conducted in urban Shanghai, China from 1996 to 1998, we evaluated the association of VEGF gene polymorphisms with breast cancer risk. Included in this study were 1,093 cases and 1,184 age-matched controls who had completed an in-person interview and donated a blood sample to the study. Polymorphisms in the promoter region (T-460C), 5′ untranslated region (C+405G), and 3′untranslated region (C936T) were genotyped using the Taqman allelic discrimination assay. No statistically significant case-control difference was found for the C+405G and T-460C polymorphisms. However, the C936T polymorphism was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Compared with CC genotype carriers, women who had the TT genotype showed a decreased risk [odds ratio (OR), 0.65; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.41-1.02], and the inverse association was restricted to premenopausal women (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.79). Six common haplotypes were identified. Compared with the most common haplotype (-460T/405C/936C), the -460T/405G/936T haplotype was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43-1.04), particularly in premenopausal women (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.81). Our study suggests that the VEGF C936T polymorphism might be a susceptibility factor for breast cancer among Chinese women. Copyright © 2006 American Association for Cancer Research.

33747616254	Environmental tobacco smoke and mortality in Chinese women who have never smoked: Prospective cohort study	Objective: To evaluate the association of environmental exposure to tobacco smoke from husbands and from work, as well as from family members in early life, with all cause mortality and mortality due to cancer or cardiovascular disease in Chinese women. Design: Ongoing prospective cohort study in Shanghai, China. Participants: Of 72 829 women who had never smoked, 65 180 women provided information on smoking by their husbands, and 66 520 women provided information on exposure to tobacco smoke at work and in early life from family members. Main outcome measures: All cause mortality and cause specific mortality with the main focus on cancer and cardiovascular disease. Cumulative mortality according to exposure status, and hazard ratios. Results: Exposure to tobacco smoke from husbands (mainly current exposure) was significantly associated with increased all cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.31) and with increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease (1.37, 1.06 to 1.78). Exposure to tobacco smoke at work was associated with increased mortality due to cancer (1.19, 0.94 to 1.50), especially lung cancer (1.79, 1.09 to 2.93). Exposure in early life was associated with increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease (1.26, 0.94 to 1.69). Conclusions: In Chinese women, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is related to moderately increased risk of all cause mortality and mortality due to lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.

33845330613	Genetic polymorphisms of the CYP19A1 gene and breast cancer survival	The CYP19A1 protein (aromatase) plays a critical role in estrogen biosynthesis and thus may be related to the progression of breast cancer. We examined the association between CYP19A1 genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer survival in a cohort of 1,136 patients who were recruited as part of a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China from 1996 to 1998 and who has donated a DNA sample to the study. Patients were followed for cancer recurrence and mortality through July 2005. Nineteen haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CYP19A1 gene were evaluated. For each of the five SNPs located in haplotype block 2, patients homozygous for the minor alleles had a reduced 5-year disease-free survival rate compared with those carrying the major allele. The age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 1.5 (1.1-2.1), 2.1 (1.2-3.6), 1.5 (1.1-2.0), 1.4 (1.0-2.0), and 1.4 (1.0-2.0) for hCV1664178, rs12900137, rs730154, rs936306, and rs1902586, respectively. Haplotype analyses showed that the haplotype CCCTA (all minor alleles of the five SNPs in block 2) was associated with decreased disease-free survival (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3). The nonsynonymous SNP, rs700519 (Arg264Cys), located in haplotype block 4, was also associated with breast cancer survival. The age-adjusted HR for the Cys/Cys (T/T) genotype was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-4.1) for overall survival and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9) for disease-free survival, compared with those carrying the Arg (C) allele. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 gene may have effects on breast cancer prognosis. Copyright © 2006 American Association for Cancer Research.

33847269217	CYP19A1 genetic polymorphisms may be associated with obesity-related phenotypes in Chinese women	Object: To examine the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of the CYP19A1 gene and obesity-related phenotypes, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Subjects: In total, 1241 Chinese women, who were recruited as community controls for a population-based case-control study of breast cancer. Methods: Nineteen haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in four haplotype blocks were genotyped. Results: Significant associations were observed for WHR at three SNPs that are located in haplotype block 1, including rs2445765, rs1004984 and rs1902584 (P=0.05, 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). Women, particularly premenopausal women, who carried the minor allele at any of these SNPs, had higher WHR than those without it. Of these three SNPs, the strongest association was observed at rs1902584, which is the closest to Promoter I.4, the major promoter for adipose tissue. Haplotype analyses indicated an association between the haplotype TCCAT in block 1 and WHR with a P-value of 0.02. Conclusion: These results suggested that CYP19A1 genetic polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of obesity among Chinese women, especially among premenopausal women.The CYP19A1 protein (aromatase) plays a critical role in estrogen biosynthesis and thus affects body fat distribution and regulation. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

34247115874	Assessment of dietary isoflavone intake among middle-aged Chinese men	We evaluated the reproducibility and validity of the FFQ used in the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS) for assessing dietary isoflavone intake, using multiple 24-h dietary recalls (24-HDR) and urinary isoflavones as the reference criteria, with data from the dietary validation study of the SMHS. A total of 196 study subjects completed the 24-HDR and 2 FFQ and donated a quarterly spot urine sample during the 1-y study period. Levels of urinary isoflavones were measured in a random sample of 48 study participants. The correlation coefficient between the 2 FFQ administered 1 y apart was 0.50 for soy protein intake and ranged from 0.50 to 0.51 for isoflavone intake. The correlations of isoflavone intake from the second FFQ with those from the multiple 24-HDR ranged from 0.38 (genistein) to 0.44 (glycitein), and the correlations with urinary isoflavone levels were 0.48 for total isoflavones, 0.44 for daidzein, 0.42 for genistein, and 0.54 for glycitein. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the 4 spot urine samples were 0.36, 0.42, and 0.40 for daidzein, genistein, and glycitein, respectively, and 0.62, 0.68, and 0.55 for their metabolic products equol, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin, respectively. These results suggest that the SMHS FFQ can reliably and accurately measure usual intake of isoflavones, and that the levels of isoflavones in urine samples are relatively stable among men in Shanghai. © 2007 American Society for Nutrition.

34250305827	Expression of cytochrome P450 1B1 and catechol-O-methyltransferase in breast tissue and their associations with breast cancer risk	Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) are important estrogen-metabolizing enzymes that may affect breast cancer risk. Few studies have directly measured the expression of CYP1B1 and COMT genes in breast tissue samples. The subjects in this study were a subgroup of participants of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study including 64 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and 68 patients diagnosed with benign breast diseases (BBD) who provided samples of tumor tissue and adjacent nontumor tissue to the study. We compared CYP1B1 and COMT mRNA expression in tumor tissue and adjacent nontumor tissue in both breast cancer patients and BBD patients. High levels of CYP1B1 expression and low levels of COMT expression in adjacent nontumor tissue were associated with a significantly increased breast cancer risk in a nonlinear manner. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (in parentheses) for the midpoints of the first, second, fourth, and fifth quintiles of gene expression levels compared with the overall median levels in BBD subjects were 0.21 (0.07-0.67), 0.81 (0.69-0.95), 1.20 (1.05-1.38), and 1.55 (1.12-2.15) for CYP1B1 and 1.72 (1.17-2.55), 1.19 (1.05-1.35), 0.83 (0.73-0.95), and 0.78 (0.65-0.93) for COMT, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that the formation and accumulation of catechol estrogens in breast tissue through increased CYP1B1 expression and reduced COMT expression may play a significant role in breast cancer risk.

34250315219	Polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 (aromatase) gene and endometrial cancer risk in Chinese women	Aromatase, encoded by the CYP19A1 gene, is a key enzyme in estradiol biosynthesis, which catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol, respectively. Given the critical role of estrogen in the development of endometrial cancer risk, we evaluated genetic polymorphisms of the CYP19A1 gene, including rs1065779, rs700519, rs28566535, rs752760, and rs1870050, in association with endometrial cancer in a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China. Genotypes of 1,040 incident endometrial cancer cases and 1,031 frequency-matched controls were included in the study. We applied a logistic regression model to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Six common haplotypes with a frequency ≥5% were estimated; the highest frequency haplotype was GCACA (27.8% in cases and 26.2% in controls). We observed an inverse association between CYP19A1 haplotype TCATC and endometrial cancer in our population (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92). An inverse association was found between endometrial cancer and single nucleotide polymorphism rs1870050 in the promoter region with ORs of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.68-0.97) and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.42-0.80) for the AC and CC genotypes, respectively. We observed a multiplicative interaction between single nucleotide polymorphism rs700519 and body mass index among postmenopausal women (P = 0.01), with stronger associations between rs700519 genotypes and endometrial cancer risk among heavier (body mass index, ≥25) postmenopausal women. In summary, our data show that polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 gene may contribute to endometrial carcinogenesis. Copyright © 2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

34547795168	Genetic variation in IGF1, IGF-1R, IGFALS, and IGFBP3 in breast cancer survival among Chinese women: A report from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study	Disruption of the balance of IGF (Insulin like growth factor) pathway constituents has been implicated in the etiology and progression of breast and other cancers. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in IGF system members may be associated with breast cancer survival and evaluated this hypothesis in a cohort of 1,455 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 1998 in Shanghai, China. Nineteen functional or potentially functional polymorphisms were evaluated in the IGF-1, IGF-1R, IGFALS, and IGFBP3 genes. Disease recurrence and vital status were obtained with a median follow-up time of 7.1 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall, no significant association was noted between any of the 19 polymorphisms and survival. However, subgroup analyses demonstrated apparent interactions between menopausal status and survival for several (Single nucleotide polymorphism) SNPs in the IGF-1R and IGFBP3 genes. Carriers of the A/G or G/G genotypes (rs951715) in the IGF-1R gene had an increased risk of death among post-menopausal women (HR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7). Significant associations with breast cancer survival in pre-menopausal women were found for two IGFBP3 polymorphisms (rs2854744 and rs3110697), with an additional polymorphism (rs6413441) reaching borderline significance (P = 0.05). Hazard ratios for overall survival among pre-menopausal women were 1.5 (95% CI = 1.1-2.0) for the C/T-T/T genotypes (rs3110697), 1.4 (95% CI = 1.0-1.9) for the A/C-C/C genotypes (rs2854744), and 1.4 (95% CI = 1.0-1.9) for the N/A-A/A genotypes (rs6413441). Taken together, these data suggest that polymorphisms in the IGF-1R and IGFBP3 genes may be associated with altered survival among subgroups of breast cancer patients defined by menopausal status. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

35348890213	Patterns and correlates of physical activity: A cross-sectional study in urban Chinese women	Background. Inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for many diseases. Rapid economic development in China has been associated with changes in lifestyle, including physical activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the patterns and correlates of physical activity in middle-aged and elderly women from urban Shanghai. Methods. Study population consisted of 74,942 Chinese women, 40-70 years of age, participating in the baseline survey of the Shanghai Women's Health Study (1997-2000), an ongoing population-based cohort study. A validated, interviewer-administered physical activity questionnaire was used to collect information about several physical activity domains (exercise/sports, walking and cycling for transportation, housework). Correlations between physical activity domains were evaluated by Spearman rank-correlation coefficients. Associations between physical activity and socio-demographic and lifestyle factors were evaluated by odds ratios derived from logistic regression. Results. While more than a third of study participants engaged in regular exercise, this form of activity contributed only about 10% to daily non-occupational energy expenditure. About two-thirds of women met current recommendations for lifestyle activity. Age was positively associated with participation in exercise/sports and housework. Dietary energy intake was positively associated with all physical activity domains. High socioeconomic status, unemployment (including retirement), history of chronic disease, small household, non-smoking status, alcohol and tea consumption, and ginseng intake were all positively associated with exercise participation. High socioeconomic status and small household were inversely associated with non-exercise activities. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that physical activity domains other than sports and exercise are important contributors to total energy expenditure in women. Correlates of physical activity are domain-specific. These findings provide important information for research on the health benefits of physical activity and have public health implications for designing interventions to promote participation in physical activity. © 2007 Jurj et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0033066416	Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids and the risk of breast cancer	Isoflavonoids are a group of biologically active phytochemicals that humans are exposed to mainly through soy food intake. Because of the similar chemical structure of these compounds and estradiol, it has been hypothesized that isoflavonoids may be related to the risk of breast cancer. Overnight urine samples from 60 incident breast cancer cases and their individually matched controls were assayed for urinary excretion rates of five major isoflavonoids (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, equol, and O- desmethylangolensin) and total phenols. These subjects were from a large population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai, and urine samples from breast cancer cases were collected before any cancer therapy to minimize the potential influence of the disease and its sequelae on study results. Urinary excretion of total phenols and all individual isoflavonoids, particularly glycitein, was substantially lower in breast cancer cases than controls. For total isoflavonoids, the mean excretion was 13.95 nmol/mg creatinine (SD, 20.76 nmol/mg creatinine) for cases and 19.52 nmol/mg creatinine (SD, 25.36 nmol/mg creatinine) for controls (P for difference = 0.04). The case-control difference was more evident when median levels of these compounds were compared, with the median excretion of all major isoflavonoids being 50-65% lower in cases than in controls. Individuals in the highest tertile of daidzein, glycitein, and total isoflavonoids had about half the cancer risk of those in the lowest tertile. The adjusted odds ratio for breast cancer was 0.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.88) for women whose urinary excretion of both phenol and total isoflavonoids was in the upper 50% compared with those in the lower 50%. The results from this study support the hypothesis that a high intake of soy foods may reduce the risk of breast cancer.

38849090548	Intra-individual variation of plasma adipokine levels and utility of single measurement of these biomarkers in population-based studies	Adipokines, soluble mediators produced by adipocytes, may link adipose tissue to the inflammatory, metabolic, and immune dysregulation that characterize many obesity-related diseases. The stability of plasma adipokine levels within individuals, their seasonal variability, intercorrelations, and relationships to well-established measures of adiposity are incompletely defined. We measured levels of 12 adipokines [interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), nerve growth factor (NGF), leptin, adiponectin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and resistin] in four seasonal random plasma samples of 48 male participants of a population-based cohort study. The representativeness of single measurements was assessed by correlating the adipokine levels of a single, random sample with the mean levels from the remaining three samples using a bootstrap approach and using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Spearman correlations between adipokine levels, age, body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were estimated. Correlations between plasma adipokine levels from one random sample and the mean of the remaining three seasonal samples ranged from 0.57 to 0.89. Over the 1-year study period, the ICCs for adipokine levels ranged from 0.44 (PAI-1) to 0.83 (HGF). IL-8, MCP-1, and resistin levels were positively associated with age; HGF and PAI-1 levels were correlated with BMI and WHR. This study suggests that adipokine levels in a single blood sample may be useful biomarkers of inflammation in population-based studies of obesity-related disease.

38349085901	Stability and reliability of plasma level of lipid biomarkers and their correlation with dietary fat intake	The reliability and stability of plasma lipid biomarkers and their association with dietary fat intake were evaluated among 48 subjects who were randomly chosen from the participants of a validation study of the population-based cohort, the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS). Four spot blood samples, one taken each season, were measured for total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol levels. The reliability and stability of these measurements were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and by the correlations between a randomly chosen measurement with the mean of measurements across seasons using a bootstrap approach. The median levels for total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol were 177.5, 164.5, 41.0, and 102.5 (mg/dl), respectively. The ICCs of the biomarkers ranged from 0.58 (LDL-cholesterol) to 0.83 (HDL-cholesterol). The correlation between randomly chosen spot measurements and the mean measurement were 0.91, 0.86, 0.93, and 0.83 for total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, respectively. The correlations of lipid biomarkers with dietary fat intake and other lifestyle factors were comparable to other previous reports. In conclusion, this study suggests that measurements of lipid biomarkers from a single spot blood sample are a good representation of the average blood levels of these biomarkers in the study population and could be a useful tool for epidemiological studies. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

38849180907	Haplotype analyses of CYP19A1 gene variants and breast cancer risk: Results from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study	Estrogens play a central role in the etiology of breast cancer. The CYP19A1 gene encodes aromatase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of estrogens. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) or haplotypes in the CYP19A1 gene have been evaluated in relation to breast cancer risk. However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, we constructed haplotypes of the CYP19A1 gene using 19 haplotype-tagging SNPs in Chinese women and evaluated the variation of this gene in relation to breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study involving 1,140 cases and 1,244 community controls of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. Five common haplotypes in block 1, three common haplotypes in block 2, five common haplotypes in block 3, and four common haplotypes in block 4 were identified. No apparent association was observed between common haplotypes and breast cancer risk in analyses including all subjects nor in analyses stratified by menopausal status. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls in the genotype distributions of the 19 individual SNPs and the (TTTA)

33644955956	Spousal correlations for lifestyle factors and selected diseases in Chinese couples	PURPOSE: Spouses usually are genetically unrelated and share a common living environment. Thus, concordance of diseases in spouses reflects mainly environmental etiologic contributors. The purpose of this study is to investigate spousal associations for selected lifestyle characteristics and common medical conditions. METHODS: Baseline information from 66,130 married couples participating in the Shanghai Women's Health Study was used in this analysis. Husband-wife associations were evaluated by means of logistic regression, using women's lifestyle and medical conditions as dependent variables. Adjustments were made for women's age, education, occupation, and family income in all models. RESULTS: Women were more than twice as likely to be current or former smokers; be regular consumers of alcohol, tea, and ginseng; and exercise regularly if their husbands had the same habit. A statistically significant husband-wife disease association was found for tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic gastritis, chronic hepatitis, ulcerative colitis, cholelithiasis, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Spouses share common lifestyle habits and health risks. This study supports the hypothesis that the shared marital environment may contribute to similarities in lifestyle and morbidity in spouses and provides a basis for health promotion and prevention strategies that target the spouses of patients. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

58149379942	Dietary carbohydrates, fiber, and breast cancer risk in Chinese women	Background: Few studies have investigated the association of dietary carbohydrate and fiber intake with breast cancer risk in women in China, where carbohydrate intake is traditionally high. Objective: The objective was to prospectively evaluate the association of dietary carbohydrates, glycemic index, glycemic load, and dietary fiber with breast cancer risk and to determine whether the effect of these dietary intakes is modified by age and selected insulin- or estrogen-related risk factors. Design: A total of 74,942 women aged 40-70 y were recruited into the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a population-based cohort study. Dietary intake was assessed by in-person interviews. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate associations. Results: During an average of 7.35 y of follow-up, 616 incident breast cancer cases were documented. A higher carbohydrate intake was associated with a higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer (P for trend = 0.002). Compared with the lowest quintile, the hazard ratios (and 95% CIs) were 1.47 (1.00, 2.32) and 2.01 (1.26, 3.19) for the fourth and fifth quintiles, respectively. A similar pattern was found for glycemic load. The association between carbohydrate intake and breast cancer was significantly modified by age; the increased breast cancer risk associated with carbohydrate intake was restricted to women who were younger than 50 y. No significant association of breast cancer risk with glycemic index or dietary fiber intake was found. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a high carbohydrate intake and a diet with a high glycemic load may be associated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women or women <50 y. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.

0034662320	Association of menstrual and reproductive factors with breast cancer risk: Results from the Shanghai breast cancer study	The incidence of breast cancer among women in Shanghai, a traditionally low-risk population, has increased substantially over the past 20 years. To evaluate the association of menstrual and reproductive factors with breast cancer risk and the influence of these factors on the temporal trend of breast cancer incidence, we analyzed data from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study of breast cancer recently completed among Chinese women in urban Shanghai, In-person interviews were completed for 1,459 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer between ages 25 and 64 and for 1,556 controls frequency-matched to cases by age. Unconditional logistic regression was employed to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) related to menstrual and reproductive factors. Earlier menarcheal age, nulliparity, and later age at first live birth were associated with increased risk of breast cancer among both pre- and post-menopausal women, while never having breast-fed and later age at menopause were associated with elevated risk only among post- menopausal women. Among controls, 32% of younger women (≤40 years) and 24% of older women (>40 years) reported starting menarche at age of 13 or younger, and this factor contributed to 44% of cases diagnosed among younger women and 26% to 28% of cases in older women. Older age at first live birth or at menopause explained a considerable portion of cases diag- nosed in older, but not younger, women. Our study suggests that the changes in menstrual and reproductive patterns among women in Shanghai have contributed to the recent increase in breast cancer incidence, particularly among younger women.

77954153479	Identification of a functional genetic variant at 16q12.1 for breast cancer risk: Results from the Asia breast cancer consortium	Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. We carried out a multi-stage genome-wide association (GWA) study in over 28,000 cases and controls recruited from 12 studies conducted in Asian and European American women to identify genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. After analyzing 684,457 SNPs in 2,073 cases and 2,084 controls in Chinese women, we evaluated 53 SNPs for fast-track replication in an independent set of 4,425 cases and 1,915 controls of Chinese origin. Four replicated SNPs were further investigated in an independent set of 6,173 cases and 6,340 controls from seven other studies conducted in Asian women. SNP rs4784227 was consistently associated with breast cancer risk across all studies with adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.25 (1.202-1.31) per allele (P = 3.2×10

77954753875	Genetic and clinical predictors for breast cancer risk assessment and stratification among chinese women	Background Most of the genetic variants identified from genome-wide association studies of breast cancer have not been validated in Asian women. No risk assessment model that incorporates both genetic and clinical predictors is currently available to predict breast cancer risk in this population. Methods We analyzed 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in recent genome-wide association studies mostly of women of European ancestry as being associated with the risk of breast cancer in 3039 case patients and 3082 control subjects who participated in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. All participants were interviewed in person to obtain information regarding known and suspected risk factors for breast cancer. The c statistic, a measure of discrimination ability with a value ranging from 0.5 (random classification) to 1.0 (perfect classification), was estimated to evaluate the contribution of genetic and established clinical predictors of breast cancer to a newly established risk assessment model for Chinese women. Clinical predictors included in the model were age at menarche, age at first live birth, waist-to-hip ratio, family history of breast cancer, and a previous diagnosis of benign breast disease. The utility of the models in risk stratification was evaluated by estimating the proportion of breast cancer patients in the general population that could be accounted for above a given risk threshold as predicted by the models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Eight SNPs (rs2046210, rs1219648, rs3817198, rs8051542, rs3803662, rs889312, rs10941679, and rs13281615), each of which reflected a genetically independent locus, were found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer. A dose-response association was observed between the risk of breast cancer and the genetic risk score, which is an aggregate measure of the effect of these eight SNPs (odds ratio for women in the highest quintile of genetic risk score vs those in the lowest = 1.85, 95% confidence interval = 1.58 to 2.18, Ptrend = 2.5 × 10

84867312253	Association of leukocyte telomere length with colorectal cancer risk: Nested case-control findings from the Shanghai women's health study	Background: Telomeres are specialized chromatin structures essential for maintenance of chromosomal integrity and stability. Abnormal alteration of telomere length has been linked to several cancers; however, epidemiologic evidence about the association of telomere length with colorectal cancer risk has been conflicting. Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study to evaluate the association between telomere length and colorectal cancer risk using peripheral blood samples collected before cancer diagnosis. The study included 441 women with incident colorectal cancer and 549 matched controls. Monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR was applied to measure relative telomere length. Multiple logistic regressions were used to derive adjusted OR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measure of association between telomere length and subsequent colorectal cancer risk. Results: A U-shaped association was observed between telomere length and colorectal cancer risk (test for nonlinearity P = 0.0112). Women with telomere length in the third quintile (40th-60th percentiles) had the lowest risk of colorectal cancer, and the risks were elevated with a shorter or longer telomere length. This U-shaped association did not statistically differ for colon cancer and rectum cancer. Conclusions and Impact: Our prospective study revealed a U-shaped association between telomere length in peripheral blood cells and colorectal cancer risk. Our findings provide strong evidence that both very short and very long telomeres are associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. ©2012 AACR.

44449146560	The Shanghai women's asthma and allergy study: Objectives, design, and recruitment results	The Shanghai Women's Asthma and Allergy Study is the first population-based incidence study designed to assess the associations of dietary antioxidant intake and measures of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activity with development of adult-onset asthma and allergic rhinitis. A total of 65,732 participants in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, an ongoing cohort study in seven districts of Shanghai, People's Republic of China, were recruited to the Shanghai Women's Asthma and Allergy Study from 2003 to 2007. Dietary intake was assessed in the parent study by using a validated and quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline recruitment and at the first biennial follow-up survey. Blood and urine samples were collected to measure baseline oxidative stress, antioxidant enzyme activity, and nutrient levels at the baseline survey. Incident asthma and allergic rhinitis were assessed by using a modification of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire during the biennial in-person survey of the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by either methacholine challenge testing or test of reversibility to beta-agonists. Dietary antioxidant intake, plasma antioxidants, antioxidant enzymes, and urinary isoprostanes, a marker of oxidative stress, were measured prior to disease onset.

4544280637	The long-term impact of medical and socio-demographic factors on the quality of life of breast cancer survivors among Chinese women	Quality of life (QOL) has become an integral part of the modern assessment of cancer treatment in Western society. However, little is known about the QOL of Chinese breast cancer survivors. To evaluate the long-term impact of medical and socio-demographic factors on survivors' QOL, we conducted a population-based study of 1065 breast cancer survivors in Shanghai, China. The mean age at diagnosis was 48.1 years and the median survival time was 4.3 years for the study participants. The Generic Quality of Life Inventory was used to assess survivors' QOL. Multiple linear regression models were employed to analyze the associations of QOL outcomes with socio-demographic and medical factors. The results revealed that recurrence status, time since diagnosis, marital status, income and education all had an independent, significant association with overall QOL and differential domains of QOL. Age at diagnosis exhibited a dual effect on QOL, positively associated with material well-being and negatively associated with physical well-being. Stage of disease was only associated with social well-being, while the type of surgery was related to material well-being alone. No associations between QOL and chemotherapy or radiotherapy were found. Further, analyses by survival intervals suggested a domain-specific order of recovery of QOL after cancer treatment. These results fill gaps in the limited literature, and provide valuable information for physicians to target the specific needs of Chinese women with breast cancer, choose appropriate interventions at the optimal time, and develop strategies accordingly in terms of improvement of patient's QOL.

49349091234	The association of alcohol, tea, and other modifiable lifestyle factors with myocardial infarction and stroke in Chinese men	Background: Studies of the lifestyle predictors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been predominantly conducted in Caucasian populations. There are few data from other populations, such as Chinese men, who have different lifestyles and a different spectrum of CVD as compared with Caucasian populations. Methods: Based on the baseline data of the Shanghai Men's Health Study during March 2002-June 2006, a matched case-control analysis including 518 myocardial infarction, 333 hemorrhagic stroke, and 1927 ischemic stroke cases was conducted. Five controls were selected for each case. The lifestyle factors under study included alcohol, tea and ginseng consumption, physical activity during adolescence, and weight change from age 20 to 40. The associations of these lifestyle factors with myocardial infarction and stroke were evaluated. To account for the misclassification of exposures and disease diagnosis, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results: Alcohol consumption was inversely associated with myocardial infarction (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.80). Tea consumption was inversely associated with hemorrhagic (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.81) and ischemic stroke (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.85). Weight increase from age 20 to 40 was positively associated with myocardial infarction and stroke in a dose-response manner (trend p < 0.001). Conclusions: Alcohol and tea consumption may decrease the prevalence of myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. Weight increase from age 20 to 40 may increase the prevalence of myocardial infarction and stroke in Chinese men. © 2008 World Heart Federation.

52049104950	The modifying effect of C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms on the association between central obesity and endometrial cancer risk	BACKGROUND. Obesity is a major risk factor for endometrial cancer. Obesity, particularly central obesity, is considered as a systemic inflammatory condition and is related strongly to insulin resistance. C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most recognized biologic marker of chronic systematic inflammation, and it is conceivable that the CRP gene may work together with obesity in the development of endometrial cancer. METHODS. On the basis of a population-based case-control study in a Chinese population, the authors obtained obesity measurements and data on 6 CRP single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1046 patients with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer (cases) and from 1035 age frequency-matched controls. The association of the CRP SNPs with endometrial cancer risk and their modification on the association between obesity and endometrial cancer risk were evaluated. RESULTS. Although CRP SNPs alone were not associated with endometrial cancer, the associations of endometrial cancer with central obesity, measured as the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and the waist circumference, seemed to be stronger in women who were homozygous for the major allele of reference SNP (rs)1130864 (cytidine [C]/C) than in women who had the C/thymidine (T) and T/T genotypes (interaction test: P = .013 for WHR; P = .083 for waist circumference). When the women were stratified further by menopausal status, the observed interactions persisted mainly in premenopausal women (interaction test: P <.001 for WHR; P = .002 for waist circumference). CONCLUSIONS. The current results suggested that, in the Chinese population that was studied, obesity-related insulin resistance and proinflammatory effects may play an important role in endometrial cancer risk, and these effects were modified significantly by the CRP SNP rs1130864. © 2008 American Cancer Society.

53949118953	Circulating transforming growth factor-β-1 and breast cancer prognosis: Results from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study	Introduction: Studies investigating the prognostic effect of circulating TGF-β-1 in breast cancer have given inconsistent findings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether circulating transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β-1) is associated with overall and disease-free survival in a cohort of recently diagnosed breast cancer patients. Methods: We measured TGF-β-1 levels in plasma samples of breast cancer patients in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study. We evaluated the relationship between TGF-β-1 levels and overall and disease-free survival. The median follow up time was 7.2 years. Results: We observed that, compared with the patients with the lowest quartile of plasma TGF-β-1, patients with the highest quartile of plasma TGF-β-1 had significantly worse overall survival with hazards ratio (HR) = 2.78, with 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-5.79 and disease-free survival with HR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.15-5.41, while the patients with the second and third quartiles of plasma TGF-β-1 did not have significantly different overall and disease-free breast cancer survival. The shape of association between plasma TGF-β-1 levels and breast cancer survival appears to be non-linear. Stratified analysis by stage of disease did not appreciably change the association pattern. Conclusions: We conclude that the relationship between circulating levels of TGF-β-1 and prognosis in breast cancer is complex and non-linear. High levels of TGF-β-1 are associated with worse survival independent of stage of disease. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

61349163553	Genome-wide association study identifies a new breast cancer susceptibility locus at 6q25.1	We carried out a genome-wide association study among Chinese women to identify risk variants for breast cancer. After analyzing 607,728 SNPs in 1,505 cases and 1,522 controls, we selected 29 SNPs for a fast-track replication in an independent set of 1,554 cases and 1,576 controls. We further investigated four replicated loci in a third set of samples comprising 3,472 cases and 900 controls. SNP rs2046210 at 6q25.1, located upstream of the gene encoding estrogen receptor α (ESR1), showed strong and consistent association with breast cancer across all three stages. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) were 1.36 (1.24-1.49) and 1.59 (1.40-1.82), respectively, for genotypes A/G and A/A versus G/G (P for trend 2.0 × 10

66849115652	Adolescent and adult soy food intake and breast cancer risk: Results from the Shanghai Women's Health Study	Background: Soy food is a rich source of isoflavones - a class of phytoestrogens that has both antiestrogenic and anticarcinogenic properties. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the association of adolescent and adult soy food intake with breast cancer risk in a cohort of 73,223 Chinese women who participated in the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Design: A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess usual dietary intake during adulthood and adolescence. After a mean follow-up of 7.4 y, 592 incident cases of breast cancer were identified for longitudinal analyses by using Cox regressions. Results: Adult soy food consumption, measured either by soy protein or isoflavone intake, was inversely associated with the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, and the association was highly statistically significant (P for trend < 0.001). The multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for the upper intake quintile compared with the lowest quintile were 0.41 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.70) for soy protein intake and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.73) for isoflavone intake. High intake of soy foods during adolescence was also associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer (RR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.97). Women who consumed a high amount of soy foods consistently during adolescence and adulthood had a substantially reduced risk of breast cancer. No significant association with soy food consumption was found for postmenopausal breast cancer. Conclusion: This large, population-based, prospective cohort study provides strong evidence of a protective effect of soy food intake against premenopausal breast cancer. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.

71549133042	Is Green Tea Drinking Associated With a Later Onset of Breast Cancer?	Background: Studies have found that tea polyphenols inhibit aromatase. Because of the substantial difference in levels of estrogens between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, the relationship between tea consumption and breast cancer risk may depend on menopausal status. Methods: We examined this hypothesis in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a population-based cohort study of 74,942 Chinese women. Results: We found a time-dependent interaction between green tea consumption and age of breast cancer onset (p for interaction, 0.03). In comparison with non-tea drinkers, women who started tea-drinking at 25 years of age or younger had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-1.17) to develop premenopausal breast cancer. On the other hand, compared with non-tea drinkers, women who started tea drinking at 25 years of age or younger had an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer with an HR of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.18-2.20). Additional analyses suggest regularly drinking green tea may delay the onset of breast cancer. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to confirm our findings. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

74849083753	Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region and breast cancer risk	Mitochondrial genome alterations have been suggested to play an important role in carcinogenesis. The D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contains essential transcription and replication elements, and mutations in this region may serve as a potential sensor for cellular DNA damage and a marker for cancer development. Using data and samples from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, we investigated MnlI restriction sites located between nucleotides 16,106 and 16,437 of the mtDNA D-loop region to evaluate restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns in tumor tissue from 501 primary breast cancer patients when compared with tumor tissue from 203 women with benign breast disease (BBD). RFLP patterns in correspondingly paired, adjacent, non-tumor tissues taken from 120 primary breast cancer patients and 59 BBD controls were also evaluated. Five common RFLP patterns were observed, and no significant differences were observed in the distribution of these patterns between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples from breast cancer patients and tissue samples from BBD controls. On the other hand, somatic MnlI site mutations, defined as a difference in MnlI RFLP pattern between tumor tissue and the corresponding, adjacent, non-tumor tissue, occurred more frequently in breast cancer patients (28.3%) than in BBD patients (15.3%) (P = 0.05) and more frequently in proliferative BBD (13.0%) than in non-proliferative BBD (7.1%). Our data suggest that somatic MnlI site mutations may play a role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77956157177	Development of a nomogram for identification of asthma among adults in epidemiologic studies	Background The criteria used to identify persons with asthma in epidemiologic studies are varying and, depending on the method used, can be challenging and resource consuming. Objective To develop a nomogram (scoring system) to identify adult patients with asthma using a combination of variables collected via a validated questionnaire. Methods We studied the first 268 women aged 40 to 69 years in the Shanghai Women's Asthma and Allergy Study who reported signs and symptoms of asthma and underwent either methacholine challenge testing or test of reversibility during the asthma screening survey between 2003 and 2007. These women were defined as having definite asthma (n = 106) or not (n = 162). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a predictive model for identifying asthma using survey information alone. Results Clinically relevant questions were used for the predictive multivariable logistic regression model and included the following: ever wheezing or whistling in the chest, current medication use for asthma, self-reported ever asthma, self-reported ever allergic rhinitis, family history of allergy, and age. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.690.81). A nomogram was developed to assess the individual probability of asthma based on individually weighted variables in the predictive model. Conclusions In clinical or epidemiologic studies, this asthma nomogram could be used as a tool to assess the probability of asthma for an individual patient by incorporating asthma-related predictor variables obtained through a field questionnaire. © 2010 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

77956533049	Evaluation of breast cancer susceptibility loci in Chinese women	Background: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), mostly conducted among women of European ancestry, have identified 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with breast cancer. Methods: We evaluated these SNPs with the risk of breast cancer and further by estrogen receptor status in a population-based study of 6,498 cases and 3,999 controls in Chinese women. We also searched for novel genetic risk variants in four loci, 2q35, 5p12/MRPS30, 8q24.21, and 17q23.2/COX11, in a two-stage study. In stage I, 868 SNPs were analyzed in 2,073 cases and 2,084 controls. In stage II, 58 SNPs selected from stage I were evaluated, including 4,425 cases and 1,915 controls. Results: Statistically significant associations (P < 0.05) were observed for eight GWAS-identified SNPs, including rs4973768 (3p24/SLC4A7), rs889312 (5q11.2MAP3K1), rs2046210 (6q25.1), rs1219648 (10q26.13/ FGFR2), rs2981582 (10q26.13/FGFR2), rs3817198 (11p15.5/LSP1), rs8051542 (16q12.1/TOX3), and rs3803662 (16q12.1/TOX3). Two additional SNPs, rs10941679 (5p12/MRPS30) and rs13281615 (8q24.21), showed a marginally significant association. Some of these associations varied by estrogen receptor status. In the fine-mapping analysis, five SNPs showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk in both stages: rs10169372 (2q35), rs283720 (8q24.21), rs10515083 (17q23.2/COX11), rs16955329 (17q23.2/COX11), and rs2787487 (17q23.2/COX11). Conclusions: This study shows that approximately half of the SNPs initially reported from GWAS of breast cancer in European descendants can be directly replicated in Chinese. Our fine-mapping analyses revealed several candidates of risk variants that can be further evaluated in studies with a larger sample size. Impact: Findings from this study may help guide future fine-mapping studies to identify causal variants for breast cancer. ©2010 AACR.

77957862628	Combined impact of lifestyle-related factors on total and cause-specific mortality among chinese women: Prospective cohort study	Background: Although cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol drinking, obesity, and several other well-studied unhealthy lifestyle-related factors each have been linked to the risk of multiple chronic diseases and premature death, little is known about the combined impact on mortality outcomes, in particular among Chinese and other non-Western populations. The objective of this study was to quantify the overall impact of lifestyle-related factors beyond that of active cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Chinese women. Methods and Findings: We used data from the Shanghai Women's Health Study, an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study in China. Participants included 71,243 women aged 40 to 70 years enrolled during 1996-2000 who never smoked or drank alcohol regularly. A healthy lifestyle score was created on the basis of five lifestyle-related factors shown to be independently associated with mortality outcomes (normal weight, lower waist-hip ratio, daily exercise, never exposed to spouse's smoking, higher daily fruit and vegetable intake). The score ranged from zero (least healthy) to five (most healthy) points. During an average follow-up of 9 years, 2,860 deaths occurred, including 775 from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 1,351 from cancer. Adjusted hazard ratios for mortality decreased progressively with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle factors. Compared to women with a score of zero, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for women with four to five factors were 0.57 (0.44-0.74) for total mortality, 0.29 (0.16-0.54) for CVD mortality, and 0.76 (0.54-1.06) for cancer mortality. The inverse association between the healthy lifestyle score and mortality was seen consistently regardless of chronic disease status at baseline. The population attributable risks for not having 4-5 healthy lifestyle factors were 33% for total deaths, 59% for CVD deaths, and 19% for cancer deaths. Conclusions: In this first study, to our knowledge, to quantify the combined impact of lifestyle-related factors on mortality outcomes in Chinese women, a healthier lifestyle pattern-including being of normal weight, lower central adiposity, participation in physical activity, nonexposure to spousal smoking, and higher fruit and vegetable intake-was associated with reductions in total and cause-specific mortality among lifetime nonsmoking and nondrinking women, supporting the importance of overall lifestyle modification in disease prevention. © 2010 Nechuta et al.

78049438674	Identification of new genetic risk variants for Type 2 Diabetes	Although more than 20 genetic susceptibility loci have been reported for type 2 diabetes (T2D), most reported variants have small to moderate effects and account for only a small proportion of the heritability of T2D, suggesting that the majority of inter-person genetic variation in this disease remains to be determined. We conducted a multistage, genome-wide association study (GWAS) within the Asian Consortium of Diabetes to search for T2D susceptibility markers. From 590,887 SNPs genotyped in 1,019 T2D cases and 1,710 controls selected from Chinese women in Shanghai, we selected the top 2,100 SNPs that were not in linkage disequilibrium (r

79551469665	Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk in Chinese women: A prospective cohort study	Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Controversy exists regarding the role of dietary fat in breast cancer etiology. We investigated the association of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the ratio of n-6 PUFAs to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs with breast cancer risk in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study including 72,571 cancer-free participants at baseline. Dietary fatty acid intake was determined using food frequency questionnaires. We used Cox proportional hazards analysis to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of breast cancer risk with dietary fatty acids consumption. In 583,998 person-years of follow-up, we identified 712 breast cancer cases. We found no association of breast cancer risk to dietary intake of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, α-linolenic acid or marine-derived n-3 PUFA. We found a statistically significant interaction between n-6 PUFA intake, marine-derived n-3 PUFA intake and breast cancer risk (p = 0.008). Women with lower intake (the lowest tertile) of marine-derived n-3 PUFA and higher intake (the highest tertile) of n-6 PUFA had an increase risk for breast cancer (RR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.27-3.34) compared to women with higher intake (the highest tertile) of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs and lower intake (the lowest tertile) of n-6 PUFAs after adjusting for potential confounders. The relative amounts of n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs may be more important for breast cancer risk than individual dietary amounts of these fatty acids. Copyright © 2010 UICC.

0035877084	Abortion history and breast cancer risk: Results from the Shanghai breast cancer study	Studies of the association between induced abortion and breast cancer risk have been inconsistent, perhaps due to underreporting of abortions. Induced abortion is a well-accepted family planning procedure in China, and women who have several induced abortions do not feel stigmatized. The authors used data from a population-based case-control study of breast cancer among women age 25-64 conducted between 1996 and 1998 in urban Shanghai to assess whether a history of and the number of induced abortions were related to breast cancer risk. In-person interviews were completed with 1,459 incident breast cancer cases ascertained through a population-based cancer registry, and 1,556 controls randomly selected from the general population in Shanghai (with respective response rates of 91% and 90%). After adjusting for confounding, there was no relation between ever having had an induced abortion and breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.2). Women who had 3 or more induced abortions were not at increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer (OR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.4) or postmenopausal breast cancer (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.8-2.3). These results suggest that a history of several induced abortions has little influence on breast cancer risk in Chinese women. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

81855226435	Genome-wide association study identifies breast cancer risk variant at 10q21.2: Results from the asia breast cancer consortium	Although approximately 20 common genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for breast cancer risk through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), genetic risk variants reported to date explain only a small fraction of heritability for this common cancer. We conducted a four-stage GWAS including 17 153 cases and 16 943 controls among East-Asian women to search for new genetic risk factors for breast cancer. After analyzing 684 457 SNPs in 2062 cases and 2066 controls (Stage I), we selected for replication among 5969 Chinese women (4146 cases and 1823 controls) the top 49 SNPs that had neither been reported previously nor were in strong linkage disequilibrium with reported SNPs (Stage II). Three SNPs were further evaluated in up to 13 152 Chinese and Japanese women (6436 cases and 6716 controls) (Stage III). Finally, two SNPs were evaluated in 10 847 Korean women (4509 cases and 6338 controls) (Stage IV). SNP rs10822013 on chromosome 10q21.2, located in the zinc finger protein 365 (ZNF365) gene, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk in all four stages with a combined per-risk allele odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.07-1.14) (P-value for trend = 5.87 × 10

We aimed to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. After analyzing 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, we evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls. Ninety-four SNPs were further evaluated in 5,203 cases and 5,138 controls, and finally the top 22 SNPs were investigated in up to 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls).

84862519959	Genetic polymorphisms in obesity-related genes and endometrial cancer risk	BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin and endometrial cancer risk. Little is known about whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes that encode adiponectin (ADIPOQ), leptin (LEP), adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1), adiponectin receptor 2 (ADIPOR2), and leptin receptor (LEPR) are associated with endometrial cancer. METHODS: The authors selected 87 tagging SNPs to capture common genetic variants in these 5 genes. These SNPs were evaluated in 1028 endometrial cancer cases and 1932 community controls recruited from Chinese women. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Three of the 10 SNPs evaluated in the ADIPOQ gene were significantly associated with reduced cancer risk. The OR for women homozygous for the minor allele (A/A) for rs3774262 was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48-0.97) compared with women homozygous for the major allele (G/G). Similar results were found for SNPs rs1063539 and rs12629945 in ADIPOQ, which were in linkage disequilibrium with rs3774262. These associations became nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction was applied. Controls with the minor allele A at rs3774262 had lower weight, smaller waist and hip circumferences, and lower body mass index than controls with the major allele G (all P <.05). Women homozygous for the minor allele (T/T) of rs2071045 in the LEP gene also had significantly lower risk (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90) than women homozygous for the major allele (C/C). No other SNPs in the LEP, ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2, or LEPR genes were found to be associated with cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Although a chance finding cannot be ruled out, the consistency of findings for gene-endometrial cancer risk and gene-obesity measurements suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene may play a role in endometrial cancer development. © 2011 American Cancer Society.

84862564504	Association of genetic variation in FTO with risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes with data from 96,551 East and South Asians	Aims/hypothesis FTO harbours the strongest known obesity-susceptibility locus in Europeans. While there is growing evidence for a role for FTO in obesity risk in Asians, its association with type 2 diabetes, independently of BMI, remains inconsistent. To test whether there is an association of the FTO locus with obesity and type 2 diabetes, we conducted a meta-analysis of 32 populations including 96,551 East and South Asians. Methods All studies published on the association between FTO-rs9939609 (or proxy [r2>0.98]) and BMI, obesity or type 2 diabetes in East or South Asians were invited. Each study group analysed their data according to a standardised analysis plan. Association with type 2 diabetes was also adjusted for BMI. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to pool all effect sizes. Results The FTO-rs9939609 minor allele increased risk of obesity by 1.25-fold/allele (p=9.0×10

84862822438	Common variants at CDKAL1 and KLF9 are associated with body mass index in east Asian populations	Obesity is a disorder with a complex genetic etiology, and its epidemic is a worldwide problem. Although multiple genetic loci associated with body mass index, the most common measure of obesity, have been identified in European populations, few studies have focused on Asian populations. Here we report a genome-wide association study and replication studies with 62,245 east Asian subjects, which identified two new body mass indexĝ€"associated loci in the CDKAL1 locus at 6p22 (rs2206734, P = 1.4 - 10 g11) and the KLF9 locus at 9q21 (rs11142387, P = 1.3 - 10 g9), as well as several previously reported loci (the SEC16B, BDNF, FTO, MC4R and GIPR loci, P < 5.0 - 10 g8). We subsequently performed gene-gene interaction analyses and identified an interaction (P = 2.0 - 10 g8) between a SNP in the KLF9 locus (rs11142387) and one in the MSTN (also known as GDF8) locus at 2q32 (rs13034723). These findings should provide useful insights into the etiology of obesity. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

84862777036	Meta-analysis identifies common variants associated with body mass index in east Asians	Multiple genetic loci associated with obesity or body mass index (BMI) have been identified through genome-wide association studies conducted predominantly in populations of European ancestry. We performed a meta-analysis of associations between BMI and approximately 2.4 million SNPs in 27,715 east Asians, which was followed by in silico and de novo replication studies in 37,691 and 17,642 additional east Asians, respectively. We identified ten BMI-associated loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 - 10 g8), including seven previously identified loci (FTO, SEC16B, MC4R, GIPR-QPCTL, ADCY3-DNAJC27, BDNF and MAP2K5) and three novel loci in or near the CDKAL1, PCSK1 and GP2 genes. Three additional loci nearly reached the genome-wide significance threshold, including two previously identified loci in the GNPDA2 and TFAP2B genes and a newly identified signal near PAX6, all of which were associated with BMI with P < 5.0 - 10 g7. Findings from this study may shed light on new pathways involved in obesity and demonstrate the value of conducting genetic studies in non-European populations. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

0036816349	Birthweight, childhood growth and hypertension in adulthood	Background. Low birthweight (BW) and childhood growth have been hypothesized to be associated with an increased risk of hypertension in later life. Methods. We analysed data among 13 467 women with a recalled BW from the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Cases included those with a self-reported hypertension with ('confirmed cases') or without ('possible cases') antihypertensive medication(s) use. Logistic regression was used to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % CI. Results. Birthweight was inversely associated with the odds of early onset (at age 20-40 years) hypertension in a dose response manner (P for trend = 0.01). This association is stronger for 'confirmed' hypertension (only OR for 'confirmed' hypertension are referred to subsequently). Being heavier or taller than average at 15 years of age were both related to elevated odds of early onset hypertension. Women who had a low BW but were heavier than average at age 15 were more than four times (OR = 4.63, 95% CI: 2.40-8.94) more likely to have an early onset hypertension, and those who had a low BW and became taller at 15 years of age had an OR of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.05-3.31). A significant interaction between BW and weight at age 15 was observed (P = 0.04). Conclusion. Our study suggests that low BW, particularly if accompanied by accelerated childhood growth, may increase the risk of early onset hypertension in adulthood.

84872244478	Gene-environment interactions for breast cancer risk among chinese women: A report from the shanghai breast cancer genetics study	Genome-wide association studies have identified approximately 20 susceptibility loci for breast cancer. A cumulative genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed from 10 variants with replicated associations among participants of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Genetics Study (Shanghai, China, 1996-1998 and 2002-2005). Interactions between the GRS and 11 breast cancer risk factors were evaluated. Among the 6,408 study participants, no evidence of effect modification was found with the GRS for age at menarche, age at menopause, age at first live birth/parity, total months of breastfeeding, family history of breast cancer, history of benign breast disease, hormone replacement therapy, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, or regular physical activity. The effect of the GRS was least homogeneous by duration of menstruation; further analysis indicated a nominally significant interaction with one genetic variant. The mitochondrial ribosomal protein S30 gene (MRPS30) rs10941679 was associated with breast cancer risk only among women with more than 30 years of menstruation (odds ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.26). Although this multiplicative interaction reached a nominal significance level (P = 0.037), it did not withstand correction for multiple comparisons. In conclusion, this study revealed no apparent interactions between genome-wide association study-identified genetic variants and breast cancer risk factors in the etiology of this common cancer.Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GRS, genetic risk score; OR, odds ratio; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. © 2012 The Author.

84873342687	Polymorphisms in inflammation pathway genes and endometrial cancer risk	Background: Experimental and epidemiologic evidence have suggested that chronic inflammation may play a critical role in endometrial carcinogenesis. Methods: To investigate this hypothesis, a two-stage study was carried out to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in inflammatory pathway genes in association with endometrial cancer risk. In stage I, 64 candidate pathway genes were identified and 4,542 directly genotyped or imputed SNPs were analyzed among 832 endometrial cancer cases and 2,049 controls, using data from the Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Genetics Study. Linkage disequilibrium of stage I SNPs significantly associated with endometrial cancer (P < 0.05) indicated that the majority of associations could be linked to one of 24 distinct loci. One SNP from each of the 24 loci was then selected for follow-up genotyping. Of these, 21 SNPs were successfully designed and genotyped in stage II, which consisted of 10 additional studies including 6,604 endometrial cancer cases and 8,511 controls. Results: Five of the 21 SNPs had significant allelic odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as follows: FABP1, 0.92 (0.85-0.99); CXCL3, 1.16 (1.05-1.29); IL6, 1.08 (1.00-1.17); MSR1, 0.90 (0.82-0.98); and MMP9, 0.91 (0.87-0.97). Two of these polymorphisms were independently significant in the replication sample (rs352038 in CXCL3 and rs3918249 in MMP9). The association for the MMP9 polymorphism remained significant after Bonferroni correction and showed a significant association with endometrial cancer in both Asian- and European-ancestry samples. Conclusions: These findings lend support to the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in the inflammatory pathway may contribute to genetic susceptibility to endometrial cancer. Impact statement: This study adds to the growing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in endometrial carcinogenesis. © 2012 American Association for Cancer Research.

84875622574	Evaluation of GWAS-identified genetic variants for age at menarche among Chinese women	STUDY QUESTION: Do genetic polymorphisms which influence age at menarche in women of European ancestry also influence women of Chinese ancestry?SUMMARY ANSWERMany genetic variants influencing age at menarche in European populations appear to impact Chinese populations in a similar manner.WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT THIS PAPER ADDSPrior genome-wide association studies have uncovered 42 SNPs associated with age at menarche in European populations. This study is the first to demonstrate that many of the genetic determinants of age at menarche are shared between European and Chinese women.PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGWe evaluated 37 of 42 SNPs identified as associated with age at menarche from a recent, large meta-analysis, consisting primarily of women of European ancestry, in a population of 6929 Chinese women from Shanghai, China. We also constructed weighted genetic risk scores (GRSs) combining the number of effect variants for all 37 SNPs, or only the SNPs associated with age at menarche among our study population, to evaluate their joint influence on age at menarche.MAIN RESULTSFor 32 of the 37 evaluated variants, the direction of the allele associations were the same between women of European ancestry and women of Chinese ancestry (P = 3.71 × 10

84876538745	Prediagnosis soy food consumption and lung cancer survival in women	Purpose We recently reported an inverse association between soy food intake and lung cancer risk among nonsmoking women. The effect size for aggressive lung cancers was larger than that observed for other types of lung cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that soy consumption may favorably affect the overall survival of patients with lung cancer. Patients and Methods This analysis included 444 women with incident lung cancer identified from the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Prediagnosis soy food intake was assessed at enrollment and reassessed 2 years later. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between soy food intake and overall survival. Results Of the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during follow-up. Initial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factors. Larger effect sizes for the association were found after additional adjustment for tumor stage and treatment in analyses including 301 patients with data available on these clinical factors. Compared with the median intake of soy food, fully adjusted hazard ratios for total mortality associated with the 10th, 30th, 70th, and 90th percentiles of intake were 1.81 (95% CI, 1.26 to 2.59), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.42), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16), respectively. Similar inverse associations were observed for dietary isoflavone intake. Conclusion This study suggests, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that, among women with lung cancer, prediagnosis intake of soy food is associated with better overall survival. © 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

84878508496	Common genetic determinants of breast-cancer risk in east asian women: A collaborative study of 23 637 breast cancer cases and 25 579 controls	In a consortium including 23 637 breast cancer patients and 25 579 controls of East Asian ancestry, we investigated70 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 67 independent breast cancer susceptibility loci recently identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted primarily in European-ancestry populations. SNPs in 31 loci showed an association with breast cancer risk at P < 0.05 in a direction consistent with that reported previously. Twenty-one of them remained statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni-corrected significance level of <0.0015. Eight of the 70 SNPs showed a significantly different association with breast cancer risk by estrogen receptor (ER) status at P < 0.05. With the exception of rs2046210 at 6q25.1, the seven other SNPs showed a stronger association with ER-positive than ER-negative cancer. This study replicated all five genetic risk variants initially identified in Asians and provided evidence for associations of breast cancer risk in the East Asian population with nearly half of the genetic risk variants initially reported in GWASs conducted in European descendants. Taken together, these common genetic risk variants explain ~10% of excess familial risk of breast cancer in Asian populations. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

84884147847	No association between genetic variants in angiogenesis and inflammation pathway genes and breast cancer survival among Chinese women	Background: Angiogenesis and inflammation are implicated in breast cancer prognosis; however, the role of individual germline variation in related genes is unknown. Methods: A two-stage candidate pathway association study was conducted among 6983 Chinese women. Stage 1 included 2884 women followed for a median of 5.7 years; Stage 2 included 4099 women followed for a median of 4.0 years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effects of genetic variants on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Stage 1 included genotyping of 506 variants in 22 genes; analysis was conducted for 370 common variants. Nominally significant associations with DFS and/or OS were found for 20 loci in ten genes in Stage 1; variants in 19 loci were successfully genotyped and evaluated in Stage 2. In analyses of both study stages combined, nominally significant associations were found for nine variants in seven genes; none of these associations surpassed a significance threshold level corrected for the total number of variants evaluated in this study. Conclusions: No association with survival was found for 370 common variants in 22 angiogenesis and inflammation pathway genes among Chinese women with breast cancer. Impact: Our data do not support a large role for common genetic variation in 22 genes in breast cancer prognosis; research on angiogenesis and inflammation genes should focus on common variation in other genes, rare host variants, or tumor alterations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

0141633005	Genetic polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor α gene and risk of breast cancer: Results from the Shanghai breast cancer study	Estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates estrogen actions in target tissues. Several common polymorphisms of the ER-α gene have been reported to be associated with alterations in receptor expression and function. We evaluated the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the ER-α gene may be associated with breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study conducted in urban Shanghai during 1996-1998. Two RFLPs at the ER-α gene locus, denoted as PvuII and XbaI, were examined in 1069 breast cancer cases and 1166 age frequency-matched controls. PvuII polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer with the age-adjusted odds ratios for genotypes Pp and pp being 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-1.7) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8), respectively, comparing to genotype PP. The XbaI polymorphism was associated with a nonsignificantly elevated risk. The odds ratios for genotypes Xx and xx were 1. 2 (95% CI, 0.7-1.9) and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8-2.0), respectively, and the elevated risks were mainly confined to older or postmenopausal women. No apparent synergetic effect of these two polymorphisms was identified. Results of this study indicate that genetic polymorphisms in the ER-α gene may play a role in the etiology of breast cancer.

0041665025	Sociodemographic, behavioral, and reproductive factors associated with weight gain in Chinese women	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether certain sociodemographic, behavioral, and reproductive factors are associated with an increased weight gain in Chinese women. DESIGN: Baseline survey data, including recalled past weight and measured current weight, from an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted in Shanghai, China. SUBJECTS: The analytical sample included 75 039 nonpregnant women aged 40-70 y. MEASUREMENTS: Statistical associations between certain sociodemographic, behavioral, and reproductive factors and weight gain were evaluated using multiple linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Weight gain and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) increased with age among pre- and postmenopausal women before age 55 y. Weight gain declined but WHR continued rising as aging among postmenopausal women over age 55 y. Lower education levels, more parity and earlier age at the first birth, and earner menarcheal age were associated with a higher long-term weight gain and current body weight. CONCLUSION: Age, education levels, parity, age at the first live birth, and menarcheal age were associated with long-term weight gain in Chinese women. However, these results concerning weight gain are based on recalled past weight and should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are needed to clarify the association of weight gain with lifestyle factors suggested by this study.

84901686903	Large-scale genetic study in east Asians identifies six new loci associated with colorectal cancer risk	Known genetic loci explain only a small proportion of the familial relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a genome-wide association study of CRC in East Asians with 14,963 cases and 31,945 controls and identified 6 new loci associated with CRC risk (P = 3.42 × 10 ̂'8 to 9.22 × 10 â ̂'21) at 10q22.3, 10q25.2, 11q12.2, 12p13.31, 17p13.3 and 19q13.2. Two of these loci map to genes (TCF7L2 and TGFB1) with established roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. Four other loci are located in or near genes involved in transcriptional regulation (ZMIZ1), genome maintenance (FEN1), fatty acid metabolism (FADS1 and FADS2), cancer cell motility and metastasis (CD9), and cell growth and differentiation (NXN). We also found suggestive evidence for three additional loci associated with CRC risk near genome-wide significance at 8q24.11, 10q21.1 and 10q24.2. Furthermore, we replicated 22 previously reported CRC-associated loci.

We then selected 66 promising SNPs for replication and genotyped them in three independent studies with 3,612 cases and 3,523 controls. Five SNPs were further evaluated using data from four additional studies including up to 3,290 cases and 4,339 controls. SNP rs7229639 in the SMAD7 gene was found to be associated with CRC risk with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with the minor allele (A) of 1.22 (1.15-1.29) in the combined analysis of all 11 studies (p = 2.93 × 10

84920108259	Association of leukocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number with colorectal cancer risk: Results from the Shanghai Women's Health Study	Background: Mitochondria play an important role in cellular energy metabolism, free radical production, and apoptosis, and thus may be involved in cancer development. Methods: We evaluated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in peripheral leukocytes in relation to colorectal cancer risk in a case-control study of 444 colorectal cancer cases and 1,423 controls nested in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study. Relative mtDNA copy number was determined by a quantitative real-time PCR assay using peripheral leukocyte DNA samples collected at the time of study enrollment, before cancer diagnosis. Results: We found that baseline mtDNA copy number was lower among women who subsequently developed colorectal cancer [geometric mean, 0.277; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.269-0.285] than among women who remained cancer-free (geometric mean, 0.288; 95% CI, 0.284-0.293; P = 0.0153). Multivariate adjusted ORs were 1.26 (95% CI, 0.93-1.70) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.06-1.94) for the middle and lower tertiles of mtDNA copy number, respectively, compared with the upper tertile (highest mtDNA copy number; P

0742324546	Validity and reproducibility of the food frequency questionnaire used in the Shanghai Women's Health Study	To evaluate the validity and reliability of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), 200 SWHS participants were recruited for a dietary calibration study. Study participants completed an FFQ at baseline and 24-h dietary recalls (24-HDR) twice per month consecutively for 12 months. At the end of the study, a second FFQ was administered. Of the 200 study participants, 196 completed 24 or more days of 24-h dietary recalls, 191 completed two FFQs from whom the results of this report were based. The FFQ included the foods that accounted for 86% of the foods recorded in the 24-HDR surveys. Validity of the FFQ was evaluated by comparing intake levels of major nutrients and foods obtained from the second FFQ with those derived from the multiple 24-HDR. The median intake for major nutrients, rice, poultry and meat derived from the second FFQ and the 24-HDR was similar, with the differences ranging from 1.3 to 12.1%. The FFQ tended to overestimate the intake level of total vegetables and total fruits, and the differences were explained mainly by over-reporting seasonal vegetables and fruits consumption in the FFQ. Nutrient and food intake assessed by the FFQ and the multiple 24-HDR correlated very well, with the correlation coefficients being 0.59-0.66 for macronutrients, 0.41-0.59 for micronutrients, and 0.41-0.66 for major food groups. The reliability of the FFQ was assessed by comparing the correlation and median intake of nutrients and food groups obtained from the two FFQs that were administered approximately 2y apart. The median intake levels for selected nutrients and food groups derived from the two FFQs were similar with differences below 10%. At the individual level, the intake levels of these dietary variables obtained from two FFQs also correlated well. When nutrient and food group intakes were categorized into quartiles, FFQ and 24-HDR produced exact agreement rates between 33 and 50%. Misclassification to adjacent quartile was common, ranging from 34-48%, while misclassification to an extreme quartile was rare (1-6%). These data indicate that the SWHS FFQ can reliably and accurately measure usual intake of major nutrients and food groups among women in Shanghai.

0347363502	A Population-Based Case-Control Study of the Arg399Gln Polymorphism in DNA Repair Gene XRCC1 and Risk of Breast Cancer	XRCC1 (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1) is a base excision repair protein that plays a central role in the repair of DNA base damage and strand breaks. A common polymorphism (Arg→Gln) at codon 399 of the XRCC1 gene has been previously linked to functional changes of the gene product and risk of cancers. We evaluated the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and breast cancer risk in the population-based Shanghai Breast Cancer Study involving 1088 cancer patients and 1182 community controls. Genomic DNA from peripheral blood was used in genotyping assays, and exposure information and anthropometrics were collected through in-person interview. Plasma estrogen and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels were measured for 190 postmenopausal breast cancer patients who had donated a pretreatment blood sample and 407 postmenopausal controls. Conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) adjusting potential confounders. Approximately 27% of controls carried the variant allele (Gln), and cases and controls had a similar distribution for both allele type and genotype of this polymorphism. We found that 7.8% of cases and 6.3% of controls were homozygous for the variant allele, resulting in an OR of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.85-1.69). The OR was slightly higher among younger women [<45 years of age (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.82-2.36)] than older women [≥45 years of age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.68-1.67)], but neither OR was statistically significant. No modifying effect of major breast cancer risk factors, including years of menstruation, body mass index, waist: hip ratio, and blood estrogen levels, was noted. Homozygosity for the variant Gln allele was associated with an elevated risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among subjects with a higher blood level of SHBG (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.16-9.20) and a reduced risk among those with a lower level of SHBG (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.18-1.97). The overall results of the study suggest that Arg399Gln polymorphism of the XRCC1 gene alone may not play a substantial role in the risk of breast cancer among Chinese women.

11144234946	Synergistic effects of STK15 gene polymorphisms and endogenous estrogen exposure in the risk of breast cancer	STK15 is a member of a family of serine/threonine kinases that act as key regulators of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Overexpression of the STK15 gene leads to centrosome amplification, chromosomal instability, aneuploidy, and transformation. It has been reported that the 91T → A (Phe → Ile at codon 31) polymorphism in the STK15 gene affects the function of this gene. We hypothesized that this polymorphism may interact with endogenous estrogen exposure in the risk of breast cancer and evaluated this hypothesis in a population-based, case-control study conducted among Chinese women in Shanghai. Genotyping assays were completed for 1,102 incident cases and 1,186 community controls. Participation and blood donation rates were over 90% and 80%, respectively. Elevated risks of breast cancer were found to be associated with the Phe/Ile [odds ratio (OR), 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-1.7] and Ile/Ile (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.6) genotypes at codon 31 of the STK15 gene, although the ORs were not statistically significant. The risk associated with this polymorphism was modified by factors related to endogenous estrogen exposure, such as high body mass index (BMI), high waist-to-hip ratio, long duration of lifetime menstruation, or long duration of menstruation before first live birth. In particular, a statistically significant interaction was found between BMI and the STK15 Phe

10344233683	Insulin-like growth factor-I gene polymorphism and breast cancer risk in chinese women	The evidence that high circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women lends credence to the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the IGF-I gene may be involved in the disease. A population-based case-control study was conducted to assess the association of IGF-I gene polymorphisms [(CA)n repeats in the promoter region] with breast cancer risk and plasma IGF-I level in Chinese women. The study included 1,041 incident breast cancer cases diagnosed from August 1996 through March 1998 in Shanghai and 1,086 randomly selected, age frequency-matched controls from the general population. Although no relation between plasma IGF-I levels and IGF-I genotypes was found, women who carried the genotypes containing the (CA)17 or (CA)19 allele were associated with a significantly decreased (OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.64-1.00) or increased (OR=1.23, 95% CI: 1.04-1.47) risk of breast cancer, respectively, and women who carried the genotypes containing any of the 4 rare alleles, (CA)11, (CA)13, (CA)16 and (CA)23, were associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of breast cancer (OR=1.92, 95% CI: 0.92-4.02) compared to those who did not carry the specific alleles. The associations with the (CA)17 or (CA)19 allele were predominantly present among premenopausal women and in a dose-response manner. The meta-analysis results indicated that IGF-I genotypes containing the (CA)19 were consistently associated with increased risk of breast cancer across studies (overall OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.06-1.41, p for heterogeneity test=0.524). The findings of this study support the hypothesis that IGF-I gene polymorphisms may be a significant genetic factor for breast cancer susceptibility.

12944316447	Polymorphisms in ER-α gene interact with estrogen receptor status in breast cancer survival	Purpose: The effects of estrogens are mediated primarily through estrogen receptor (ER) in breast tissue, and polymorphisms in the ER genes may alter the functions of these receptors. Polymorphisms in the ER-α gene have been reported to be associated with breast cancer risk. However, to our knowledge, no study has been published on the relation between ER-α gene polymorphisms and breast cancer survival. Experimental Design: To determine whether three common polymorphisms in the ER-α gene, PvuII, XbaI, and GT dinucleotide repeats are associated with breast cancer survival, we evaluated data from a cohort of 1,069 breast cancer patients who participated in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study between 1996 and 1998. The median follow-up time for this cohort of women was 5.2 years. Results: No overall association was observed between ER gene polymorphisms and breast cancer survival. The genotype associations, however, were modified by ER status in breast cancer tissues. Comparing those with the PP genotype to the pp genotype of the PvuII polymorphism, the hazard ratios (HR) of dying were 3.30 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.42-7.69] and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.24-1.23), respectively, for participants with ER-negative breast cancer and ER-positive breast cancer. Similarly, compared with those with no (GT)
