84926415822	Switching from entecavir to PegIFN alfa-2a in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B: A randomized open-label trial (OSST trial)	Background & Aims: Durable post-treatment response is uncommon in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients on nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. Response, response predictors and safety were assessed in patients who switched from long-term entecavir (ETV) to peginterferon alfa-2a. Methods: Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients who had received ETV for 9-36 months, with HBeAg <100 PEIU/ ml and HBV DNA 61000 copies/ml, were randomised 1: 1 to receive peginterferon alfa-2a 180 lg/week or ETV 0.5 mg/day for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00940485). Results: 200 patients were randomised; 197 received P1 study drug dose. Five patients who were anti-HBe-positive at baseline were excluded from the modified intention-to-treat population (peginterferon alfa-2a, n = 94; ETV, n = 98). Patients who switched to peginterferon alfa-2a achieved higher week 48 HBeAg seroconversion rates vs. those who continued ETV (14.9% vs. 6.1%; p = 0.0467). Only patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a achieved HBsAg loss (8.5%). Among peginterferon alfa-2atreated patients with HBeAg loss and HBsAg <1500 IU/ml at randomisation, 33.3% and 22.2% achieved HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss, respectively. Early on-treatment HBsAg decline predicted response at week 48; highest rates were observed in patients with week 12 HBsAg <200 IU/ml (HBeAg seroconversion, 66.7%; HBsAg loss, 77.8%). Alanine aminotransferase elevations were not associated with viral rebound (n = 38). Peginterferon alfa-2a was well-tolerated. Conclusions: For patients who achieve virological suppression with ETV, switching to a finite course of peginterferon alfa-2a significantly increases rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss. A response-guided approach may identify patients with the greatest chance of success.

17944361917	Medical ultrasonic image filtering method based on anisotropic diffusion	To remove the speckle noise in ultrasonic images by using anisotropic diffusion method. Based on anisotropic diffusion, a partial differential equation, of which the initial data was the input images, was transformed into differential forms and solved with iterations. The speckle scale function of the equation was modified to make better use in filtering medical ultrasonic images. By comparing the results with other three filters, the anisotropic diffusion method could smooth the speckles very well and the edge of the image was also clear. Anisotropic diffusion can remove the speckle noise effectively and has great potential in filtering medical ultrasonic images.

17444430845	The transcriptional transactivation function of HBx protein is important for its augmentation role in hepatitis B virus replication	The role and functional domain of hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) in regulating HBV transcription and replication were investigated with a transient transfection system in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 using wild-type or HBx-minus HBV genome constructs and a series of deletion or mutation HBx expression plasmids. We show here that HBx has augmentation effects on HBV transcription and replication as a HBV mutant genome with defective X gene led to decreased levels of 3.5-kb HBV RNA and HBV replication intermediates and that these decreases can be restored by either transient ectopic expression of HBx or a stable HBx expression cell line. The C-terminal two-thirds (amino acids [aa] 51 to 154), which contain the transactivation domain, is required for this function of HBx; the N-terminal one-third (aa 1 to 50) is not required. Using the alanine scanning mutagenesis strategy, we demonstrated that the regions between aa 52 to 65 and 88 to 154 are important for the augmentation function of HBx in HBV replication. By the luciferase reporter gene analysis, we found that the transactivation and coactivation activities of HBx coincide well with its augmentation function in HBV transcription and replication. These results suggest that HBx has an important role in stimulating HBV transcription and replication and that the transcriptional transactivation function of HBx may be critical for its augmentation effect on HBV replication.

19944396452	Proteomic fingerprints for potential application to early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome	Background: Definitive early-stage diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is important despite the number of laboratory tests that have been developed to complement clinical features and epidemiologic data in case definition. Pathologic changes in response to viral infection might be reflected in proteomic patterns in sera of SARS patients. Methods: We developed a mass spectrometric decision tree classification algorithm using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Serum samples were grouped into acute SARS (n = 74; <7 days after onset of fever) and non-SARS [n = 1067; fever and influenza A (n = 203), pneumonia (n = 176); lung cancer (n = 29); and healthy controls (n = 659)] cohorts. Diluted samples were applied to WCX-2 ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen), and the bound proteins were assessed on a ProteinChip Reader (Model PBS II). Bioinformatic calculations were performed with Biomarker Wizard software 3.1.1 (Ciphergen). Results: The discriminatory classifier with a panel of four biomarkers determined in the training set could precisely detect 36 of 37 (sensitivity, 97.3%) acute SARS and 987 of 993 (specificity, 99.4%) non-SARS samples. More importantly, this classifier accurately distinguished acute SARS from fever and influenza with 100% specificity (187 of 187). Conclusions: This method is suitable for preliminary assessment of SARS and could potentially serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis. © 2005 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

23044488813	Polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (essentiale) for chronic hepatitis: A systematic review	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PPC) for chronic hepatitis. Methods: We searched EMBASE (1980 - May,2003), MEDLINE (1966-May,2003), CBM (1979 -May,2003), The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2003 and handsearched 8 related Chinese journals. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing PPC versus placebo/no treatment for chronic hepatitis were included with no restrictions of blinding, language and publication. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction and assessed the quality. Data were entered and analyzed by RevMan 4.2 software supplied by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Six high quality trials involving 568 patients were included. Four studies involving 451 patients showed the clinical effective rate of PPC for chronic hepatitis was 52.5% while the control group was 35.7% with statistical difference [RR 1.81, 95% CI (1.41, 2.33), Z = 4.69, P < 0.00001]. A meta -analysis involving three studies with 100 patients showed PPC can statically improve histopathology of chronic hepatitis comparing with control group [RR 2.58, 95% CI (1.61, 4.15), Z = 3.91, P < 0.0001]. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: PPC is a safe medicine used for treating chronic viral hepatitis and may relieve clinical symptoms and signs. At the same time, it has positive effect on hepatic histopathology for patients. However, more high quality clinical trials are required.

23244449231	The protective effects of Radix Astragali and Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong on endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria	Objective: To evaluate the effects of traditional Chinese complex prescription of Radix Astragali and Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and vascular endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. Methods: Twenty-one type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria were involved in this before-after study by individual informed consent. Each of the eligible subjects was given the decoction of Radix Astragali and Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong per os 150 ml q. d. for six months. The following examinations were performed at baseline and after treatment: (1) high-resolution ultrasonography to measure the diameter changes of brachial artery in response to reactive hyperemia (endothelium-dependent) and on administration of glyceryl trinitrate (endothelium-independent); (2) high resolution ultrasonography to measure combined intima-media thickness (IMT) of common carotid arteries (CCA); (3) fasting plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity, C reactive protein(CRP) and malonic aldehyde (MDA) concentration. Results: The patients had impaired endothelial dependent vasodilation (EDV) , elevated plasma PAI-1 activity and increased CRP and MDA concentration at baseline. After six months treatment with Radix Astragali and Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong, their urinary albumin-to- creatinine ratio decreased from (86.5 ± 53.9) μg/mg to (55.05 ± 51.67) μg/mg (P = 0.002). The EDV was improved at the end of the treatment (baseline: 7.49 ± 2.98%, after treatment: 12.73 ± 5.36%, P = 0.001). Meanwhile, the activity of PAI-1 and the levels of MDA and CRP were significantly decreased [PAI-1: (83.49 ± 5.11) × 10

24044554866	Automatic segmentation of echocardiography based on a morphological reconstruction algorithm	To improve the precision of the traditional segmentation of echocardiogram, by suppressing the influence from inherent speckle noises in medical ultrasonic images. An automatic segmentation method based on reconstructed morphology was proposed in this paper. First, the opening and closing operations by reconstruction were imposed to the ultrasonic image. Second, the top-hat operation was used to extract the bright and/or dark features and to find out the boundaries corresponding to these features, whereby implemented the automatic segmentation. The segmented echocardiogram had less artificial boundaries resulted from speckle noise, and could accurately be extracted the artery and ventricle. The presented method can detect both dark and bright objects accurately, and the boundary has a fine continuity. In addition, the algorithm is also applicable to the extraction of sole bright/dark features, accordingly to reduce the complexity and time needed and to improve the accuracy.

29144461971	The roles of protein kinase C in HIV replication and drugs discovery	Protein kinase C (PKC) belongs to the family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinase. PKC signaling has been implicated in the development of multiple human diseases including the central nervous system dysfunctions and cardiovascular disorders. It has been demonstrated that PKC can stimulate viral activation through multiple mechanisms and phosphorylate the HIV-1 p17 gag, Nef, Vif and Rev proteins as well. The phosphorylation of these proteins may have significant effects on HIV replication. Members of the PKC family participate at many levels in diverse signal transduction pathways involved in HIV cycles. PKC inhibition may be considered a logical mechanism which inhibits HIV-1 replication. Agents that induce HIV-1 replication could be used in conjunction with HAART to decrease or eliminate the latent reservoirs by forcing viral expression. A better understanding of the role of PKC could in form the search of specific target for new anti-HIV therapies.

Methods: A recombinant adenovirus vector carrying HIF-1α (Adv-HIF-1α) gene was constructed. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were set up in rats, and the rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group, ischemia reperfusion (IR) group. Adv-HIF-1α gene group and recombinant adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) group (Adv group). In addition to sham group, the other 3 groups were injected phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Adv-HIF-1α and Adv into ischemia ventricle after MCAO model, respectively. The expression of GFP was observed. Its cerebral infarct volume on focal cerebral ischemia was evaluated by 2,3,5-trihenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of the frontally sectioned brain removed at 72 h. Results: The expression of GFP was visualized only in the choroids plexus, ependymal cells and cells surrounding ventricular region in both hemispheres from 1 to 14 day after application Adv. In rats of the treatment group, the infarct volume was significantly smaller after application Adv- HIF-1α gene compared with IR group, Adv group, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Adv-HIF-1α gene transfer reduce cerebral infarct volume after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Adv-HIF-1α gene transfer has potential for treating ischemia stroke.

31544479819	On the role of liver-enriched transcription factors in regulating HBV transcription and replication	Objective: To Investigate the effects of various liver-enriched transcription factors in regulating HBV transcription and replication, and to explore their potential roles in HBV hepatotropism. Methods: The replication-competent HBV recombinant plasmid pHBV4. 1 plus different liver-enriched transcription factor (HNF1, HNF3, HNF4, HNF6, C/EBP and RXRα/PPARα) expression plasmids were co-transfected into nonhepatic cell lines (NIH3T3, HeLa, 293T, SW1353, CV-1 and COS1). The transcription levels of 3.5 kb, 2. 4/2. 1 kb and 0.7 kb HBV RNA were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization, and the level of HBV DNA replication intermediates was detected by Southern blot hybridization analysis. Results: In the absence of co-transfected liver enriched transcription factor expression vectors, the 3.5 kb HBV RNA is not transcribed and HBV DNA replication is not detected after transfecting of NIH 3T3 cells with pHBV4. 1. Expression of the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF4 or RXRα/PPARα, stimulates the transcription of 3.5 kb HBV RNA and the replication of HBV DNA. In contrast, expression of HNF1, HNF3, HNF6 and C/EBP does not stimulate the transcription of 3.5 kb HBV RNA and therefore does not activate viral replication. HNF4 and RXRα/PPARα were also shown to activate the transcription of 3.5 kb HBV RNA and viral replication in divers cell types including HeLa, 293T, SW1353, CV-1 and COS1 cells. Mutation of the proximal nucleocapsid HNF4 binding site results in a greatly decreased level of HNF4 or RXRα/PPARα dependent HBV replication. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF4 and RXRα/PPARα can support HBV transcription and replication in nonhepatic cells, indicating that liver-specific gene transcription is one of the determinants of HBV hepatotropism.

33746669356	Establishment of a highly sensitive chemiluminescent detection system for analysis of hepatitis B virus transcription and replication level in vitro	AIM: To establish a stable and highly sensitive chemiluminescent detection system for analysis of hepatitis V virus (HBV) transcription and replication level in vitro. METHODS: Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and HepG2.2.15, a HepG2 cell line with HBV transcription and replication, were collected after being cultured for 3 d and then divided equally. Total RNA of the cells and HBV replication intermediates were extracted and analyzed by Northern and Southern blot hybridization, respectively, while digoxigenin labeled HBV recombinant plasmid pHBV4.1 was used as the probe of the hybridizations. The results of the hybridizations were detected by chemiluminescent detection system. Thereafter pHBV4.1 was diluted into a series of multi-stage differential log-rank concentrations, and analyzed by dot blot hybridization along with Northern and Southern blot hybridization, which were used as the internal controls. RESULTS: High levels of HBV specific transcripts (3.5 kb and 2.4/2.1 kb mRNA) and HBV replication intermediate DNAs were detected by Northern and Southern hybridization analysis, respectively, in the HepG2.2.15 cells. No HBV specific transcripts or HBV replication intermediate DNAs were found in the HepG2 cells. Positive dot signals detected in the internal controls were weakened as the decrease of pHBV4.1 concentration. The sensitivity of the chemiluminescent detection system of the Northern and Southern hybridization analysis was 1 pg of the target nucleotides according to the internal controls, which was almost equal to that of isotope detection system. Similar results were obtained after the whole procedures were repeated for more than three times. CONCLUSION: A stable and highly sensitive chemiluminescent detection system for analysis of HBV transcription and replication level in vitro is successfully established.

33747833200	Evaluation of eccentric mitral regurgitation using a modified PISA algorithm	The PISA (Proximal Isovelocity Surface Area) method based on the foundation of the Doppler color proximal flow convergence, has been accepted by clinic to assess the severity of the central MR (mitral regurgitation). However, the result tend to be greatly underestimated when the PISA is applied to eccentric MR. In order to estimate eccentric MR, two parameters named turbulent intensity and regurgitate angle were proposed to modify the effective regurgitate orifice area (EROA) based on traditional PISA algorithm. 23 patients with various severity of eccentric MR were studied to compare modified PISA algorithm with the traditional one. The results showed the grading results of eccentric MR evaluated by the modified PISA algorithm were more rational and accurate, compared with the results obtained from live-3D color Doppler flow imaging method.

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of HNF-4α and HNF-3β in human tissues of liver, brain, lung, kidney, heart, spleen, intestine, pancreas, stomach and thyroid from 14 corpses. The differences of their expression in different tissues were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression patterns of HNF-4α and HNF-3β was different among the 10 kinds of human tissues (HNF-4α: F = 22.479, P < 0.01; HNF-3β: F = 13.021, P < 0.01). Both HNF-4α and HNF-3β expression were not detected in brain, lung, stomach, appendix, thymus, adrenal gland and tonsil. Besides the tissues mentioned above, the expression of HNF-4α was significantly higher in liver, kidney, heart, spleen and intestines than that in the other tissues; the expression of HNF-3β was markedly higher in liver, kidney, heart and pancreas than that in the other tissues. The difference between high-level expression and low-level expression group has statistical significance (P < 0.05); however, the difference among those tissues with high-level expression had no statistical significance (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of HNF-4α and HNF-3β are different among human tissues, and they are highly expressed in some tissues such as liver. This result indicates that HNF-4α and HNF-3β might participate in the tissue-specific replication of HBV.

34547136934	Regulation of hepatitis B virus transcription and replication by liver-enriched transcriptional factors	Hepatotropism is a prominent feature of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Cell lines of nonhepatic origin do not independently support HBV replication. In this review, we show that the nuclear hormone receptors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 and retinoid X receptor plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, support HBV replication in nonhepatic cells by controlling pregenomic RNA synthesis, indicating that these liver-enriched transcription factors control a unique molecular switch restricting viral tropism. In contrast, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 antagonizes nuclear hormone receptor-mediated viral replication, demonstrating distinct regulatory roles for these liver-enriched transcription factors.

34547432010	Immunoprotection role of a hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine responsible to BALB/c mice	Objective To investigate the specific immune response and the Immunoprotection effects of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), which is induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA vaccine pCMV-S2S, on BALB/c mouse with the attack of SP2/0-S2S cells, a BALB/c mouse myeloma cell line stably expressing the HBV preS2S antigen. Methods BALB/c mice were divided into 3 groups: experimental group (intramuscularly injected with pCMV-S2S), control group 1 (HBsAg vaccine immunizing) or control group 2 (plasmid pCMV immunizing), which were immunized thrice at week 0,4 and 8 respectively. Specific CTL activities of 3 mice of each group were measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays, 4w after the last boost. The other mice of each group were subcutaneously inoculated with SP2/0-S2S cells into one lateral of flanks. SP2/0-CMV cell without expressing preS2S was subcutaneously inoculated into another lateral of mouse flanks. The time of visible tumor formation and the size of tumor were recorded and observed. The life span and survival rate of mice after loaded with the tumor cells were analyzed by Log-Rank statistics and Kaplan-Meier Survival curve respectively. Results The specific CTL lysis value of pCMV-S2S group mice was (34.21 ± 1.38)%, higher than that of HBsAg group [(19.64 ± 1.50)%] or pCMV group [(3.45 ± 1.89)%D (P<0.05). The visible SP2/0-S2S tumor formation rate in pCMV-S2S group mice was 58. 3% lower than that in the pCMV group (91.7%), 10 d after inoculated with the tumor cells (P<0.05). The tumor formation rates of the two control groups were no obvious difference. The date of the first mouse dying in pCMV-S2S group was 24d, delayed for 13d, compared with that in the two control groups. The average life span of pCMV-S2S group mice after loaded with the tumor cells was (31±1) d, longer than that of the two control groups (P<0.05). The 4w survival rate of the pCMV-S2S group mice was obviously increased (75%), compared with the two control groups (P<0.05). The average life span and the 4w survival rate of the two control group mice were no obvious difference. Conclusion The hepatitis B virus DNA pCMV-S2S vaccination may elicit substantial HBV preS2S-specific CTL response in vivo, which gives the mouse the immunoprotection against the attack of SP2/0-S2S cells. The results indicate that pCMV-S2S may be used to the immunoprotection from HBV infection.

35248878653	Establishment and primary application of a mouse model with hepatitis B virus replication	Aim: To establish a rapid and convenient animal model with hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Methods: A naked DNA solution . of HBV-replication-competent plasmid was transferred to BALB/C mice via the tail vein, using a hydrodynamic in vivo transfection procedure. After injection, these mice were sacrificed on d 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. HBV DNA replication intermediates in the liver were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. The expression of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the liver was checked by immunohistochemistry. Serum HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Inhibition of HBV replication was compared in HBV replication model mice treated intraperitoneally with polyinosinic-polytidylin acid (polyIC) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Results: After hydrodynamic in vivo transfection, HBV DNA replication intermediates in the mouse liver were detectable on d 1 and abundant on d 3 and 4, the levels were slightly decreased and remained relatively stable between d 5 and 7, and were almost undetectable on d 10. The expression patterns of HBcAg and HBsAg were similar to that of HBV replication intermediate DNA, except that they reached a peak on d 1 after injection. No obvious differences in HBV DNA replication intermediates were observed in the left, right and middle lobes of the liver. After treatment with polyIC, the level of HBV intermediate DNA in the liver was lower than that in the control mice injected with PBS. Conclusion: A rapid and convenient mouse model with a high level of HBV replication was developed and used to investigate the inhibitory effect of polyIC on HBV replication, which provides a useful tool for future functional studies of the HBV genome. © 2007 WJG.

Methods Clinical data of 68 patients with S. suis 2 infection were retrieved retrospectively. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical symtom or/and isolation of S. suis 2 from the infected sites in Shichuan province in the summer of 2005. The patients ranged from general type (simple sepsis) to septic shock type, meningitis type and mixed type. Results The outbreak of S. suis 2 infection occurred in June to August in 2005. The common source of infection came from pigs. The people in great risks were farmers who exposed to sick or dead pigs with 5. suis 2 infection. Most infection occurred on the people who slaughtered infected pigs, followed by those who dressed infected meats. The prominent symptoms included fever with sharp chills, dizziness, headache, malaise and myalgia. Some patients had abdominal pain and diarrhea. Septic shock and coma often occurred in severe cases. According to the clinical manifestations, patients were categorized into four different clinical types: general type, septic shock type, meningitis type, and mixed type. S. suis 2 isolated from the patients were susceptible to most antimicrobial agents, except for tetracycline. All of the patients were treated with β-lactam antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins). Some were given combined antimicrobial agents. Seventy seven percent (52/68) of patients survived. All of the general patients recovered completely. Fifty eight percent (15/26) of patients with septic shock died. The artificial ventilation and persistent blood filtering treatment played an important role for treating patients with septic shock. Although most patients with meningitis (97. 5%) survived, a decrease in hearing or even hearing loss occurred to some of the survivors. Conclusion Purulent meningitis and septic shock are the major clinical manifestations for 5. suis 2 infection in human. The treatment for patients with meningitis is more effective than that for patients with septic shock.

Here, the core region of the human CIDE-A promoter was characterized. Surprisingly, two Sp1/Sp3-binding sites, rather than tissue-specific transcription factors, were found to be required for the promoter activity. Although the ubiquitously expressed Sp1 and Sp3 were crucial, they alone could not adequately regulate the specific expression of CIDE-A. We found that the expression of CIDE-A was further regulated by CpG methylation of the promoter region. By performing bisulfite sequencing, we observed dense CpG methylation of the promoter region in tissues and cells with low or no expression of CIDE-A but not in tissues with high level of CIDE-A expression. In vitro methylation of this region showed significantly reduced transcriptional activity. Treatment of CIDE-A -negative cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine demethylated the CpG sites; this opened the closed chromatin conformation and markedly enhanced the binding affinity of Sp1/Sp3 to the promoter in vivo, thereby restoring CIDE-A expression. These data indicated that CpG methylation plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining tissue- and cell-specific transcription of the CIDE-A gene through the regulation of Sp1/Sp3 binding. © 2007 The Author(s).

58949098335	Hepatitis B virus X protein sensitizes cells to starvation-induced autophagy via up-regulation of beclin 1 expression	Human beclin 1 is the first identified mammalian gene to induce autophagy. It is commonly expressed at reduced levels in breast tumors; however, it is overexpressed in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected cancerous liver tissues. To expose the possible mechanism and biological significance of this up-regulation of beclin 1, we investigated the regulation of beclin 1 expression by HBV x protein (HBx) in hepatic or hepatoma cell lines. Here, we showed that enforced expression of HBx by transfection technology results in the up-regulation of the endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of Beclin 1 in the tested cells. Using a luciferase- reporter assay, we demonstrated that HBx transactivates beclin 1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. The promoter region of the beclin 1 gene identified in this study is located at -277/+197 and has the maximum transcriptional activity. HBx-mediated up-regulation of beclin 1 expression might be direct, that is, via its promoter. Furthermore, the cells that transiently or stably expressed HBx showed an enhanced accumulation of vacuoles carrying the autophagy marker LC3 as compared with the control cells, which was induced by nutrient starvation, indicating HBx-enhanced autophagy. Moreover, this enhanced autophagy occurred in HepG2.2.15 cells that replicate HBV and in cells transfected with HBV genomic DNA, suggesting that HBV infection also causes increased levels of autophagy under starvation conditions. Treatment of cells with beclin 1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked HBx-enhanced autophagy, demonstrating that the function of HBx in influencing autophagy is Beclin 1 dependent. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a novel function of HBx in increasing autophagy through the up-regulation of beclin1 expression, and this may provide an important mechanism in HBV-infected hepatocytes growing under nutrient-deficient conditions.

79951545532	Blocking NF-κB and Akt by Hsp90 inhibition sensitizes Smac mimetic compound 3-induced extrinsic apoptosis pathway and results in synergistic cancer cell death	NF-κB and Akt are two main cell survival pathways that attenuate the anticancer efficacy of therapeutics. Our previous studies demonstrated that the Smac mimetic compound 3 (SMC3) specifically suppresses c-IAP1 and induces TNF-α autocrine to kill cancer cells. However, SMC3 also induces a cell survival signal through NF-κB activation. In this report, we further found that SMC3 potently activates Akt, which inhibits SMC3-induced cancer cell death. Strikingly, concurrent blocking NF-κB and Akt resulted in a significantly potentiated cytotoxicity. Because heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of both the NF-κB and Akt pathways in cancer cells, we examined if suppression of Hsp90 is able to potentiate SMC3-induced cancer cell death. The results show that targeting Hsp90 does not interfere with SMC3-induced c-IAP1 degradation and TNF-α autocrine, the key processes for SMC3-induced cancer cell apoptosis. However, Hsp90 inhibitors effectively blocked SMC3-induced NF-κB activation through degradation of RIP1 and IKKβ, two key components of the NF-κB activation pathway, and reduced both the constitutive and SMC3-induced Akt activity through degradation of the Akt protein. Consistently, with the co-treatment of SMC3 and Hsp90 inhibitors, apoptosis was markedly sensitized and a synergistic cytotoxicity was observed. The results suggest that concurrent targeting c-IAP1 and Hsp90 by combination of SMC3 and Hsp90 inhibitors is an effective approach for improving the anticancer value of SMC3. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79951958514	Overexpression of GPR39 contributes to malignant development of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: By using cDNA microarray analysis, we identified a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR39, that is significantly up-regulated in ESCC. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of GPR39 in human esophageal cancer development, and to examine the prevalence and clinical significance of GPR39 overexpression in ESCC.Methods: The mRNA expression level of GPR39 was analyzed in 9 ESCC cell lines and 50 primary ESCC tumors using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess GPR39 protein expression in tissue arrays containing 300 primary ESCC cases. In vitro and in vivo studies were done to elucidate the tumorigenic role of GPR39 in ESCC cells.Results: We found that GPR39 was frequently overexpressed in primary ESCCs in both mRNA level (27/50, 54%) and protein level (121/207, 58.5%), which was significantly associated with the lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage (P < 0.01). Functional studies showed that GPR39 has a strong tumorigenic ability. Introduction of GPR39 gene into ESCC cell line KYSE30 could promote cell proliferation, increase foci formation, colony formation in soft agar, and tumor formation in nude mice. The mechanism by which amplified GPR39 induces tumorigenesis was associated with its role in promoting G1/S transition via up-regulation of cyclin D1 and CDK6. Further study found GPR39 could enhance cell motility and invasiveness by inducing EMT and remodeling cytoskeleton. Moreover, depletion of endogenous GPR39 by siRNA could effectively decrease the oncogenicity of ESCC cells.Conclusions: The present study suggests that GPR39 plays an important tumorigenic role in the development and progression of ESCC. © 2011 Xie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84861827479	The role of femA regulating gene on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates	Objective: The authors investigated the role of . femA regulating gene on methicillin-resistant . Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: High-level MRSA, low-level MRSA, and methicillin-susceptible . Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were determined by agar diffusion methods. β-lactamase was then detected by nitrocefin and the presence of mecA was determined by PCR. Only β-lactamase-negative but mecA-positive isolates were included in further studies. The . femA gene and its 250. bp upstream sequence were amplified by PCR. Expression levels of . femA were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. The 250. bp upstream sequence of . femA was labeled by BrightStar Psoralen-Biotin and was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results: The expression levels of . femA in the three different groups (MSSA, low-level MRSA, and high-level MRSA) ranged from 3.53. ×. 10-3% to 29.91%, 5.54. ×. 10-3% to 3.1. ×. 102%, and 13.88% to 5.50. ×. 104%, respectively. EMSA could detect the signal shift in 55 high-level MRSA isolates but not in four low-level MRSA and four MSSA strains. Conclusion: The expression levels of . femA in high-level MRSA (non-β-lactamase-producing) were higher than in low-level MRSA and MSSA. The . femA regulating gene probably lies in the 250. bp upstream sequence in MRSA. High-level expression of . femA seems to be essential for high-level MRSA. © 2008 .

84877136180	An integrated proteomics and bioinformatics analyses of hepatitis B virus X interacting proteins and identification of a novel interactor apoA-I	HBx is well-known to be a multifunctional protein encoded by HBV and its biological functions are mainly dependent on pleiotropic protein-protein interactions (PPIs); however, the global mapping of HBx-interactome has not been established so far. Thus, in this study, we have identified 127 HBx-interacting proteins by a profound GST pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry, and constructed an HBx-interactome network and core apoA-I pathways with a series of bioinformatics approaches. One of the identified HBx-binding partners is apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which has a specific role in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. The HBx-apoA-I protein interaction was confirmed by both GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation. The ectopic overexpression of apoA-I can lead to a significant inhibition on HBV secretion concomitant with the reduction of cellular cholesterol level. In addition, HBV can modulate the function of apoA-I through HBx which might interact with the 44-189 residues of apoA-I and result in dysfunction of apoA-I such as decreased self-association ability, increased carbonyl level and impaired lipid-binding ability. Our results demonstrate an integrated physical association of HBx and host proteins, especially a novel interactor apoA-I that may influence the HBV secretion, which would shed new light on exploring the complicated mechanisms of HBV manipulation on host cellular functions. Biological significance: HBx is well-known to be a multifunctional protein encoded by HBV and its biological functions are mainly dependent on pleiotropic protein-protein interactions. Although a series of HBx-interacting proteins have been identified, a global characterization of HBx interactome has not been reported. In this study, we have identified a total of 127 HBx-interacting proteins by a profound GST pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry, and constructed an HBx-interactome network with a series of bioinformatics approaches. Our results demonstrate an integrated physical association of HBx and host proteins which may help us explore the complicated mechanisms of HBV manipulation on host cellular functions. In addition, we validated one of the identified HBx-binding partners, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which played a significant inhibitory effect on HBV secretion, indicating a crucial role of the HBx-apoA-I axis in HBV life cycle. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84897653506	Distribution and clinical correlates of viral and host genotypes in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection	Background and Aim: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is relatively frequent in China. This study investigated the clinical, demographic, and viral and host genetic characteristics that may influence disease manifestations and clinical management. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, treatment-naïve Han ethnic adults with recently confirmed chronic HCV infection were enrolled at 28 hospitals across China. HCV genotype and host interleukin 28B (IL28B) genotypes were determined and compared with patient demographic parameters and medical status. Results: Among the 997 HCV-positive patients analyzed, 56.8% were infected with HCV genotype 1b, followed in prevalence by genotypes 2, 3, and 6, with substantial regional variation. Overall, 84.1% of patients were IL28B genotype CC (rs12979860), with little regional variation. Cirrhosis was reported in 10.1% of patients and was significantly associated with hepatitis B virus coinfection, low HCV viral load, low serum alanine aminotransferase, high serum aspartate aminotransferase, diabetes, and high pickled food consumption. Medical procedures were common transmission risk factors; however, lifestyle-associated risk factors, including intravenous drug abuse and tattoos or piercings, were more common in patients with HCV genotype 3 or 6. Conclusions: Most HCV-infected Han Chinese patients were IL28B genotype CC (rs12979860). HCV genotypes varied by geographic region, and disease characteristics differed according to HCV genotype. Relatively frequent detection of advanced liver disease may reflect limitations on access to antiviral therapy, and suggests that greater awareness of factors that influence HCV-associated disease may help avoid clinical complications and improve patient outcomes. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

4344586161	Three-dimensional reconstruction of mitral regurgitation velocity modality from color doppler flow images	Advances in echocardiographic systems and computer applications have made three dimensional reconstruction of anatomical structures possible which open a new and fascinating field of color Doppler flow image, but the spatial shape and quantitative evaluation of mitral regurgitation is often difficult in the clinical setting. In this paper, we present a method to complete the 3D reconstruction of the mitral regurgitation, mitral regurgitation information was first derived from color Doppler flow images, and then the mitral regurgitation velocity values was mapped according to the color bar in the images. With the proper method of interpolation and rendering, the experiment result of 3D visualization of mitral regurgitation is satisfying. Measurements from a 3D reconstructed flow convergence region may be superior to measurements from 2D color Doppler recordings to calculate volume flow, 3D mitral regurgitation reconstruction is possible and opens new possibilities in flow quantification, Further study of the method may be very helpful in the diagnosis of heart diseases.

44649161902	Proteomic analysis of cellular protein alterations using a hepatitis B virus-producing cellular model	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major etiological factors responsible for acute and chronic liver disease and for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To determine the effects of HBV replication on host cell-protein expression, we utilized 2-DE and MS/MS analysis to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins between an HBV-producing cell line HepG2.2.15 and its parental cell line HepG2. Of the 66 spots identified as differentially expressed (± over twofold, p <0.05) between the two cell lines, 62 spots (corresponding to 61 unique proteins) were positively identified by MS/MS analysis. These proteins could be clearly divided into three major groups by cluster and metabolic/signaling pathway analysis: proteins involved in retinol metabolism pathway, calcium ion-binding proteins, and proteins associated with protein degradation pathways. Other proteins identified include those that function in diverse biological processes such as signal transduction, immune regulation, molecular chaperone, electron transport/redox regulation, cell proliferation/differentiation, and mRNA splicing. In summary, we profiled proteome alterations between HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 cells. The proteins identified in this study would be useful in revealing the mechanisms underlying HBV-host cell interactions and the development of HCC. This study can also provide some useful clues for antiviral research. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

45149126673	Combination pharmacological cardioversion of permanent atrial fibrillation in post-prosthetic mitral valve replacement outpatients: A novel approach for the treatment of atrial fibrillation	This study explored the efficacy and safety of combination pharmacological cardioversion of permanent atrial fibrillation in outpatients following prosthetic mitral valve replacement. The study group comprised 99 outpatients who were randomly divided into two groups. In group 1 (n = 50), only ventricular heart rate was controlled. In group 2 (n = 49), combination pharmacological cardioversion therapy with low-dose oral amiodarone (2 mg/kg), captopril (0.25 mg/kg) and simvastatin (0.3 mg/kg) was administered daily. During 12 months of serial pharmacological treatment, the cardioversion rate was 6% for group 1 and 39% for group 2; the likelihood of cardioversion differed significantly between the two groups. In group 2, one patient developed severe pruritus that necessitated withdrawal from the study and six patients ceased captopril treatment after contracting a persistent cough. In summary, combination pharmacological cardioversion was found to be effective and safe in outpatients who had undergone prosthetic mitral valve replacement.

47049107630	Perventricular Device Closure of Ventricular Septal Defects: Six Months Results in 30 Young Children	Background: Both surgical repair and transcatheter closure of isolated ventricular septal defects are known to have limitations in children. This report describes the short-term results of perventricular device closure of nonmuscular ventricular septal defects without cardiopulmonary bypass in young children. Methods: Thirty patients who had nonmuscular ventricular septal defects underwent perventricular closure by minimally invasive technique without cardiopulmonary bypass. A subxiphoid minimally invasive incision was performed. Under the continuous guidance of transesophageal echocardiography, the free wall of the right ventricle was punctured and a guidewire was introduced into the left ventricle through the defect. A delivery sheath was advanced over the wire and through the defect into the left ventricle. The device was released. Results: Closure was successful in 27 patients (90%). There was no mortality or atrioventricular block perioperatively or during the entire follow-up period. Three patients developed incomplete right bundle branch blocks and seven patients developed new trace or mild tricuspid regurgitation after the closure. The mean hospital stay was 3.6 ± 0.7 days (range, 3 to 5 days) and no patient needed any blood or blood products. Follow-up at 6 months showed that two of the three patients had persistent incomplete right bundle branch block and three of the seven patients had persistent closure-related trace or mild tricuspid regurgitation. Conclusions: Perventricular device closure of isolated ventricular septal defects without cardiopulmonary bypass appeared to be safe and efficacious in selected young children. The outcomes of short-term follow-up are acceptable. © 2008 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

45549099659	Clinical application and research progress in hepatitis B virus quasispecies	The phenomenon of quasispecies commonly exists in RNA virus. Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a kind of DNA virus, it has the same phenomenon. Moreover, every coding area of HBV has the characteristic of quasispecies. HBV exists and distributes in the form of quasispecies in hosts. The variation is closely related to the evolution of quasispecies. The diversity of variation is not only the fundamental reason for the generation of quasispecies, but also the initial factor of unceasing change in quasispecies, and the diversity and complexity of variation indicate those of quasispecies. The evolution of HBV quasispecies determines the patients' clinical manifestation and treatment response to antivirus drugs, and especially there is a close relationship between the composing of quasispecies and the resistance to antivirus drugs. The introduction of quasispecies can help us study HBV from the integral and dynamic angle and make a more reasonable prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HBV infection.

48149095378	Quantification of eccentric mitral regurgitation by regurgitant volume	To investigate and verify that real-time 3-dimensional (RT-3D) color Doppler is capable of quantifying the eccentric mirai regurgitation (MR) by computing regurgitant volume (RV). 34 patients (mean age 37.13±18.28 years) with confirmed eccentric MR were undergone RT-3D echocardiography. By the spatial and temporal integration of the cross-sectional velocity distribution of regurgitant valve, the systolic RV can be evaluated. Then RV were applied to assessing the severity of eccentric MR and compared with the jet volume (JV) and the vena contracta width (VCW) immediately measured. In 34 patients, 2 patients were graded as mild, 16 patients as moderate, and 16 patients as severe. Our RV measurements have good correlation with JV(r=0.9453) and VCW(r=0.8829) respectively. RT-3D color Doppler echocardiography was capable of quantifying the RV of the eccentric MR. © 2007 IEEE.

49749086116	Recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor for liver failure	The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (rh-HGF) for liver failure (LF) using meta-analysis of data from the literature involving available randomized controlled trials of rh-HGF plus comprehensive therapy (CT) compared with that of CT alone (Therapy I versus II) in treating LF. We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CBMdisc, and CNKI as well as employing manual searches. Based on our search criteria, we found 21 trials, involving 5902 patients. Our results showed that Therapy I, compared with therapy II, significantly reduced the overall mortality (RR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.59-0.66; p = 0.0001). Compared to two clinical types of LF (acute and acute-on-chronic), therapy I perhaps had significant effect on mortality due to sub-acute LF, RR and 95% CI were 0.76 [0.65, 0.89], 0.66 [0.60, 0.74], and 0.58 [0.53, 0.64], respectively. Additionally, there was a reduction in mortality of patients that had evidence for an early stage of LF compared to the two other clinical stages of LF (Middle and Advanced); RR and 95% CI were 0.34 [0.24, 0.49], 0.49 [0.44, 0.55], and 0.87 [0.82, 0.93], respectively. No serious adverse events were reported. We conclude that Therapy I may reduce mortality in LF, especially in sub-acute LF and the early stage of LF. However, considering the strength of the evidence, additional randomized controlled trials are needed before Therapy I can be recommended routinely. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

54249140427	Change of liver histology in chronic hepatitis B patients with alanine aminotransferase less than two-time up limits of normal	AIM: To analyze the change of hepatic histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection whose alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is lower than two-time up limit of normal (ULN) and discuss the factors affecting the change of liver histology. METHODS: According to ALT ≤ 0.5 x ULN, 0.5 x ULN < ALT ≤ 1 x ULN and 1 x ULN < ALT < 2 x ULN, 170 patients were divided into group I (n = 39), group II (n = 87) and group III (n = 44). We retrospectively analyzed whether the change of liver histology was related to ALT level, HbeAg status, HBV DNA duplication and the age of patients. RESULTS: The rates of grade 2 or 2+ inflammation in group I, II and III were 43.6%, 56.4% and 65.9%, respectively, and the rates of stage 2 or 2+ fibrosis were 38.4%, 48.3% and 61.3%, respectively. There were 5.1%, 8.1% and 18.2% patients with liver cirrhosis (stage 4) in the three groups. The activity of liver inflammation and degree of fibrosis were related to ALT level (F = 4.162, 3.992; both P < 0.05) and the age of patients (F = 32.831, 20.084; both P < 0.05), while the degree of liver fibrosis was related with HbeAg positive rate (χ

60249084993	Inhibitory effect of HMGN2 protein on human hepatitis B virus expression and replication in the HepG2.2.15 cell line	Natural killer (NK) cells and cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been implicated as important effectors of antiviral defense. We previously isolated a novel antibacterial polypeptide, which was identified as high mobility group nucleosomal-binding domain 2 (HMGN2), from human mononuclear leukocytes. This study examined the antiviral activity of HMGN2 against human hepatitis virus B. HMGN2 was isolated and purified from the acid soluble proteins of the human THP-1 cell line, and identified by mass spectrum, Western blot and antibacterial assay. The hepatitis B virus (HBV)-transfected HepG2.2.15 cell line was used in the in vitro assay system. In the range of 1-100 μg/ml HMGN2, no cytotoxicity for HepG2.2.15 cells was detected by MTT assay. When incubated with HMGN2 at 1-100 μg/ml for 72 or 144 h, there was a significant reduction in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression, which were detected by ELISA, and a significant reduction in HBV DNA copies, which was determined by the real time quantitative PCR, in the supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells. Northern and Southern blot analysis also showed that the levels of the HBV 3.5 kb and the 2.4/2.1 kb mRNA species and HBV replicative intermediate DNA were significantly reduced in the HMGN2-treated HepG2.2.15 cells. These results indicated that HMGN2 protein could markedly inhibit HBV protein expression and replication in vitro. Crown Copyright © 2008.

61849154030	Proteomic profiling identifies aberrant epigenetic modifications induced by hepatitis B virus X protein	The hepatitis B virus-encoded X (HBx) protein coactivates transcription of a variety of viral and cellular genes and it is believed to play essential roles in viral replication and hepatocarcinogenesis. To examine the pleiotropic effects of HBx protein on host cell protein expression, we utilized 2-DE and MS analysis to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins between a stable HBx-transfected cell line (HepG2-HBx), constitutively expressing HBx, and vector control cells. Of the 60 spots identified as differentially expressed (± over 2-fold, p < 0.05) between the two cell lines, 54 spots were positively identified by MS/MS analysis. Several recent studies suggested that HBx was involved in regional hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and global hypomethylation of satellite 2 repeats during hepatocarcinogenesis; however, no specific gene has been reported as hypomethylated by HBx. Promoter methylation analysis was examined for those protein spots showing significant alterations, and our results revealed that specific genes, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), can be hypomethylated by HBx, and two calcium ion-binding proteins, S100A6 and S100A4, were hyperm-ethylated by HBx and could be re-expressed by AZA (DNA methylase inhibitor) treatment. Moreover, via cluster and pathway analysis, we proposed a hypothetical model for the HBx regulatory circuit involving aberrant methylation of retinol metabolism-related genes and calcium homeostasis-related genes. In summary, we profiled proteome alterations between HepG2-HBx and control cells, and found that HBx not only induces regional hypermethylation but also specific hypomethylation of host cell genes. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

62849092966	Perventricular device closure of muscular ventricular septal defects on beating hearts: Initial experience in eight children	Objective: The conventional surgical repair and transcatheter closure of muscular ventricular septal defects are known to have undesirable limitations. This communication describes the short-term results of perventricular device closure of muscular ventricular septal defects with the heart beating in 8 children with 15 muscular ventricular septal defects, with or without other congenital malformations. Methods: A subxiphoid minimally invasive incision was used in 3 children with isolated muscular ventricular septal defects whereas standard full median sternotomies were used in the other 5 children who required subsequent correction of coexisting malformations. Under the continuous guidance of transesophageal echocardiography, the free wall of the right ventricle was punctured, and a guidewire was introduced into the left ventricle through the defect. A delivery sheath was advanced over the wire and through the defect into the left ventricle. The device was released. Results: A total of 14 muscular ventricular septal defects were successfully closed perventricularly without cardiopulmonary bypass. There was no mortality perioperatively or during the entire follow-up period. At 6-month follow-up, there was no detectable residual shunt, arrhythmia, or new mitral or tricuspid insufficiency. Other than 5 children with the coexisting malformations, none of the other children required any blood or blood products. The average hospital stay was 7.9 ± 2.2 days (range, 5-11 days). Conclusion: Perventricular device closure of muscular ventricular septal defects with or without coexisting congenital malformations appeared to be safe and efficacious. The outcomes of short-term follow-up are acceptable. © 2009 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

67649371458	IKKβ-mediated nuclear factor-κB activation attenuates smac mimetic-induced apoptosis in cancer cells	Smac mimetics (SM) have been recently reported to kill cancer cells through the extrinsic apoptosis pathway mediated by autocrine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). SM also activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). However, how SM induces NF-κB and the role of NF-κB in SM-induced cancer cell death has not been well elucidated. We found that effective blockage of NF-κB had no detectable effect on SM compound 3 (SMC3)-induced TNF secretion, suggesting that the induction of TNF by SMC3 is independent of NF-κB. Conversely, SMC3-induced NF-κB activation was found to be mediated by autocrine TNF because this effect of SMC3 was effectively inhibited when TNF was blocked with either a TNF neutralizing antibody or TNF small interfering RNA. In addition, although SMC3 dramatically reduced c-IAP1 level, it had marginal effect on c-IAP2 expression, TNF-induced RIP modification, NF-κB activation, and downstream antiapoptosis NF-κB target expression. Furthermore, blocking NF-κB by targeting IKKβ or RelA substantially potentiated SMC3-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that the NF-κB pathway inhibits SMC3-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Our results show that through TNF autocrine, SM induces an IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation pathway that protects cancer cells against SM-induced apoptosis, and thus, NF-κB blockage could be an effective approach for improving the anticancer value of SM.

67649920809	Treatment with lamivudine versus lamivudine and thymosin alpha-1 for e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B patients: A meta-analysis	Background. Currently, there is no evidence on the combination of lamivudine and thymosin alpha-1 on chronic hepatitis B patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of lamivudine monotherapy with that of lamivudine and thymosin alpha-1 combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive hepatitis B patients. Results. We searched PUBMED (from 1966 onwards), EMBASE (from 1966), CBMdisk (Chinese Biomedical Database, from 1978), CNKI (National Knowledge Infrastructure, from 1980), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Eight trials (583 patients in total) were identified. The lamivudine and thymosin alpha-1 combination treatment was significantly superior to lamivudine treatment in terms of ALT normalization rate (80.2% vs. 68.8%, P = 0.01), virological response rate (84.7% vs. 74.9%, P = 0.002), and HBeAg seroconversion rate (45.1% vs. 15.2%, P < 0.00001). Conclusion. Among HBeAg-positive patients, thymosin alpha-1 and lamivudine combination therapy may be more effective than lamivudine monotherapy, providing superior rates of biochemical response, virological response, and HBeAg seroconversion. © 2009 Zhang et al.

67651232714	Establishment of cell lines using a doxycycline-inducible gene expression system to regulate expression of hepatitis B virus X protein	The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene plays an important role in HBV-associated pathogenesis, especially hepatocarcinogenesis. Establishment of a stable and regulable HBx expression system will allow study of the function of this gene. Here, we describe the development of a doxycycline-inducible recombinant plasmid (pBPSTR3-FlagX) with the full-length HBV X gene and all components of the tetracycline-on ("Tet-on") gene expression system. This vector exhibited dose-dependent doxycycline-dependent induction of the Flag-HBx protein in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. We also observed dose-dependent doxycycline transactivation of HBx in HepG2 cells. After transfecting HepG2 cells with the pBPSTR3-FlagX plasmid, we isolated five puromycin-resistant cell clones with stable HBx expression, two of which exhibited stable and tight control of HBx expression by doxycycline. This new system has great potential for functional studies of the HBV X gene. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

67651241511	Gender and metabolic differences of gallstone diseases	Aim: To investigate the risk factors for gallstone disease in the general population of Chengdu, China. Methods: This study was conducted at the West China Hospital. Subjects who received a physical examination at this hospital between January and December 2007 were included. Body mass index, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, serum lipid and lipoproteins concentrations were analyzed. Gallstone disease was diagnosed by ultrasound or on the basis of a history of cholecystectomy because of gallstone disease. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors for gallstone disease, and the Chi-square test was used to analyze differences in the incidence of metabolic disorders between subjects with and without gallstone disease. Results: A total of 3573 people were included, 10.7% (384/3573) of whom had gallstone diseases. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the incidence of gallstone disease in subjects aged 40-64 or ≥ 65 years was significantly different from that in those aged 18-39 years (P < 0.05); the incidence was higher in women than in men (P < 0.05). In men, a high level of fasting plasma glucose was obvious in gallstone disease (P < 0.05), and in women, hypertriglyceridemia or obesity were significant in gallstone disease (P < 0.05). Conclusion: We assume that age and sex are profoundly associated with the incidence of gallstone disease; the metabolic risk factors for gallstone disease were different between men and women. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

68749088816	The correlation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha and 3 beta with hepatitis B virus replication in the liver of chronic hepatitis B patients	Hepatocyte nuclear factors 4 alpha (HNF4α) and 3 beta (HNF3β) are members of a group of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs) that play important roles in regulating the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Using cell culture and animal models, we showed that HNF4α supports HBV replication in nonhepatic cells and HNF3β inhibits HBV replication. However, the expression of HNF4α and HNF3β in the liver tissue of chronic HBV-infected patients and the relationship between the levels of HNF4α and HNF3β and HBV replication are unclear. In this study, liver biopsy specimens from 86 chronic HBV-infected patients were collected. The expression levels of HNF4α, HNF3β, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) were detected by an immunohistochemical technique and the level of HBV DNA was checked by in situ hybridization with serial sections from liver biopsy tissue samples. We show here that samples with higher levels of HNF4α expression also have higher levels of HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA. In contrast, in samples with higher levels of HNF3β expression, levels of HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA were lower. There was a positive correlation between HNF4α expression and HBV replication, and a negative correlation between HNF3β expression and HBV replication, in the liver of chronic HBV-infected patients. This suggests that HNF4α and HNF3β likely participate in HBV replication in patients with HBV infection, or that HBV replication may somehow influence the expression of HNF4α and HNF3β in the liver. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

69249195954	Prevalence and risk factors of fatty liver disease in Chengdu, Southwest China	BACKGROUND: Fatty liver disease (FLD) is increasingly recognized as one of the most common chronic liver diseases in China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of FLD in Chengdu, Southwest China, and to provide a relevant basis for the prevention and intervention of FLD. METHODS: Altogether 9094 subjects (4721 men and 4373 women) of over 18 years old who had received a medical checkup in the West China Hospital of Sichuan University between January and December 2007 were evaluated for FLD. FLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Body mass index (BMI), height, body weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TCh), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured using routine laboratory methods. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of FLD was 12.5%, which was more than 3-fold higher in males than in females (18.9% vs. 5.7%, χ

76849084491	Histological changes in chinese chronic hepatitis B patients with alt lower than two times upper limits of normal	The role of ALT as a predictor of liver injury has been questioned. The aim of this study is to use liver biopsy to assess the degree of liver injury in patients with chronic hepatitis B(CHB) whose ALT < 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN). A total of 49.2% of patients in this study had significant inflammation (grade ≥2) and 36.4% had significant fibrosis (stage ≥2). The frequency of serious inflammation and fibrosis was similar in patients with different ALT levels. The level of serum HBV DNA was not significantly associated with the extent of inflammation and fibrosis. Advanced age was a significant independent predictor of histological damage and the presence of more significant inflammation and fibrosis. We conclude that many CHB patients with ALT < 2 × ULN have significant liver inflammation or fibrosis and that liver biopsy is necessary to assess liver damage and should be used to assess the need for anti-viral therapy. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77749310198	Different structural remodelling in atrial fibrillation with different types of mitral valvular diseases	Aims The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between atrial structural remodelling and atrial fibrillation (AF) for different types of mitral valvular diseases (MVDs). Methods and results Left atrial appendages tissue samples were obtained from 24 patients with MVDs undergoing mitral valve replacement surgery. Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed to assess the extent of the fibrosis. Ultrastructural changes in left atrial appendages were examined by electron microscope. The degree of fibrosis showed significant increases in patients with AF compared with patients with sinus rhythm (SR) (P = 0.023). The collagen volume fraction (CVF) of fibrosis significantly increased in mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation (MS-AF) compared with the mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation (MR-AF) group (P = 0.043). Collagen Type I levels were significantly increased in AF patients with mitral stenosis compared with AF patients with mitral regurgitation (P = 0.043). Different CVF of Matrix metalloproteinases-2 was present between the MS-SR group and the MS-AF group (P = 0.001). Electron microscopy revealed normally structured sarcomeres with a predominance of loosely packed cardiomyocytes in samples from patients with SR. Fibrotic bands, which tended to separate individual cardiomyocytes, were apparent in samples from patients with AF. Conclusion Atrial structural remodelling is associated with AF patients with MVDs. Different heart rhythm statuses with different types of MVDs are associated with variable atrial structural remodelling. Different atrial structural remodelling is a mechanism that may contribute to the increased risk of AF with MVDs.

77949392835	Quantification of chronic aortic regurgitation by vector flow mapping: A novel echocardiographic method	Aims: Quantification of aortic regurgitation (AR) using echocardiography is challenging. A newly established echocardiographic method, vector flow mapping (VFM), can directly measure blood flow volume (FV) regardless of rheological characteristics. We intended to assess the accuracy of VFM in the quantification of chronic AR. Methods and results: Twenty-one patients with chronic AR, along with 21 healthy volunteers selected as controls, underwent conventional echocardiography and estimation of aortic blood flow using quantitative Doppler and VFM. The regurgitation ratio (RegR), derived as the quotient of backward and forward aortic FV in the ascending aorta measured by VFM, increased with AR severity: 1.1 ± 1.5% (normal), 11.4 ± 3.8% (mild AR), 31.2 ± 8.0% (moderate AR), and 59.3 ± 4.7% (severe AR). In a linear regression model, RegR closely correlated with the VC width (r = 0.932) and regurgitation fraction and effective regurgitant orifice measured by the quantitative Doppler method (r = 0.929 and 0.891, respectively). The intra- and interobserver variability of RegR was 4.2 and 6.7%, respectively. There was no difference between RegR measured in the apical five-chamber view and in that in apical three-chamber view using the paired t-test (P = 0.751). Conclusion: RegR measured by VFM, a new Doppler method allowing quantitative analysis of FV in spite of the presence of turbulent flow, is a highly reproducible parameter with good accuracy for AR quantification. © The Author 2009.

77951095969	Will simultaneous measurement of E/e' index facilitate the non-invasive assessment of left ventricular filling pressure in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation?	Aims: The ratio of early transmitral flow velocity (E) to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (e') was applied as a non-invasive index to assess left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP). However, the reliability of E/e' was undermined in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Recently, a novel method entitled 'dual Doppler' was established, which allows simultaneous recording and display of E and e'. Our study investigates whether the dual-Doppler method improves the reliability of E/e' in AF patients. Methods and Results: Forty-nine patients with non-valvular AF underwent conventional echocardiography, dual-Doppler echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization within 4 h. Of 22 patients (45c) with increased LVFP (>15 mmHg), higher E/e' measured by both conventional tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and dual-Doppler method was observed. Conventional echocardiographic variables were correlated with LVFP (E/e'sep, r = 0.404, E/e'lat, r = 0.487), but E/e' measured synchronously in the dual-Doppler mode yielded a better correlation (E/e'synchronous sep, r = 0.754, E/e'synchronous lat, r = 0.765). The intra- and interobserver variability of the dual-Doppler method was significantly lower than the conventional TDI method. Conclusion: Good correlations were found between E/e'' and LVFP in patients with AF, particularly in the dual-Doppler mode. E/e' measured by the dual-Doppler method can therefore be applied to assess diastolic dysfunction in AF patients.Registry number: ChiCTR-DT-00000342. © The Author 2009.

77952372108	Application value of Fibroscan in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis	Fibroscan (FS) is a novel non-invasive method to assess hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease by measuring liver stiffness. It is a rapid and user-friendly technique that can be easily performed with immediate results and good reproducibility. So far, FS has been used not only in patients with chronic hepatitis C but also in those with chronic liver diseases of other etiologies, such as chronic hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic liver disease. Moreover, FS appears to be an excellent tool for early detection of cirrhosis and complications of cirrhosis. As FS has excellent patient acceptance, it is useful for monitoring fibrosis progression and regression in the individual case. However, some influencing factors and certain limitations exist in the clinical application of FS. The aim of this article is to review the application value of FS in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis.

77951946551	Application of hepatitis B virus replication mouse model	Aim: To evaluate the value of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication mouse model with regard to several aspects of the study of HBV biology. Methods: To evaluate the HBV replication mouse model in detecting the efficacy of anti-HBV agents, the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polytidylin acid (polyIC) and nucleotide analogues adefovir and entecavir were administered to mice injected with wild type pHBV4.1, and the inhibiting effect of these agents on HBV DNA replication was evaluated. To identify the model's value in a replication ability study of HBV drug-resistant mutants and a HBx-minus mutant, telbivudine resistance mutants (rtM204I, ayw subtype), adefovir resistance mutants (rtA181V + rtN236T, ayw subtype) and HBxminus mutants were injected respectively, and their corresponding HBV DNA replication intermediates in mouse liver were assessed. Results: Compared with the wild type HBV replication mouse model without antiviral agent treatment, the HBV DNA replication intermediates of the polyICtreated group were decreased 1-fold; while in the entecavir-and adefovir-treated groups, the levels of HBV DNA replication intermediates were inhibited 13.6-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. For the mouse models injected with telbivudine resistance mutant, adefovir resistance mutant and HBx-minus mutant, HBV DNA replication intermediates could still be detected, but the levels of HBV DNA replication intermediates of these mutants decreased 4.5-fold, 5.6-fold and 2.9-fold respectively, compared with the mouse model with wild type HBV plasmid. Conclusion: The HBV replication mouse model we established was a useful and convenient tool to detect the efficacy of antiviral agents and to study the replication ability of HBV mutants in vivo. © 2010 Baishideng.

77954423599	Nucleoside analogue can improve the long-term prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus infection-associated acute on chronic liver failure	Background: The prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is extremely poor. Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nucleoside analogue treatment of patients with HBV-associated ACLF. Methods: We used a retrospective review of eligible patients from April 2006 to December 2008. Eligible subjects received 0.5 mg entecavir daily until October 2009 (group A), 100 mg lamivudine daily until October 2009 (group B), or no nucleoside analogue (group C). The primary endpoints were three-month survival and the rate of recurrence of HBV-associated ACLF. The secondary endpoints were HBV DNA levels, liver function, the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and adverse events. Results: A total of 104 consecutive patients were recruited, and 33, 34, and 37 patients were randomly allocated to groups A, B, and C, respectively. Although no significant difference in three-month survival was observed, levels of HBV DNA and rates of recurrence of HBV-associated ACLF were lower. Liver function and MELD score were not significantly improved despite significantly reduced HBV DNA levels. Conclusions: These data indicated that nucleoside analogue treatment did not improve the short-term prognosis of patients with HBV-associated ACLF although it was efficacious and safe in the management of HBV DNA levels. Intriguingly and importantly, continuous nucleoside analogue treatment can significantly reduce the rate of recurrence, which might be indicative of the further benefit of long-term survival. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

78449304439	Analysis of pulmonary infection of hospitalized patients injured in the Wenchuan earthquake in china	Background: On 12 May 2008, a devastating earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale hit Wenchuan County, Sichuan in China, and resulted in the casualties of thousands of people. Some of the hospitalized earthquake victims can occur pulmonary infection. However, few studies have been conducted on the clinical features of pulmonary infection in hospitalized casualty after Wenchuan Earthquake. Methods: To analyze retrospectively the clinical data of 115 e > 60 years; 74 cases (64.3%) of them with long-term hospitalization(> 20 days); 23 cases (20.0%) of them with traumatic brain injury; 71 cases (61.7%) with torso trauma; 58 cases (50.4%) of them were patients with underlying disease; 25 cases(21.7%) of them were the patients treated with mechanical ventilation. A total of 143 nonduplicate clinical isolates from sputum specimen of 115 pulmonary infection patients were analyzed. Gram-negative bacilli were the most commonly isolated pathogens (73.4%). Only 7.7% of total isolates were gram-positive bacteria; 18.9% of total isolates were fungi. There were high rates of multiple drug resistance in most bacteria isolates. The detection rates and resistance rates of Acinetobacter baumannii were higher than others and 81.8% of all Staphylococcus aureus detected from sputum culture were resistant to antibiotics but vancomycin in this group patients. There were 98 cases of recovery, 17 death cases due to lung infection. Conclusions: Most of earthquake inpatients with pulmonary infection were patients with age > 60 years, longer hospital stay or severe trauma. These factors might increase the risk of pulmonary infection in earthquake inpatients. Gram-negative bacilli play the most important role in these pulmonary infection patients. Pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Methicillin resistant S.aureus in this study might increase the risk of nosocomial infection. The prevention and control of pulmonary infection are crucial for earthquake survivors during hospitalization.

78650709897	Progress in research of primary hepatic lymphoma	Primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) is a rare malignancy whose pathogenesis is still unclear. Most PHL patients present with upper abdominal pain, upper abdominal distention or discomfort. Laboratory tests may reveal either a cholestatic or a cytolytic process, with elevated lactate dehydrogenase in most patients. Imaging tests often reveal an isolated lesion in the liver. The predominant histological type of PHL is B-cell lymphoma. At present, there are no standard diagnostic criteria for PHL. PHL is often misdiagnosed as many other liver diseases. Biopsy is usually performed to make a definite diagnosis. Treatment options for PHL include various modalities, and the prognosis of PHL is better than that of primary hepatic carcinoma.

78751496203	Characterization of tumor-suppressive function of SOX6 in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Purpose: By using cDNA microarray analysis, we identified a transcriptional factor, SOX6, was frequently downregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The aim of this study is to investigate the role of SOX6 in human esophageal cancer development, and to examine the prevalence and clinical significance of SOX6 downregulation in ESCC. Experimental Design: Expressions of SOX6 mRNA in 50 ESCCs and SOX6 protein in 300 ESCCs were investigated by semiquantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The tumor-suppressive function of SOX6 was characterized by cell growth, foci formation, wound-healing and cell invasive assays, and tumor xenograft experiment. Western blot analysis was applied to detect protein expression levels. Results: SOX6 was frequently downregulated in primary ESCCs in both mRNA level (29/50, 58%) and protein level (149/219, 68.0%), which was significantly associated with the poor differentiation (P = 0.029), lymph node metastases (P = 0.014), advanced TNM stage (P = 0.000), and disease-specific survival (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that the downregulation of SOX6 (P = 0.000) was a significant independent prognostic factors for ESCC. Functional studies showed that SOX6 was able to suppress both in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic ability of ESCC cells. The tumor-suppressive mechanism of SOX6 was associated with its role in G1/S cell-cycle arrest by upregulating expressions of p53 and p21

79551494434	Construction of a highly-active, liver-specific transcriptional regulatory element through combination of the albumin promoter and α-fetoprotein enhancer	In an attempt to construct a highly active, liver-specific transcriptional regulatory element, the mouse albumin promoter (ALBp) and α-fetoprotein enhancer (AFPe) were obtained. To verify its hepatic specificity and activity, the AFPe-ALBp-containing fragment was cloned into the plasmids, pVAX-S and pGL3-Luc with original promoter removed. Plasmid pVAX-AFPe-ALBp-S was then transfected into hepatic and non-hepatic cells in vitro, and delivered into mouse by intravenous injection and intramuscular injection, respectively. In addition, pGL3-AFPe-ALBp-Luc was transfected into hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines; pVAX1, pVAX1/S, and pGL3-ALBp-Luc were used as controls. The expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was observed, and luciferase activity in cells was measured. For plasmid pVAX-AFPe-ALBp-S, the expression of HBsAg was observed in hepatic cell lines, but not in a non-hepatic cell line. Using pVAX-S, the expression of HBsAg was observed in both hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines. In cells expressing pGL3-AFPe-ALBp-Luc, the level of luciferase activity was significantly higher in hepatic cell lines, compared with the non-hepatic cell lines. In addition, the level of luciferase activity in cells expressing pGL3-AFPe-ALBp-Luc was significantly higher than that of pGL3-ALBp-Luc in hepatic cell lines, suggesting that AFPe could enhance target gene expression under the control of ALBp. The expression of HBsAg was detected in mouse liver, but not muscle when using pVAX-AFPe-ALBp-S. In contrast, the expression of HBsAg was detected in both mouse liver and muscle upon transfection with pVAX-S. In conclusion, the AFPe-ALBp element could be used as a tool to induce liver-specific expression of a target gene. © 2010.

There are a considerable number of HBV-infected people in China. Antiviral therapy is key to disease control. However, the curative effect of currently available antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis B is not ideal. Antiviral therapy should be optimized to improve the efficacy and reduce the incidence of drug resistance. At present, optimal therapy strategy involves choosing a therapeutic scheme based on baseline characteristics of the patient and utilizing the roadmap concept to adjust treatment plan according to early virologic response.

79952770726	Management of gas gangrene in Wenchuan earthquake victims	Gas gangrene is an emergency condition, which usually develops after injuries or surgery. This study was designed to investigate clinical characteristics, appropriate therapy, and effective control of nosocomial cross-infection of gas gangrene in Wenchuan earthquake victims. Data on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of confirmed, suspected, or highly suspected gas gangrene were collected. Sixty-seven (2.41%) cases of suspected gas gangrene were found, in which 32 cases were highly suspected of gas gangrene and 5 cases were confirmed by culture of Clostridium perfringens. Thereof, injury sites were mainly located on the limbs, and typical indications, including crepitation, severe localized pain, swelling, wound discoloration, dark red or black necrotic muscle, foul smell as well as different degrees of systemic toxic performance were common among them. After hospitalization, all patients were isolated and had surgery quickly to remove dead, damaged or infected tissue. The wounds were also exposed for drainage and washed or padded with 3% liquid hydrogen peroxide for disinfection before all diagnostic test results were available. Additionally, high doses of antibiotics (mainly penicillin) were given for the prevention of infection, and supportive therapy was applied for corresponding symptoms control. Among those cases, no fatality was reported. In summary, in post-disaster emergency relief, the diagnosis of gas gangrene should be primarily based on clinical manifestations; while patient isolation, wound debridement and disinfection, as well as antibiotics treatment, is the main measures for proper treatment and control of nosocomial infection for gas gangrene. © 2011 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79954999818	Feasibility of assessing cardiac systolic function using longitudinal fractional shortening calculated by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography	Background: The left ventricular longitudinal fractional shortening (LVLFS) evaluated by the speckle tracking method reflects the longitudinal contraction of left ventricle (LV). We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of LVLFS as an index of LV systolic function. Methods: Two hundred thirty-three patients with or without heart failure (HF) were divided into four groups according to the progress of HF. Conventional echocardiography and two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) were performed in all subjects. Besides, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images were acquired in a subgroup of 30 patients with poor echo image quality. LVEF was measured using the biplane Simpson's method by two-dimensional echocardiography and CMR, respectively. LVLFS was calculated using QLAB 7.0, which performed speckle tracking analysis automatically. Results: Generally, LVLFS declined accordingly with the progression of HF (P < 0.05). In a liner regression model, LVLFS correlated well with conventional LVEF (r = 0.856, P < 0.001). In the subgroup study performed in patients with poor acoustic windows, LVLFS correlated better with LVEF measured by CMR than conventional LVEF measured using biplane Simpson's method (r = 0.899 vs. 0.848). As for the reproducibility, better intra- and interobserver variability was observed in LVLFS than in conventional LVEF (6.2 ± 3.5% vs. 8.5 ± 4.7% and 7.8 ± 5.6% vs. 11.3 ± 6.2%, P < 0.05), especially for patients with poor image quality. Besides, measurement of LVLFS is much less time-consuming than conventional LVEF. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest a linear relationship between LVLFS and LVEF. LVLFS may provide sensitive and accurate assessment of LV systolic function, and its measurement reproducibility is better than that of LVEF. © 2011, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Patients and Methods: In this prospective study, 100 naïve patients were assigned to treatment with ADV (33 HBeAg-positive and 19 HBeAg-negative patients) or ETV (32 HBeAg-positive and 16 HBeAgnegative patients). The primary efficacy outcome was ALT normalization, reduction in HBV DNA, and seroconversion of HBeAg. Second efficacy outcomes included resistance and safety. Comparisons of quantitative and qualitative variables between groups were analyzed by student t-test and chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test), respectively. Results: Among HBeAg-positive patients, ETV was superior to ADV with respect to mean reduction in HBV DNA (-7.5 versus -6.3, respectively, at Month 24, p=0.003) and the percentage of those with HBV DNA<103 copies/mL at Month 24 [96.9% (31/32) vs. 69.7% (23/33), respectively, p=0.002] and <300 copies/mL at Month 24 [84.4% (27/32) vs. 54.5% (18/33), respectively, p=0.004]. But, the rates of ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion between the groups were similar [87.9% (29/33) vs. 96.9% (31/32), respectively, p=0.355; and 24.2% (8/33) vs. 25.0% (8/32), respectively, p=0.943]. In HBeAg-negative patients who received ETV or ADV, the reduction in HBV DNA (-6.8 versus -5.9, respectively, p=0.192), percentage of ALT normalization [100% (16/16) vs. 78.9% (15/19), respectively, p=0.109], HBV DNA<103 copies/mL [100% (16/16) vs. 89.5% (17/19), respectively, p=0.489], and HBV DNA <300 copies/mL [100% (16/16) vs. 84.2% (16/19), respectively, p=0.234] were similar. No ETV- or ADV-associated mutations were observed, and both agents were well tolerated. Conclusions: ETV and ADV are effective therapies for CHB. In HBeAg-positive patients, the efficacy of ETV is significantly superior to that of ADV, and in HBeAg-negative patients, the agents effect similar biochemical and virological responses. © 2011 Kowsar M.P.Co.

0036566779	Functional characterization of the interferon regulatory element in the enhancer 1 region of the hepatitis B virus genome	An interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)/ interferon regulatory element (IRE) spanning nucleotide coordinates 1091-1100 is present in the enhancer 1/X gene promoter region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome. In the context of a minimal promoter element, the enhancer 1/X gene promoter ISRE/IRE was shown to be a functional regulatory site capable of mediating interferon α- (IFNα) and interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)-specific transcriptional activation in transient transfection analysis. The enhancer 1/X gene promoter ISRE/IRE was also shown to mediate interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 and IRF7 activation of transcription from a minimal promoter construct. In contrast, IFNα and the IRFs had minimal effect on HBV transcription and replication in the context of the viral genome in cell culture.

79957831260	Value of KCH criteria, MELD score and MELDNa score for prediction of prognosis of acute liver failure	AIM: To investigate the value of King's College Hospital (KCH) criteria, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and MELD with incorporation of serum sodium (MELDNa) score for evaluation of prognosis of acute liver failure. METHODS: A total of 37 consecutive patients with acute liver failure (ALF) were included in the study and divided into two groups according to the prognosis. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of MELD, MELDNa and KCH criteria were used to assess the prognosis of patients with ALF. RESULTS: The mortality of ALF was 70.3% in this study. MELD and MELDNa scores were significantly higher in the death group than in the survival group (43.8 ± 11.0 vs 31.0 ± 5.4, 43.4 ± 9.9 vs 32.1 ± 5.0, both P < 0.05). AUC-ROC of MELD score, MELDNa score and KCH criteria was 0.858 (0.704-0.950), 0.867 (0.715-0.955), and 0.645 (0.471-0.795), respectively. The sensitivity, specifcity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of MELD score were the same as those of MELDNa score but higher than those of KCH criteria (84.6 vs 65.4, 81.8 vs 63.6, 91.7 vs 81.0, 69.2 vs 43.7, 4.65 vs 1.80). CONCLUSION: MELD, MELDNa scores and KCH criteria have appreciable value to evaluate the prognosis of ALF patients. MELD and MELDNa scores are more accurate than KCH criteria in assessing prognosis of ALF patients.

79960349274	Seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus markers in individuals for physical examination in West China Hospital, China	Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) Is the major cause of chronic hepatitis,cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The global epidemiological scenario of HBV infection has been changing rapidly over the last two decades due to an effective immunization programme initiated by the World Health Organization. The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of HBV in apparently adult people who were taken health examination in our Hospital. Methods: A cross-sectional seroprevalence analysis of hepatitis B virus infection was performed in 12037 adult residents (aged ≥18 years) in Chengdu, who visited Health Examination Center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University for routine medical check-up during the period from March to December 2008. A structured medical form was used to collect data on demographic characteristics and risk factors. ELISA was used to test sera for HBV markers. Descriptive and logistic regression models were used for analysis. Results: A total of 12037 urban residents were involved. Prevalence of positive HBsAg was 6.1%, lower than the level of national seroepidemiological survey in (7.18%). Among HBsAg negative people, anti-HBs and anti-HBc was 60.2% and 13.6% respectively. There was a maximum between 18 to 29 years of age (61.8%) in anti-HBs positive people. Multivariate conditional logistic regressive analysis showed that, except for blood and vertical transmission, factors of male gender (OR, 1.876; 95% CI, 1.519-2.316; P<0.001) and alcohol intake (OR, 0.689; 95% CI, 0.571-0.832; P<0.001) were associated with a higher risk of positive HBsAg. Conclusions: Among the medical examination people in Chengdu, HBsAg positive rate was lower than the national general population, the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis B has been changed, because of vacination policies to the newborn; therefore, the necessity to continue to carry on the vaccination program.

80053344098	Influence of the preparation methods on LiFePO4-Li 3V2 (PO4)3 hybrid material	The "lithium iron(II) phosphate"-"lithium vanadium phosphate" hybrid composites (LFVP) were synthesized by two different methods, chemical blending and physical blending. The materials obtained from the experiment were samples of chemical LFVP (C-LFVP) and physical LFVP (P-LFVP). Comparing with the lithium iron(II) phosphate (LFP) and lithium vanadium phosphate (LVP), both hybrid samples showed improvements in electrochemical performance. The new substances yielding in the blending process were largely accountable for the improvements. Compared to P-LFVP sample synthesized by physical blending, the C-LFVP sample synthesized by chemical blending had demonstrated uniform shape, smooth surface and superior electrochemical performance. Thus, preparation methods had substantial influences on the hybrid materials. In the physical blending process (ball milling), the mechanical energy (high-speed ball running) undermined the crystallinity and grain morphology of the P-LFVP. The electrochemical performance of the chemical C-LFVP was much better than that of P-LFVP. The discharge capacity of C-LFVP is 192 mA h

80053474359	Human cell-death-inducing DFF45-like effector C induces apoptosis via caspase-8	Human cell-death-inducing DNA-fragmentation-factor (DFF45)-like effector C (CIDEC) is a potent apoptotic inducer. Previous studies have indicated that the Fat-specific protein 27 (Fsp27), a mouse homolog of CIDEC, induces apoptosis via caspase-3, -7, and -9 and triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which implies that the mitochondrial pathway is involved in Fsp27-induced apoptosis. In the current study, we found that CIDEC-induced apoptosis was mediated by caspase-8. The caspase inhibitor assay showed that CIDEC-induced apoptosis was dramatically reduced in the presence of the general caspase inhibitor, the caspase-3 inhibitor, and the caspase-8 inhibitor, whereas the caspase-9 inhibitor only weakly inhibited CIDEC-induced apoptosis. These results confirmed that the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 were involved in CIDEC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, in caspase-3- or caspase-8-deficient cells, CIDEC-induced apoptosis were dramatically decreased, which demonstrated that CIDEC-induced apoptosis might require the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. Because caspase-8 in general is a key effecter of death-receptor pathway and activated by Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD), we examined whether FADD was involved in CIDEC-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that CIDEC-induced apoptosis was independent of FADD, suggesting that CIDEC-induced apoptosis might be in a death-receptor-independent, caspase-8-dependent manner. It was also found that the region of amino acid 168-200 in carboxyl domain of CIDEC was critical for its crucial pro-apoptotic function. © 2011 The Author.

80053495019	Effect of Lamivudine on chronic hepatitis B patients with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents therapy and research the drug resistance	Objective: To study the effect of Lamivudine on chronic hepatitis B patients with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents therapy, and research the drug resistance. Methods: Thirty-one cases of chronic hepatitis B patients who needed chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents therapy were enrolled and divided into two group, HBeAg-positive group (n = 20) and HBeAg-negative group (n=11), then given Lamivudine for preventive treatment. Virus response, biochemical response and serum response were evaluated as effective index, and analyzed the difference between the two groups for statistical significance. Meanwhile, drug resistance rate, impact factor of resistance and security were analyzed. Results: At the end of 48 weeks' treatment, the rate of HBV DNA under the detection limit was 41. 94%, and the decline of HBV DNA compared with baseline was 2. 35 lg. The normalization rate of ALT, the negative rate of HbeAg and the seroconversion rate of HBeAg/HBeAb were 92.31%, 25% and 20% respectively. HBeAg-positive group and HBeAg-negative group patients in the complete virus response, the decline of HBV DNA compared with baseline and the resistance rate had no statistics significance (P>0. 05). At the same time, virology breakthrough occurred in four patients, and resistance mutation was detected in three cases among them. The resistance rate was 9. 68%. The type of genotype mutation were all rtM204I. Multi-factor regression analysis showed that the baseline factors including age, gender, HBeAg status, baseline HBV DNA level and baseline ALT had no significant compact on drug resistance. Serious adverse reactions were not found in all patients. Conclusion: For chronic hepatitis B patients who needed chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents treatment, Lamivudine for preventive antiviral therapy is a good option with good antiviral effect and safety. It is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of drug resistance.

80053551346	Expression and clinical significance of adenomatous polyposis coli in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues	Objective: To investigate the role of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) development and progression and to explore the association of APC with the clinicopathological characteristics and five-year survival of ESCC patients. Methods: A total of 236 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal tumors and the corresponding normal epithelia were placed in a tissue microarray. Using tissue array and immunohistochemistry, the expression of APC was determined in the 236 ESCC tissues and their corresponding normal esophageal mucosal tissues. The correlation of APC expression with age, gender, tumor cell differentiation, lymph node metastasis, tumor-node-metastasis stage, general classification, and five-year survival rate of ESCC patients was analyzed. Results: APC protein expression was confined to the cytoplasm of ESCC cells. ESCC tissues had a significantly lower APC down-expression rate than the corresponding normal esophageal tissues (32.2% vs. 92.9%, P < 0.05). The APC down-expression was correlated with the tumor/metastasis/node stage (P= 0.002), but not with the age, gender, tumor cell differentiation, lymph node metastasis, or general classification (P> 0.05). Survival analyses showed that the abnormal expression of APC was associated with the five-year survival rate of patients with ESCC. Conclusion: APC down-expression may play an important role in the progression and development of ESCC, generally leading to a lower survival rate. Hence, APC has prognostic value, and is a potential therapeutic target of ESCC.

80054724892	Prospective evaluation of fibroscan for the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis compared with liver biopsy/AST platelet ratio index and FIB-4 in patients with chronic HBV infection	Background: The FibroScan (FS), the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and the FIB-4 index are simple and inexpensive methods to detect liver fibrosis. Aims: The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of FS for the noninvasive diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in Western Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection compared with APRI and FIB-4; the secondary objective was to determine liver stiffness measurement (LSM) cutoff values for the noninvasive diagnosis of significant fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. Methods: Overall, 175 consecutive patients with chronic HBV infection, successful liver biopsy, and alanine aminotransferase levels ≤2× ULN were prospectively studied. Liver fibrosis was graded by an independent pathologist using the METAVIR (F0-F4) classification. APRI and FIB-4 were calculated from laboratory data. Results: The area under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC) for LSM for significant fibrosis (METAVIR F2-3) and cirrhosis (F4) was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.98) and 0.98 (0.96-0.99), respectively. For the detection of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI were 0.81 (0.74-0.87) and 0.83 (0.77-0.90); the AUROC of FIB-4 were 0.86 (0.80-0.91) and 0.77 (0.68-0.85). FS optimal cutoff values for the identification of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis were 7.9 and 13.8 kPa, respectively. Conclusions: FS is a reliable predictor of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in Western Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection, and is superior to APRI and FIB-4. FS cutoff values could be considered as clinical reference for detecting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

80755175797	Hepatitis B virus X protein reduces starvation-induced cell death through activation of autophagy and inhibition of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway	The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with chronic infection. As a multifunctional protein, HBx regulates numerous cellular pathways, including autophagy. Although autophagy has been shown to participate in viral DNA replication and envelopment, it remains unclear whether HBx-activated autophagy affects host cell death, which is relevant to both viral pathogenicity and the development of HCC. Here, we showed that enforced expression of HBx can inhibit starvation-induced cell death in hepatic (L02 and Chang) or hepatoma (HepG2 and BEL-7404) cell lines. Starvation-induced cell death was greatly increased in HBX-expressing cell lines treated either with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or with an siRNA directed against an autophagy gene, beclin 1. In contrast, treatment of cells with the apoptosis inhibitor Z-Vad-fmk significantly reduced cell death. Our results demonstrate that HBx-mediated cell survival during starvation is dependent on autophagy. We then further investigated the mechanisms of cell death inhibition by HBx. We found that HBx inhibited the activation of caspase-3, an execution caspase, blocked the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and inhibited the activation of caspase-9 during starvation. These results demonstrate that HBx reduces cell death through inhibition of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Moreover, increased cell viability was also observed in HepG2.2.15 cells that replicate HBV and in cells transfected with HBV genomic DNA. Our findings demonstrate that HBx promotes cell survival during nutrient deprivation through inhibition of apoptosis and activation of autophagy. This highlights an important potential role of autophagy in HBV-infected hepatocytes growing under nutrient-deficient conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

83055187036	Hemoperitoneum in cirrhotic patients without abdominal trauma or tumor	Hemoperitoneum is associated with several emergency conditions and is especially evident when it occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of cirrhotic patients who did not have abdominal trauma or tumor but who developed hemoperitoneum. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records of 1276 consecutive cirrhotic patients with hemoperitoneum at our center between January 2007 and December 2009. Hemoperitoneum was confirmed by abdominal paracentesis. RESULTS: Of the 1276 cirrhotic patients, 19 were found to have hemoperitoneum, but only 6 did not have abdominal trauma or tumor. The occurrence of spontaneous hemoperitoneum in the cirrhotic patients was therefore 0.5%. Hemoperitoneum can occur spontaneously in severely decompensated cirrhotic patients with intra-abdominal collateral vessels and high scores on the model for end-stage liver disease and Child- Pugh-Turcotte test. Most patients presented with abdominal distension, abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth and hemodynamic instability with a significant drop in the hemoglobin level. Three patients died of hemorrhagic shock within 24 hours, and the other 3 died of hepatic encephalopathy or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis after 5 to 10 days because of further decompensation of the liver. CONCLUSIONS: Hemoperitoneum can occur in cirrhotic patients who do not have abdominal trauma or tumor. It mainly occurs in severely decompensated end-stage cirrhotic patients. Cirrhotic patients with hemoperitoneum have a poor prognosis. © 2011, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

Methods: In total, 168 treatment-naïve CHB patients were enrolled, including 117 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients and 51 HBeAg-negative patients who met the inclusion criteria. All patients were treated with ADV 10 mg per day for 48 weeks. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to investigate baseline factors, and responses at weeks 12 and 24 were analyzed as predictive values. Results: Multiple regression analyses showed that baseline HBeAg status and HBV DNA levels significantly affected the virological response (VR) (p<0.05), baseline ALT levels were an independent predictor of serological response (SR) (p<0.05) and the body mass index (BMI) may affect the biochemical response (BR) (p<0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the VR and SR between patients with a primary nonresponse (PNR) at week 12 and those with a VR at week 12 (p<0.01). Additionally, the VR was significantly different between patients with HBV DNA lower than 10

83555174571	Construction of a plasmid vector for liver-specific inhibition of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha expression	Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4a) is an important transcription factor in the liver, and regulates a large number of genes involved in many aspects of hepatocyte functions. In this study, a liver-specific transcriptional regulatory element comprised of albumin promoter (ALBp) and alpha-fetoprotein enhancer (AFPe) was obtained and cloned into the plasmid pHNF4sh-CMV(short hairpin RNA targeting HNF4α) with original CMV promoter removed, resulting to pHNF4sh-EP for liver-specific knockdown of HNF4α expression. In an attempt to verify its characteristics, pHNF4sh-EP was transfected to L02, HepG2, and COS1 cell lines in vitro and delivered into mice in vivo. pHNF4sh-CMV and pNCsh-EP were used as controls. For in vitro, the level of HNF4α mRNA and protein was decreased in all cell lines transfected with pHNF4sh-CMV whereas HNF4α mRNA and protein decreasing was only observed in L02 and HepG2 cell lines upon transfection with pHNF4sh-EP, and this decreasing was more significant as compared with pHNF4sh-CMV transfected cells. For in vivo, the decreasing of HNF4α mRNA and protein was observed in both liver and kidney tissues upon transfection with pHNF4sh-CMV. After transfection with pHNF4sh-EP, decreasing of HNF4α mRNA and protein was only found in liver tissue and this decreasing was more significant. No obvious HNF4α mRNA and protein decreasing was detected either in vitro or in vivo after transfected with pNCsh-EP. In conclusion, pHNF4sh-EP could highly-active and liver-specific knockdown of HNF4α expression liver and it will be useful for further study of the funcitions of HNF4α in liver. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

82955169692	Treatment of HCV patients before and after renal transplantation	Context: Patients with end-stage renal disease can easily acquire a hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection via several ways. An HCV infection is difficult to treat after renal transplantation due to the conflicting actions of immunosuppressant therapy to maintain the function of the transplanted kidney and viricidal interferon (IFN) or ribavirin (RBV) treatment. Antiviral therapy requires great caution to avoid the complex and potentially fatal pharmacological effects. In this review, we examined clinical challenges and potential solutions for this specific scenario. Evidence Acquisitions: We searched Pubmed (NLM), LISTA (EBSCO), Web of Science (TS). The management of patients on waiting list, the indications and regimens about treatment were studied. Results: More than forty papers about this topic were found, including seven small clinical trials. International consensus has been reached to test patients awaiting renal transplantation. HCV detection after renal transplantation warrants careful consideration of when to initiate antiviral therapy. Treatment will begin immediately if deteriorating liver function increases the risk for loss of renal function. The choice of regimen depends on the patient's renal function and is individualized under close observation. The immunosuppressive regimen will be adjusted accordingly before antiviral therapy is initiated. Conclusions: The effects of modified antiviral therapy on these patients varies because of individual characteristics and disease state, and also because of the difficulty associated with conducting a large clinical trial to obtain statistically sound conclusions. The management before transplantation is important and when antiviral therapy needs to start, careful consideration of risks and benefits is needed before initiating this type of treatment. © 2011, BRCGL, Published by Kowsar M.P.Co.

84855515888	A mutation in the interferon regulatory element of HBV may influence the response of interferon treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients	Background: A functional interferon regulatory element (IRE) has been found in the EnhI/X promoter region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome. The purpose of this study is to compare the gene order of responder and non-responder to interferon therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), so as to evaluate the relationship between IRE mutation and the response to interferon treatment for CHB patients. Results: Synthetic therapeutic effect is divided into complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and non-response (NR). Among the 62 cases included in this study, 40 cases (64.5%) were in the response group (CR and PR) and 22 (35.5%) cases were in the NR group. Wild type sequence of HBV IRE TTTCACTTTC were found in 35 cases (56.5%), and five different IRE gene sequences. included TTTtACTTTC, TTTCAtTTTC, TTTtAtTTTC, TTTtACTTTt and cTTtACcTTC, were found in 22 cases (35.5%), 1 case (1.6%), 1 case (1.6%), 2 cases (3.2%) and 1 case (1.6%) respectively. There were 41.9%cases (26/62) with forth base C→T mutation, consisted of 32.5% (13/40) cases in response group and 59.1% (13/22) cases in NR group. Among the 35 cases with IRE sequences, there were 67.5% (27/40) cases in response group and 36.4% (8/22) in NR group, and the difference in IRE sequences between two groups was statistic significantly (P = 0.027). The result suggested that there is likely relationship between the forth base mutation (C→T) of IRE region and the response of HBV to Interferon therapy, and this mutation may partially decrease the inhibition effect of interferon on HBV. Conclusion: The forth base C→T mutation in IRE element of HBV may partially influence the response of Interferon treatment in CHB patients. © 2012 Lu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84855864378	Study of the expression levels of Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha and 3 beta in patients with different outcome of HBV infection	Hepatocyte nuclear factors 4 alpha (HNF4) and 3 beta (HNF3) are members of a group of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs) that play important roles in regulating the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and liver inflammation. However, the relationship of the level of HNF4 and HNF3 with the severity of HBV-infected liver diseases is unclear. In this study, liver tissue samples from different types of HBV patients were collected, and HNF4 and HNF3 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of HNF4 was significant higher in patients with severe hepatitis B(SHB) than those with chronic hepatitis B(CHB) and liver cirrhosis(LC) (both P < 0.05), but similar between patients with CHB and LC (P > 0.05). And the expression of HNF3 was similar among patients with CHB, LC and SHB (P > 0.05 for all pairwise comparison). This suggests that the expression level of HNF4 was different in patients with different outcome of HBV infection, high expression level of HNF4 may correlate with occurrence of SHB. © 2012 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84859340024	Different models in predicting the short-term prognosis of patients with Hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure	Background and aims. Effective assessing the prognosis of patients with end-stage liver disease is always challenging. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of different models in predicting short-term prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Material and methods. We retrospectively evaluated survival of a cohort of patients with at least 3-month follow up. The receiver-operating-characteristic curves (ROC) were drawn for Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification, King's College Hospital (KCH) criteria, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), MELD combined with serum sodium (Na) concentration (MELDNa), integrated MELD (iMELD) and logistic regression model (LRM). Results. Of the 273 eligible patients, 152 patients (55.7%) died within 3-month follow up. In cirrhotic patients (n = 101), the AUCs of LRM (0.851), MELDNa (0.849), iMELD (0.845) and MELD (0.840) were all significantly higher than those of KCH criteria (0.642) and CTP (0.625) (all p < 0.05), while the differences among LRM, MELD, MELDNa and iMELD were not significant, and the most predictive cutoff value was 0.5176 for LRM, 30 for MELDNa, 47.87 for iMELD and 29 for MELD, respectively. In non-cirrhotic patients (n = 172), the AUC of LRM (0.897) was significantly higher than that of MELDNa (0.776), iMELD (0.768), MELD (0.758), KCH criteria (0.647) and CTP (0.629), respectively (all p < 0.05), and the most predictive cutoff value for LRM was -0.3264. Conclusions. LRM, MELD, MELDNa and iMELD are with similar accuracy in predicting the shortterm prognosis of HBV-ACLF patients with liver cirrhosis, while LRM is superior to MELD, MELDNa and iMELD in predicting the short-term prognosis of HBV-ACLF patients without liver cirrhosis.

84860238601	Visualizaion of right atrial flow patterns and quantification of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in patients with atrial septal defect by vector flow mapping	Objective To evaluate the ability of vector flow mapping (VFM) in visualizing right atrial flow and quantifying pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in patients with atrial septal defect (ASD). Methods VFM was performed on 30 patients with ASD and 50 healthy volunteers. The pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) was calculated using VFM and spectral doppler compared with that obtained through oximetric data derived from cardiac catheterization. Results Blood streams from superior and inferior caval veins did not collide but turned forward, contributing to a forward clockwise vortex during systole on the subcostal bi-atrial plane in the healthy volunteers. The vortex was disrupted continuously by a left to right shunt in the patients with ASD during the hole cardiac cycle. The Qp/Qs measured by VFM was less angle-dependent in all the cases than the other methods. The mean value of Qp/Qs of the healthy volunteers calculated by apical three-chamber view and apical five-chamber view ranged from 0. 84 1 to 1.15: 1, which is consistent with the theoretical value 1 of no left to right shunts. The values of Qp/Qs of patients with ASD measured by VFM and spectral doppler showed no significant differences with those obtained through oximetric data C(2.18±0.48) vs. (2.29±0.76), P = 0.29; (2.30±0.91) vs. (2.29± 0.76), P = 0.863. However, the Qp/Qs value measured by VFM had a better correlation with the oximetric data than that measured by spectral doppler (r=0.1, P<0.001 vs. r=0.38, P<0.05). The inter-observer and intraobserver variability of Qp/Qs measured by VFM was 9.84% and 9.86% respectively. Conclusion VFM can visualize right atrial flow field in patients with ASD and quantify Qp/Qs in a more accurate way than spectral dopier.

Drug resistance to NAs, however, has posed a major obstacle in obtaining sustained viral suppression. Standardized definitions of terms and nomenclature in discussing NAs resistance have been proposed. Drug resistance to NAs is produced by a combination of viral, host and antiviral drug factors. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms and effects of mutation sites that cause resistance to NAs is important for the design of rational treatment and management of patients with existing drug resistance. © 2011 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

84862820756	Inhibition of hepatitis B Virus replication by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha specific short hairpin RNA	Background: Previous studies showed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) may play a critical role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the effect of knocking down of HNF4α with RNA interference technique on HBV replication in a HBV replication mouse model. Methods: Four HNF4α, specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-producing plasmids were constructed. HBV mRNA and DNA replication intermediates were analysed using Northern and Southern blot respectively. The expression of HNF4α and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) was detected using immunohistochemistry technique. Results: One of the HNF4α shRNAs, HNF4α shRNA1, efficiently inhibited the expression of HNF4α in HepG2 cells and mice liver. HBV RNA transcripts and DNA replication intermediates in HNF4α shRNA1 group were decreased 67.3 and 76%, respectively, in HepG2 cells, and 68.1 and 70.6% in mice liver respectively. The expression level of HBcAg in the liver was also decreased with the inhibition of HNF4α expression. Conclusions: These results suggested that decreasing of HNF4α expression was associated with the reduced level of HBV replication in HepG2 cells and mice liver. These data indicated that HNF4α played a critical role in HBV replication in vivo, and HNF4α shRNA could inhibit HBV replication in vivo. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84862915577	Effect and predictive elements for 52 weeks' telbivudine treatment on naïve HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B	Background: Antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogs has been used for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Each kind of nucleoside analog has its own characteristics and suitability for patients. Telbivudine (LdT, brand name: Sebivo, Beijing novartis pharma Ltd) is the newest nucleoside analog, with strong and rapid viral suppression. However, its resistance rate is relatively high during long-term application, due to low genetic barriers to resistance. So, it is necessary to increase the effect and reduce resistance with effective management, according to baseline factors and early on-treatment responses. Objectives: To reveal possible predictive factors of the effect of telbivudine (LdT) treatment on naïve HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients to optimize treatment. Patients and Methods: A total 71 naïve chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. All patients were treated with LdT 600 mg Qd for at least 52 weeks. Multiple logistic regression analyses were done to investigate the predictive values of baseline factors and responses at Week 24. Results: The reduction in hepatitis virus B (HBV) DnA level was 6.44 ± 2.38 lg copies/mL at Week 52 compared with baseline. The complete virus response (CVR), biochemical response (BR), serological response (SR), and drug resistance (DR) were 61.99%, 77.46%, 35.21%, and 8.45% respectively. By multiple regression analysis, baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels significantly affected CVR (P = 0.024, oR = 1.008), and baseline ALT and baseline HBV DnA levels were independent compact factors of SR (P = 0.012, oR = 1.007; P = 0.001, oR = 0.423). The differences in CVR, SR, and DR in patients with ALT > 120 Iu/mL compared with patients with ALT ≤ 120 Iu/mL were statistically significant. The differences in SR in patients with HBV DnA > 107 copies/mL compared with patients with HBV DnA ≤ 107 copies/mL were statistically significant. Additionally, CVR, BR, and SR were differed significantly between patients with HBV DnA lower than 300 copies/mL at Week 24 and patients with HBV DnA higher than 300 copies/mL (P = 0.000, P = 0.0016, and P = 0.000, respectively). Conclusions: There were more responders among naïve HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients with lower HBV DnA levels (especially lower than 107 copies/mL) and higher ALT values (especially higher than 120 Iu/mL at baseline) to LdT treatment. Adjustments for treatment strategy should be considered if HBV DnA > 300 copies/mL at Week 24 is observed. © 2011 Kowsar M.P.Co. All rights reserved.

84863020116	Clinical characteristics of critical patients with pandemic influenza a (H1N1) virus infection in Chengdu, China	Objective: The critical illness of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection may be associated with relatively poor outcomes. The objective of this study is to describe clinical features and factors associated with the deaths of critical patients. Methods: Medical records of 26 critical patients with H1N1 infection admitted from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31, 2009, were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnosis was established by real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Results: The mean age of the patients was (40.4±18.4) years and 73.1% of them were male. Clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and sputum production. The laboratory findings included leukocytosis, lymphopenia, C-reaction protein, and lactic dehydrogenase elevation. In this series, 17 subjects survived and 9 died. The parameters between the deaths and survivors were compared, which included acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores (23.8±10.1 vs. 14.3±6.6, P<0.05), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (13.3±3.0 vs. 6.6±3.3, P<0.05), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) scores (7.4±2.5 vs. 3.3±1.7, P<0.05). The cases of deaths had higher incidences of cardiovascular failure (100% vs. 41.2%, P<0.05), renal failure (55.6% vs. 11.7%, P<0.05), encephalopathy (44.4% vs. 5.9%, P<0.05), hepatic failure (33.3% vs. 5.9%, P<0.05), and septic shock (33.3% vs. 17.6%, P<0.05). Conclusions: The critical patients with H1N1 infection have high APACHE II, SOFA, and MODS scores, which may be associated with an increased risk of death and complex clinical courses. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84863233139	Pre-core/basal-core promoter and reverse transcriptase mutations in chronic HBV infected-patients	Background/Aims: Some HBV mutations have been shown to have an association with liver disease. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-core/basal core promoter (BCP) and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions and their relationship with disease progression in chronic HBV-infected patients. Methodology: A total of 133 patients were enrolled in this study, comprising the acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The pre-core/BCP and RT gene fragments were amplified by high-fidelity PCR. Mutations of pre-core/BCP and RT regions were examined by direct sequencing. Results: There were no significant differences in age, the average level of ALT and course of disease between the ACLF-HBV and CHB groups. The HBeAg positive rate and average values of HBV-DNA loads of the ACLF-HBV patients were lower than that of CHB patients. In HBV pre-core/BCP region, the point mutations T1753C (39.06% vs. 21.74%, p<0.01), A1762T (26.56% vs. 13.04%, p<0.05), G1764A (31.25% vs. 18.84%, p<0.01), G1896A (29.69% vs. 15.94%, p<0.05) and G1899 (23.44% vs. 10.14%, p<0.05) were significantly more frequent in the ACLF-HBV than CHB patients. For combined mutations, A1762T+G1764A (23.43% vs. 11.59%, p<0.05) and G1896A+ G1899A (21.88% vs. 13.04%, p<0.05) were significantly more frequent in ACLF-HBV than CHB patients. However, there were no significant differences in RT mutations between two groups. Conclusions: ACLF-HBV patients had more frequent mutations in HBV pre-core/BCP region than that of CHB patients. Some mutations in HBV pre-core/BCP region might be related to the aggravation of chronic HBV infection. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

84863338877	A superoxide-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 degradation and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation pathway for luteolin-induced lung cancer cytotoxicity	Although luteolin is identified as a potential cancer therapeutic and preventive agent because of its potent cancer cell-killing activity, the molecular mechanisms by which its cancer cell cytotoxicity is achieved have not been well elucidated. In this report, luteolin-induced cellular signaling was systematically investigated, and a novel pathway for luteolin's lung cancer killing was identified. The results show that induction of superoxide is an early and crucial step for luteolin-induced apoptotic and nonapoptotic death in lung cancer cells. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was potently activated after superoxide accumulation. Suppression of superoxide completely blocked luteolin-induced JNK activation, which was well correlated to alleviation of luteolin's cytotoxicity. Although luteolin slightly stimulated the JNK-activating kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7, the latter was not dependent on superoxide. We further found that luteolin triggers a superoxide-dependent rapid degradation of the JNK-inactivating phosphatase mitogen- activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). Introduction of a degradation-resistant MKP-1 mutant effectively attenuated luteolin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that inhibition of the JNK suppressor MKP-1 plays a major role in luteolin-induced lung cancer cell death. Taken together, our results unveil a novel pathway consisting of superoxide, MKP-1, and JNK for luteolin's cytotoxicity in lung cancer cells, and manipulation of this pathway could be a useful approach for applying luteolin for lung cancer prevention and therapy.

84863360660	Phase II metabolites of several flavonoids and their pharmacological activities	Flavonoids are a large category of natural products present in foods and drugs with diverse pharmacological activities. Recent researches suggest that flavonoids exist in vivo mainly as their phase II metabolites including a series of aglycone glucuronides, sulfates and their mixtures. Some of them have been proved to possess some pharmacological activities like anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-tumor effects and can interact with metabolic enzymes and transporters. This review discusses the previous researches on phase II metabolites of flavonoids include flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, flavonones, flavan-3-ols and anthocyanidins and their pharmacological activities.

84865319280	High Rates of Viral Suppression After Long-term Entecavir Treatment of Asian Patients With Hepatitis B e Antigen-Positive Chronic Hepatitis B	There are limited data on the effects of long-term entecavir therapy in Asian patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We performed a post hoc analysis of 94 Asian hepatitis B e antigen-positive (HBeAg+), nucleos(t)ide analogue-naive patients who received 5 years of therapy with entecavir (up to 2 years in study ETV-022 and the remainder in study ETV-901). Among patients completing week 240, 95% (63 of 66) had levels of hepatitis B virus DNA <300 copies/mL, and 76% (50 of 66) had normalized levels of alanine aminotransferase. In addition to patients who achieved a serologic response during ETV-022, a further 40% (26 of 65) achieved HBeAg loss, and 18% (12 of 65) underwent HBeAg seroconversion through year 5 of entecavir therapy. No resistance to entecavir was detected, and the safety profile was consistent with previous reports. The long-term efficacy and safety of entecavir are therefore comparable between Asians and the overall population of HBeAg+ patients with CHB. © 2012 AGA Institute.

84865730951	Lamivudine plus adefovir or telbivudine plus adefovir for chronic hepatitis B patients with suboptimal response to adefovir	Background: There is no standard management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with suboptimal response to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs). This study aimed to evaluate two different NA combination therapies in patients with suboptimal response to adefovir (ADV). Methods: In this study, 72 CHB patients with suboptimal response to ADV were assessed, with 37 patients receiving lamivudine plus ADV (group A) and 35 patients receiving telbivudine plus ADV (group B). Results: Baseline characteristics between two groups were similar. At month 12, rates of biochemical response (BR) and virological response (VR) were similar between groups A and B (17/19 versus 18/20 for BR, [P=0.269] and 30/37 versus 31/35 for VR [P=0.377]), and cumulative rates of serological response were greater in group B than in group A (10/26 versus 2/28 in hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] loss [P=0.006] and 7/26 versus 1/28 in HBeAg/hepatitis B e antibody seroconversion [P=0.022]). After 12-month treatment, 8.1% (3/37) of patients in group A and 5.7% (2/35) of patients in group B had VR; among patients in group A, two had rtM204V/I and rtL180M and one had rtN236T, whereas the two patients in group B had rtM204I+rtL180M. Conclusions: Both combination therapies led to a significant decrease in HBV DNA. HBeAg serological outcomes were higher with telbivudine plus ADV combination therapy. ©2012 International Medical Press.

0036763743	Hemodynamics monitoring liver transplantation with color doppler ultrasound	By hemodynamic monitoring of liver transplantation with Color Doppler ultrasound, we observed the hemodynamic changes pre- and post-operatively and the patency of the anastomotic vessels, andby detecting or excluding the presence of complications, the prognosis is assessed. We measured the hepatic blood flow after orthotopic liver transplantation in recent 6 cases. and observed the patency of anastomosed vessels and the hemodynamics improvement of the portal vein and hepatic arteries. The abnormal liquid and solid echoes were not found around the transplanted liver in all 6 cases. The echoes of hepatic parenchyma and tubes were normal. The direction and speed of blood flow were also normal. Five of anastomoses of portal vein in 6 cases were patent. The rest one was a little stenosed, and the speed of local blood flow was a little faster. There were 11 patent ones and 1 mildly stenosed in the 12 anastomoses of inferior venae cavae. The speed index (SI) and resistance index (RI) of hepatic arterial blood flow distal to the anastomoses were all normal. Liver transplantation is the radical therapy of portal hypertension, and the color Doppler ultrasound is the best non-invasived method for monitoring the hemodynamic changes of transplanted liver.

0036893432	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β inhibits hepatitis B virus replication in vivo	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice expressing rat hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β) were generated by breeding HBV transgenic mice with transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress the rat HNF3β polypeptide in the liver. HBV 3.5-, 2.4- and 2.1-kb transcripts were reduced 2- to 4-fold in these mice relative to the HBV transgenic mouse controls. In contrast, the abundance of viral replication intermediates was profoundly reduced in HBV transgenic mice by overexpression of HNF3β. This results, in part, from the preferential reduction in the level of the pregenomic 3.5-kb RNA relative to the precore 3.5-kb RNA. Therefore, it is apparent that increased expression of HNF3β modestly reduces viral transcription and dramatically inhibits replication in vivo in the HBV transgenic mouse. This suggests that altering the activity of this transcription factor in vivo in chronic HBV carriers might be therapeutically beneficial.

0036920307	A pregenomic RNA sequence adjacent to DR1 and complementary to epsilon influences hepatitis B virus replication efficiency	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) possesses a 3.2-kb partially double-stranded DNA genome that is generated inside the nucleocapsid by the reverse transcription of the 3.5-kb pregenomic viral transcript. The initial steps in viral replication involve the recognition of an encapsidation signal termed epsilon (ε) at the 5′-end of the pregenomic RNA by the HBV polymerase. The polymerase-bound pregenomic RNA is subsequently incorporated into an immature nucleocapsid particle and minus-strand HBV DNA synthesis is initiated utilizing the bulge region of ε as a template and a tyrosine residue in the amino-terminal region of the polymerase as a primer. Three nucleotides complementary to the 3′-end of the bulge region of ε are synthesized and subsequently translocated with the polymerase molecule to the acceptor site located in the DR1 sequence present at the 3′-end of the pregenomic RNA. Using mutagenesis analysis, a sequence element designated phi (φ) located upstream of the 3′ DR1 sequence has been identified that is complementary to ε and is important for efficient viral replication. This element may bring the 3′ DR1 sequence into proximity with the three nucleotide primer synthesized at the bulge of ε and facilitate primer translocation to the 3′ DR1 acceptor sequence. Sequence elements with similar proximity to the 3′ DR1 sequences and complementarity to ε are present in the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), suggesting the φ regulatory element may be phylogenetically conserved due to its functional importance in hepadnavirus minus-strand DNA synthesis. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

0037474532	Crystal structure of tabtoxin resistance protein complexed with acetyl coenzyme A reveals the mechanism for β-lactam acetylation	Tabtoxin resistance protein (TTR) is an enzyme that renders tabtoxin-producing pathogens, such as Pseudomonas syringae, tolerant to their own phytotoxins. Here, we report the crystal structure of TTR complexed with its natural cofactor, acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), to 1.55Å resolution. The binary complex forms a characteristic "V" shape for substrate binding and contains the four motifs conserved in the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily, which also includes the histone acetyltransferases (HATs). A single-step mechanism is proposed to explain the function of three conserved residues, Glu92, Asp130 and Tyr141, in catalyzing the acetyl group transfer to its substrate. We also report that TTR possesses HAT activity and suggest an evolutionary relationship between TTR and other GNAT members. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0037529938	Cloning of HBsAg-encoded genes in different vectors and their expression in eukaryotic cells	Aim: To compare the efficiency of different plasmids as DNA vectors by cloning three HBsAg-encoded genes into two eukaryotic expression vectors, pRc/CMV and pSG5UTPL/Flag, and to express HBsAg S, MS, and LS proteins in SP2/0 cells, and to establish monoclone SP2/0 cell strains that are capable of expressing S or S2S proteins stably. Methods: Segments of S, preS2-S, preSl-preS2-S genes of Hepatitis B virus were amplified by routine PCR and preS1-S fragment was amplified by Over-Lap Extension PCR. The amplified segments were cleaved with restricted endonuclease Hind III/Not I followed by ligation with pRc/CMV, or BamHI/EcoR I followed by ligation with pSG5UTPL/Flag. After the plasmid vectors were cleaved with the correspond enzymes, the amplified segments were inserted into pRc/CMV or pSG5UTPL/Flag plasmid vectors with T4 DNA ligase. KOZAK sequence was added before the initial ATG code of each fragment using specific primer. The inserted segments in the recombinant plasmids were sequenced after subcloning. BALB/c mice myeloma cells (SP2/0 cell line) were transfected with the recombinant plasmids. The expressions of the different recombinants were compared by Western-blot, using a monoclonal anti-HBs antibody as the primary antibody and peroxidase-labeled multi-linker as the secondary. Stable SP2/0-pRc/CMV-S or SP2/0- pRc/CMV-MS clones were established through clone screening with G418. Results: Fragments with anticipated size were harvested after PCR. After recombination and screening, the sequences of the inserted segments in the recombinants were confirmed to be S, preS2S, preS1-preS2S and preS1S encoding genes, determined by sequencing. The results of Western-blot hybridization were positive for the anticipated proteins. Among them, pRc/CMV-S or pRc/CMV-MS demonstrated the highest expressing their respective antigen. Conclusion: Eight recombinant plasmids expressing S, M, L or preS1S proteins are obtained. For hepatitis surface antigen expression in eukaryotic cells, the vector pRc/CMV is superior to pSG5UTPL/Flag, and pRc/CMV-S and pRc/CMV-MS are the most efficient in the pRc/CMV clones. SP2/0 cells stably expressing HBsAg are established, and may be used as target cells for evaluating the CTL activity of a DNA vaccine in vitro.

0037904834	Identification of the protein-protein contact site and interaction mode of human VDAC1 with Bcl-2 family proteins	Bcl-2 family of proteins plays differential roles in regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, by either promoting or inhibiting the release of apoptogenic molecules from mitochondria to cytosol. Bcl-2 family proteins modulate the mitochondrial permeability through interaction with adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), ADP/ATP exchange, or oxidative phosphorylation during apoptosis. Although the mitochondrial homeostasis is affected by the relative ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, the molecular mechanism underlying the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins remains elusive.

84869204011	Biological characteristics of the rtA181T/sW172* mutant strain of Hepatitis B virus in animal model	Background: The effects of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181T/sW172* mutation on viral replication and pathogenicity was concerned recently. This study aimed to investigate the biological characteristics of rtA181T/sW172* mutant strain of HBV in animal model. Methods. The rtA181T/sW172* mutant plasmid was constructed using the pHBV4.1 (wild type HBV) as a template. The wild and mutant HBV replication mouse models were established utilizing a hydrodynamic technique. The titers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen, and HBV DNA in serum, and the levels of HBsAg, hepatitis B core antigen(HBcAg), HBV DNA replication intermediates (HBV DNA RI) and HBV RNA in liver were measured after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12 and 15 days of plasmid injection. Results: In wild-type HBV replication mouse model, serum HBsAg was high on day 1, 3, and 5, but became lower since day 7; while in mutant HBV mouse model, serum HBsAg was always at very low level. In liver tissues, HBV DNA RI of wild type HBV was detected on day 1 after transfection. The level subsequently peaked on day 3, gradually declined after day 5, and was almost undetectable on day 10. However, the HBV DNA RI levels of the mutant strain were always higher and lasted longer until day 15. Consistently, the expression levels of HBsAg and HBcAg in liver of the mutant group were significantly increased. Conclusions: In the case of the HBV rtA181T/sW172* mutation, the secretion of serum HBsAg was impaired, whereas HBV DNA replication and HBsAg/HBcAg expression were increased in liver. These results suggest that the mutation can impair HBsAg secretion, and may cause the accumulation of viral core particles in liver. © 2012 Dai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84872123402	Inhibiting the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha attenuates lipopolysaccharide/ D-galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure in mice	BACKGROUND: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) plays an important role in regulating cytokine-induced inflammatory responses. This study aimed to investigate the role of HNF4α in the development of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) induced by lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine (LPS/D-GalN). METHODS: The FHF model was induced by simultaneous intraperitoneal injection of LPS/D-GalN in mice. Three days prior to LPS/D-GalN administration, HNF4α short-hairpin interfering RNA expression plasmid or physiological saline was injected via the tail vein with a hydrodynamics-based procedure. The degree of hepatic damage and cumulative survival rate were subsequently assessed. RESULTS: The expression of HNF4α was increased in the early stage after LPS/D-GalN administration. Inhibiting the expression of HNF4α reduced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, alleviated histological injury, and improved the survival of mice with FHF. In addition, both serum and hepatic tumor necrosis factor alpha expression were suppressed when HNF4α expression was inhibited in mice with FHF. CONCLUSION: Inhibiting HNF4α expression protects mice from FHF induced by LPS/D-GalN, but the exact mechanism behind this needs further investigation. © 2012, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

84873600009	Correlation between 2D and 3D echocardiography in measuring aortic annuals diameter	Objective To compare the results of 2D and 3D echocardiography in measuring aortic annulus diameter (AAD). Methods Preoperitve transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT 3D TEE) were performed on 52 patients who underwent aortic valve replacements to measure AAD. The parameters were compared between systole and diastole. Results The parameters in systole were significant greater than those in diastole (P<0. 05). No significant differences in the AAD value were found between TTE and TEE. However, the AAD values determined with TTE and TEE were different from those determined with RT 3D TEE (P<0. 05). The two-dimensional measurements produced smaller AAD values in both systole and diastole than the 3D measurements (P< 0. 001). TEE correlated well with RT 3D TEE, with the r value of 0. 775 and 0. 765 for systole and diastole, respectively. The regression was 3D-AADs = 0. 531XTEE-AADs+19. 879 (mm). Conclusion RT 3D TEE can accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of aortic annulus and calculate the aortic annulus dimension. TEE-AAD correlates well with 3D-AAD.

84873968316	Impact of mild to moderate elevations of alanine aminotransferase on liver stiffness measurement in chronic hepatitis B patients during antiviral therapy	Aim: The accuracy of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis is affected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of mild to moderate elevations of ALT on LSM in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) during antiviral therapy. Methods: A total of 58 CHB patients with their ALT levels falling into the range of ×2 to ×10 the upper limit of normal (ULN) were recruited. ALT and LSM values were periodically assessed at baseline and 12, 24 and 48weeks. Results: The median ALT levels were 153.5 (76-544), 50.5 (11-475), 36.5 (9-265) and 30 (12-239) IU/L at baseline and 12, 24 and 48weeks, respectively. The corresponding median value of LSM was 8.8 (3.2-47.3), 6.15 (3.2-31.2), 5.9 (3.1-29.1) and 5.5 (2.8-21.5) kpa. However, after the ALT levels were normalized by the treatment, the values of LSM did not vary significantly (6.1 [3.0-17.7] vs 5.25 [2.8-21.5] kpa, P=0.381). Pretreatment fibrosis stages of liver biopsies corresponded with LSM after ALT normalization rather than baseline LSM (F0-1, 12/27 vs 23/25, P<0.001). Conclusion: The LSM values decreased in parallel with the decline in ALT levels in CHB patients with mild to moderate elevation of ALT. LSM became more accurate when applied to document the liver fibrosis or cirrhosis in CHB patients after the elevated ALT level has been treated to normal level. © 2012 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

84875073214	Colonic involvement in disseminated histoplasmosis of an immunocompetent adult: Case report and literature review	Background: Histoplasmosis is a common opportunistic fungal infection that is observed almost exclusively in immunodeficient patients, especially those with AIDS. Immunocompetent individuals that suffer from histoplasmosis are rarely reported, especially those with disseminated lesions, such as disseminated histoplasmosis. The observation of disseminated histoplasmosis with prominent gastrointestinal involvement, no respiratory symptoms (which is presumed to be the portal of infection), gastrointestinal pathological changes, and minor digestive system disorders make this case study exceedingly rare.Case presentation: We report the case of a 33-year-old immunocompetent male who presented with fever and weight loss. Based on investigations, the patient showed pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow involvement and marked colonic involvement. Finally, disseminated histoplasmosis was diagnosed and confirmed by stained smears of fine needle aspirates and biopsy from lesions in the bone marrow and colon. The patient showed appreciable regression of lesions following prompt treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate, and was treated thereafter with oral itraconazole following discharge from hospital.Conclusion: Disseminated histoplasmosis could be underestimated in immunocompetent patients. A high degree of clinical suspicion is essential in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, regardless of pulmonary symptoms, and whether in endemic or non-endemic areas. Early and accurate diagnosis is extremely important for the appropriate treatment of infection and to improve disease outcome. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods: A study was performed on 10 patients with ALCAPA retrospectively and the result was compared with coronary angiography to summarize its echocardiographic features. Results: Of the 10 patients with ALCAPA, there were 3 cases of infantile type and 7 cases of adult type. Left ventricular cavity was enlarged and the anterior and lateral wall motion was reduced in all patients with the infantile type ALCAPA. The trunk and branch of the right coronary artery was enlarged in patients with the adult type, meanwhile the diastolic blood flow signal could be detected in inter-ventricular septum and in the area supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery. The trunk of the left coronary artery originated from the pulmonary artery in 7 patients, the left circumflex artery originated from the pulmonary artery in another 3 patients. Diastolic blood flow signal could be detected by the Doppler echocardiogram in the pulmonary artery in all patients. One patient was misdiagnosed as coronary artery fistula, and correct diagnosis was made by the coronary angiography. In 1 patient, echocardiography examination suggested that the left coronary artery was originated from left coronary aortic sinus and angiography results showed that the left coronary artery was originated from the right posterior sinus of the pulmonary artery. Eight ALCAPA patients suffered from other cardiovascular abnormalities, including atrial septum defect, ventricular septal defect and noncompaction of ventricular myocardium. Conclusions: Abnormal connection of the left coronary artery with pulmonary artery and diastolic blood flow are typical echocardiographic findings in patients with ALCAPA. Coronary angiography serves as an important tool for the correct diagnosis of ALCAPA. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84877639953	Unexpected co-arctation of aorta detected by transesophageal echocardiography during patent ductus arteriosus ligation	In the presence of a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), aortic co-arctation (CoA) cannot be diagnosed clinically because PDA masks the clinical features. This condition impedes the identification of CoA by transthoracic echcocardiography. However, the closure of PDA can result in a severe clinical condition that causes a patient with undiagnosed CoA to suffer from shock and multi-organ failure. In this article, a case of PDA was presented, in which transesophageal echocardiography provided full information that could be used as reference to identify and define CoA during PDA ligation surgery. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878211773	Role and functional domain of hepatitis B virus X protein in regulating HBV transcription and replication in Vitro and in Vivo	The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) in the regulation of HBV replication remains controversial. In the present study, the role of HBx in regulating HBV replication was initially investigated in both HepG2 and Huh7 in vitro cell lines with a transient transfection system. Next, the regions of HBx responsible for transcriptional transactivation and promotion of HBV replication were mapped in an HBV replication mouse model by in vivo transfection of a series of HBx expression plasmids. In an in vitro setting, HBx deficiency had little effect on HBV replication in Huh7 cells, but impaired HBV replication in HepG2 cells. In an in vivo setting, HBx had a strong enhancing effect on HBV transcription and replication. For the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (amino acids [aa] 51 to 154) was required for this function of HBx, and the regions spanning aa 52 to 72 and 88 to 154 were found to be important for the stimulatory function of HBx on HBV replication. In conclusion, the role of HBx in HBV replication regulation is affected by host cell type, and HBx has an important role in stimulating HBV transcription and replication in hepatocytes in vivo. Further, the transcriptional transactivation function of HBx may be crucial for its stimulatory effect on HBV transcription and replication. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84878459996	Intermedin Suppresses Pressure Overload Cardiac Hypertrophy through Activation of Autophagy	Left ventricular hypertrophy is a maladaptive response to pressure overload and an important risk factor for heart failure. Intermedin (IMD), a multi-functional peptide, plays important roles in cardiovascular protection. In this study, we revealed an autophagy-dependent mechanism involved in IMD's protection against cardiac remodeling and cardiomyocyte death in heart hypertrophy. We observed that transverse aortic contraction (TAC) induction, Ang II or ISO exposure induced remarkable increase in the expression of endogenous IMD and its receptor components, CRLR, RAMP1 and RAMP3, in mouse hearts and H9c2 cell cultures, respectively. Furthermore, the heart size, heart weight/body weight ratios, cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis, interstitial collagen, hypertrophic markers including ANP and BNP expression were also significantly increased, which were effectively suppressed by IMD supplementation. In addition, IMD induced capillary angiogenesis and improved functions in hypertrophic hearts. We further observed that IMD induced strong autophagy in hypertrophic hearts and cultured cells, which was paralleling with the decrease in cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis. Furthermore, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, was used to block the IMD-augmented autophagy level, and then the protection of IMD on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis was almost abrogated. We also observed that IMD supplementation stirred intracellular cAMP production, and augmented the ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by Ang II/ISO exposure in H9c2 cells. In addition, we inhibited PI3K, PKA and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways by using wortamannin, H89 and PD98059, respectively, in H9c2 cells co-incubating with both IMD and Ang II or ISO, and observed that these inhibitors effectively reduced IMD-augmented autophagy level, but only H89 and PD98059 pre-incubation abrogated the anti-apoptotic action of IMD. These results indicate that the endogenous IMD and its receptor complexes are induced in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, and the autophagy stirred by IMD supplementation is involved in its protection against cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis through the activation of both cAMP/PKA and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways. © 2013 Chen et al.

84878909680	Expression of TRAIL in liver tissue from patients with different outcomes of HBV infection	Objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection triggers the production of TRAIL, suggesting that TRAIL may play a role in liver injury after HBV infection. However, it remains unclear whether TRAIL expression in liver tissue correlates with the extent of liver injury caused by HBV infection. The aim of this article was to investigate the correlation of TRAIL expression and disease severity. Methods: Liver biopsy specimens were collected from 71 patients with different outcomes of HBV infection, including 5. cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 18 cases of severe epatitis B (SHB), and 28 cases of liver cirrhosis (LC). Besides, specimens from 33 healthy individuals without detectable liver diseases were used as negative control (NC). The expression of TRAIL was measured by mmunohistochemistry. Results: Expression of TRAIL in the HBV-infected patients was higher than that in the NC (P< 0.001). Among the patients, TRAIL expression in the ones with CHB was significantly higher than that in NC (P< 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with SHB and NC or between the ones with LC and NC (P= 0.067 and P=0.178, respectively). Moreover, TRAIL expression in patients with CHB was higher than that in patients with SHB or LC (P< 0.001 for both), whereas no statistically significant difference was observed between patients with SHB and the ones with LC (P= 0.511). Conclusion: TRAIL is involved in the inflammatory and immunoregulatory response after HBV infection. However, there was no significant correlation between expression of TRAIL and the extent of liver injury. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84879087212	Perventricular device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect in pediatric patients: Technical and morphological considerations	Background We report our experience of using perventricular device closure (PVDC) in treating perimembranous ventricular septal defect (pm-VSD) with emphasis on technical and morphological considerations. Method Thirty-one pediatric patients with pm-VSD who underwent successful PVDC were enrolled in this study. The pm-VSDs were divided into three different types (type I: tunnel shape; type II: with subaortic rim < 2 mm; type III: membranous aneurysm formation). Four closure strategies were utilized, corresponding to the morphology of the pm-VSD. Results Mean age of the patients was 2.1 years with mean VSD diameter 5.8 mm. Seven patients had type I VSD, nine presented with type II, and 15 had type III. Twenty-two concentric and nine eccentric devices were used with mean device size 7.3 mm. Complete closure was achieved in 97% of cases during follow-up. Procedure-induced tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was noted in nine patients at discharge; four resolved. Multivariable analysis showed that the procedure-induced TR was associated with the device size (odds ratio = 5.059; 95% confidence interval = 1.431-17.880). Conclusion Different closure strategies allow for PVDC of various types of pm-VSDs in selected pediatric patients. © 2013 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

84879554892	Functional characterization of interferon regulation element of hepatitis B virus genome in vivo	The roles of interferon regulatory element (IRE) in Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome on inhibitory effect of interferon against HBV are controversial in vitro. This study aimed to determine the functional characterization of HBV-IRE sequence in vivo. Wild-type or IRE-mutant HBV replication-competent mice were firstly established, and mice were subquently treated with polyinosinic- polytidylin acid (polyI.C) or phosphate-buffered saline via intraperitoneal. Results showed that PolyI.C inhibited viral replication, and increased the level of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthase mRNA transcripts, a marker of INF-α/β induction. Between wild-type and IRE-mutant HBV replication-competent mice, the levels of HBV-RNA and HBV-DNA replication intermediates were similar. After PolyI.C treatment, the decreasing of HBV-RNA was similar between two groups, but HBV-DNA replication intermediates decreased significantly less in IRE-mutant than wild-type HBV replication-competent mice. These findings suggested that IRE mutant reduced the inhibitory effect of interferon on HBV replication, which played a role in antiviral effect of interferon against HBV. © 2012 Indian Virological Society.

84881154959	Preliminary report on use of 3-dimensional computed tomographic images in a disease-based transesophageal echocardiographic simulation system	We used 3-dimensional computed tomographic images to create a disease-based trans-esophageal echocardiographic simulation system for complex congenital heart defects. We enrolled 7 pediatric patients with complex congenital heart defects in this proof-of-concept study. Preoperative computed tomographic images and intraoperative transesoph-ageal echocardiographic images were acquired for all patients. Two- and 3-dimensional computed tomographic cross-sectional images were created to simulate the process of transesophageal echocardiographic image acquisition. Computed tomographic images simulating the midesophageal 4- and 5-chamber views, aortic valve short-axis views, long-axis views, and ascending aortic short-axis views were created to correspond with the actual transesophageal echocardiographic images from each patient. Four reviewers then evaluated the image quality of the computed tomographic images, the agreement between the echocardiographic and tomographic images, and the ability of the 3-dimen-sional computed tomographic full-volume and cross-sectional images to yield the spatial and temporal congruence of transesophageal echocardiograms.In most of the patients, computed tomography yielded images of good-to-excellent quality. Strong agreement was noted between the computed tomographic and transesoph-ageal echocardiographic images acquired in the same patients. The ability of 3-dimension-al computed tomography to yield the spatial and temporal congruence of transesophageal echocardiography in selected planes was also good to excellent.We found that 3-dimensional computed tomographic images can simulate the process of transesophageal echocardiography in acquiring the echocardiographic image clearly. This imaging method has the potential to be applied successfully to a disease-based trans-esophageal echocardiographic simulation system. © 2013 by the Texas Heart®Institute, Houston.

84882312048	Value of three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography and the novel area strain in detecting wall motion abnormalities of coronary artery diseases	Objective To investigate the value of three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) and the novel areas train (AS) in detecting wall motion abnormalities caused by coronary artery diseases. Methods Conventional and 3D echocardiography was done on forty-six patients suspected with coronary heart diseases, immediately before they received cardiac catheterization. Segmental wall-motion score (WMS) and WMS index (WMSI) were assessed on conventional two-dimensional (2D) images, and strain-derived parameters were analyzed by speckle tracking technique based on 3D images. The accuracy of echocardiographic parameters to assess the regional myocardial ischemia was tested against coronary angiography results using ROC curve analysis and linear regression. Results Compared with controls, patients with severe coronary stenosis (≥70% coronary stenosis) had lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher WMSI and lower global strains. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that segmental WMS had relatively poor sensitivity for regional myocardial ischemia and infarction. The segmental strains measured using 3DSTE provided accurate assessment of the regional wall motion abnormalities. The segmental area strain > - 25% yielded the best sensitivity and specificity for detecting the ischemic and infracted segments among all four strain parameters. Conclusion 3DSTE provides a swift and accurate assessment of regional myocardial motion. The novel area strain derived by 3DSTE is an accurate and reproducible index for regional wall motion abnormality.

84883232304	Hybrid perventricular device closure of doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defects: Mid-term results	Background Doubly committed Subarterial ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a specific anatomic type of VSD located just beneath the aortic valve. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using minimal invasive perventricular device closure in managing this type of VSD. Methods During Dec 2008 and Aug 2010, 34 Pediatric patients with doubly committed subarterial VSD who met the inclusion criteria for device closure were enrolled in this study. Perventricular closure was attempted using a unique design eccentric device under the guidance of real-time transesophageal echocardiography. Complications such as residual shunt, valve regurgitation, arrhythmias were all recorded in postoperative period and during follow-up. Result Perventricular device closure was successfully done in 28 patients (82%). 6 patients converted to open surgical repair due to residual shunt >3mm (1 patient), more than mild degree aortic regurgitation (3 patients) and device mal-position (2 patients). Complete closure rate was achieved in 93% at discharge and 100% during 20 months follow-up. No severe complications such as device embolism, significant arrhythmias and noticeable valve regurgitation were noted during follow-up. Procedure induced trivial grade aortic valve regurgitation was noted in five (18%) patients after procedure while only one (4%) persisted during midterm follow-up. Conclusion Perventricular closure of doubly committed subarterial VSDs appears to be a safe and effective minimally invasive technique with good mid-term outcomes. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84884417244	Quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen analysis in hepatitis B e antigen-positive nucleoside-naive patients treated with entecavir	Background: Entecavir is a potent nucleoside analogue for treating chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) levels are predictive of response to interferon-α in CHB treatment; however, the clinical utility of qHBsAg in nucleoside/nucleotide analogue-based CHB therapy is not fully characterized. This study assessed changes in qHBsAg in patients treated with entecavir in the Phase III study ETV-022. Methods: This retrospective post hoc analysis included nucleoside/nucleotide-naive, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients receiving entecavir (0.5 mg daily) in ETV-022 who had samples available for qHBsAg analysis through week 48. qHBsAg, HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase levels were assessed for the overall patient cohort, for cohorts with or without HBeAg loss or HBsAg loss by week 48, and by HBV genotype. Results: Overall, 95 patients from ETV-022 had available samples for qHBsAg analysis through week 48. In all cohorts, 48 weeks of entecavir therapy resulted in effective HBV DNA suppression. In the overall cohort, qHBsAg declined by -0.92 log

84884669058	Quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen titres in Chinese chronic hepatitis B patients over 4 years of entecavir treatment	Background: The clinical value of quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) titre in patients taking nucleotide/ nucleoside analogues (NAs) is still controversial. This study aims to investigate the dynamic changes of qHBsAg titres and their significance for predicting virological response (VR) and serological response (SR) to long-term entecavir (ETV) treatment. Methods: A total of 48 ETV-naive patients were enrolled and followed prospectively for 4 years, 32 of whom were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive at baseline. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), qualitative HBV serological markers and HBV DNA were detected; qHBsAg titres were measured using Elecsys® HBsAg II Quant Assay (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Results: The mean baseline HBV DNA and qHBsAg were 7.51 log10 copies/ml and 3.78 log10 IU/ml, respectively. After 48 months of ETV treatment, the rates of VR (<291 copies/ml), ALT normalization and SR (HBeAg/antibody to HBeAg [anti-HBe]) were 89.6% (43/48), 89.6% (43/48) and 34.4% (11/32), respectively. There was a decrease in qHBsAg titres from baseline to month 48, ranging from 3.78 to 3.10 log10 IU/ml. The greatest decrease of qHBsAg was observed in the first 3 months of treatment (0.47 log10 IU/ml), which was significantly correlated with corresponding HBV DNA decreases (3.89 log10 copies/ml; P=0.032). By using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, qHBsAg titres at baseline (area under the curve [AUROC]=0.647) and 3 months after treatment (AUROC=0.586) had poor power in predicting 48-month VR; qHBsAg titres at baseline (AUROC=0.779) and 3 months after ETV treatment (AUROC=0.658) had poor power in predicting 48-month SR in patients who were HBeAg-positive at baseline. Additionally, the decrease of qHBsAg in the first 3 months of treatment also had poor power in predicting either 48 month VR or SR. Conclusions: ETV is efficacious in NA-naive patients, and qHBsAg titres decreased significantly in the first 3 months of ETV treatment. However, qHBsAg titre was not a good predictor of 4-year VR and HBeAg/anti-HBe SR in this cohort. © 2013 International Medical Press.

84884212908	Differential regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in human with different types of mitral valvular disease	Background: Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are considered to play a prominent role in cardiac development, function, and pathogenesis. The different types of mitral valvular disease (MVD), including mitral regurgitation (MR) and mitral stenosis (MS), have different underlying pathophysiologic changes, but the precise intracellular signal transduction mechanisms are not clear. Thus, we investigated the differential regulation of MAPK signaling pathways in humans with different types of MVD. Methods: Left atrial appendage tissue samples from 32 patients with MVD who were undergoing mitral valve replacement surgery were studied. Serum angiotensin II concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of MAPK pathway-related genes and proteins was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results: Echocardiography showed that patients with MS had a greater left atrial pressure overload than those with MR. The relative amounts of angiotensin II, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, p38α, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2, c-Fos, activating transcription factor 2, and c-Jun mRNA were significantly upregulated in those with MS compared with those with MR (P < 0.05). The serum angiotensin II concentrations were significantly increased in those with MS compared with those with MR (P = 0.017). Substantial changes in the phosphorylated forms of the MAPK proteins were detected. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphorylated p38 were significantly increased in those with MS compared with those with MR (P < 0.001), and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the MR group was significantly greater than that in the MS group (P < 0.001). Histologically, more serious myocardial cells losses, myolysis, and interstitial fibrosis were detected in the MS group. Conclusions: The different types of MVD have different hemodynamic characteristics, and different MAPK pathways were activated in the MR and MS groups, which could lead to diverse left atrial histologic changes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84885442032	Efficacy and safety of entecavir treatment in a heterogeneous CHB population from a 'real-world' clinical practice setting in China	Chronic hepatitis B infection is an important cause of liver-related mortality in China. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of entecavir in a heterogeneous patient population from a 'real-world' clinical practice setting in China. This prospective, observational cohort provides 48-week data on 2600 patients from 50 sites in China who received entecavir (0.5 or 1.0 mg) and were assessed for virologic, serologic and biochemical responses. Patients were nucleos(t)ide-naïve or -experienced and had compensated or decompensated liver function. At Week 48, 1545/2424 (64%) patients with compensated liver disease and 30/44 (68%) patients with decompensated liver disease achieved HBV DNA <50 IU/mL. Greater proportions of nucleos(t)ide-naïve than nucleos(t)ide-experienced (69% vs 53%), and adefovir-experienced than lamivudine/telbivudine-experienced (62% vs 52%) patients achieved this endpoint. Most patients with HBV DNA <50 IU/mL also achieved HBV DNA <12 IU/L (60%, 45% and 61% of nucleos(t)ide-naïve, nucleos(t)ide-experienced and decompensated patients, respectively). In patients with compensated liver disease, ALT values normalized in 1532/1792 patients (85%), and HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion were observed in 17% and 15% of treatment-naïve and 15% and 11% of treatment-experienced patients. Entecavir was generally well tolerated. Adverse event rates were comparable between treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with compensated liver disease, but were higher in decompensated than in compensated patients, consistent with previous reports in these patients with more advanced disease. Four patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. In a 'real-world' setting, entecavir was efficacious and well tolerated throughout 48 weeks in a heterogeneous Chinese CHB population. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84886716998	Value of three-dimensional speckle-tracking in detecting left ventricular dysfunction in patients with aortic valvular diseases	Background The aim of this study was to investigate the value of three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography for the detection of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in patients with aortic valvular disease (AVD). Methods Fifty-nine patients with AVD in New York Heart Association functional class I or II as well as 48 controls were recruited. Patients with AVD were divided further into those with aortic stenosis (AS; n = 34) and those with aortic regurgitation (AR; n = 25). All patients underwent conventional echocardiography and three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. Results Analysis of variance showed global longitudinal strain to be compromised in the AR group (-16.9% vs -19.3%, P =.015) and more dramatically decreased in the AS group (-14.3% vs -19.3%, P <.001) compared with healthy controls. Impairment of global circumferential strain was observed in patients with AR (-15.9% vs -18.5%, P =.009) but not in those with AS (-18.2% vs -18.5%, P =.768). Global area strain and global radial strain were decreased in patients with AS and those with AR compared with controls, but the difference between the two subgroups was not significant. Conclusions Strains measured by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography are useful indices of early-stage heart dysfunction caused by AVD. Longitudinal strain is more vulnerable to pressure overload caused by AS, whereas circumferential strain is more sensitive to volume overload due to AR.

0141829797	Pathomorphological study on location and distribution of Kupffer cells in hepatocellular carcinoma	Aim: To clarify the location and distribution of Kupffer cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to investigate their role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: Kupffer cells were immunohistochemically stained by streptavadin-peroxidase conjugated method (S-P). The numbers of Kupffer cells in cancerous, para-cancerous and adjacent normal liver tissues of 48 HCCs were comparatively examined. Results: The mean number of Kupffer cells in cancerous, para-cancerous and adjacent normal liver tissues was 12.7±6.8, 18.1±8.2 and 18.9±7.9 respectively. The number of Kuppfer cells in cancerous tissues was significantly lower than that in para-cancerous tissues (t=2.423, P<0.05) and adjacent normal liver tissues (t=2.521, P<0.05). As tumor size increased, the number of Kupffer cells in cancerous tissues significantly decreased (F=4.61, PU<0.05). Moreover, there was also a significant difference in the number of Kupffer cells among well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly-differentiated cases(F=4.49, P<0.05). Conclusion: This study suggests that decrease of Kupffer cells in HCCs may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of HCC, the number of Kupffer cells in HCC is closely related to the size and differentiation grade of the tumor.

84888777923	Prolonged combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy in management of chronic hepatitis B patients with sustained virological response: An experience from a 'real-world' clinical setting	Background: Little is known about the duration of combination therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and suboptimal response to nucleos(t)ide analogues(NAs) monotherapy. Objectives: This study aimed to assess whether monotherapy could be used for treatment of CHB patients, who poorly responded to Adefovir Dipivoxil (ADV) but obtained good responses after at least 12-month lamivudine (LAM) or telbivudine (LdT) add-on therapy. Patients and Methods: Forty-five patients were enrolled, and the baseline time-point was determined according to enrollment data. Twenty-six patients chose to continue combination therapy (LAM+ADV or LdT+ADV, Group A) and 19 patients switched to single-drug maintenance therapy (LAM or LdT or ADV, Group B). Results: There were no significant differences between two groups in baseline characteristics (P > 0.05). At 12th month, sustained virological response rate was greater in group A compared to group B (96.2% vs. 47.4%, P < 0.001), and the rates of NAs-associated resistance were 0% in group A and 15.8% in group B. Alanine aminotransferase normalization rate was also significantly higher in group A compared with group B (92.3% vs. 36.8%, P < 0.001). Among hepatitis positive patients with Be antigen (HBeAg)-, 40% (4/10) in group A and 9.1% (1/11) in group B achieved HBeAg seroconversion at the 12th month. Of patients in group B with positive-HBeAg before the previous combination therapy and detectable HBV DNA at 6 months of previous combination therapy were associated with high risks of viral relapse after switching to single-drug maintenance therapy. Conclusions: Prematurely switching to single-drug maintenance therapy would be resulted in viral relapse, and prolonged combination therapy was effective to maintain sustained responses for patients with initial suboptimal response to ADV. © 2013, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal; Published by Kowsar Corp.

84892911721	The crosstalk between Nrf2 and AMPK signal pathways is important for the anti-inflammatory effect of Berberine in LPS-stimulated macrophages and endotoxin-shocked mice	Aims: The response of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to oxidative stress has been recently reported but the downstream signals of this response are largely unknown. Meanwhile, the upstream events for the activation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a critical transcriptional activator for antioxidative responses, remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between AMPK and Nrf2 signal pathways in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered inflammatory system, in which berberine (BBR), a known AMPK activator, was used for inflammation suppression. Results and Innovation: In inflammatory macrophages, BBR attenuated LPS-induced expression of inflammatory genes (inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS], cyclooxygenase-2 [COX2], interleukin [IL]-6), and the generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, but increased the transcription of Nrf2-targeted antioxidative genes (NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 [NQO-1], heme oxygenase-1 [HO-1]), as well as the nuclear localization and phosphorylation of Nrf2 protein. Importantly, we found BBR-induced activation of Nrf2 is AMPK-dependent, as either pharmacologically or genetically inactivating AMPK blocked the activation of Nrf2. Consistent with in vitro experiments, BBR down-regulated the expression of proinflammatory genes but upregulated those of Nrf2-targeted genes in lungs of LPS-injected mice, and these effects were attenuated in Nrf2-deficient mice. Moreover, the effect of BBR on survival time extension and plasma redox regulation in endotoxin-shocked mice was largely weakened when Nrf2-depleted. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate convergence between AMPK and Nrf2 pathways and this intersection is essential for anti-inflammatory effect of BBR in LPS-stimulated macrophages and endotoxin-shocked mice. Uncovering this intersection is significant for understanding the relationship between energy homeostasis and antioxidative responses and may be beneficial for developing new therapeutic strategies against inflammatory diseases. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84893666255	The progress of antiviral therapy in patients with HBV-related liver failure	Hepatitis B viral infection is a global health threat, with more than 1 million deaths caused by HBV-related liver disease every year. Approximately 1% of HBV-infected patients may end up with liver failure caused by spontaneous or induced factors, and the prognosis is extremely poor. The virulence of HBV is one of the major causes of liver failure and the antiviral treatment is normally given to these patients. But it is controversial if the antiviral therapy improves short-term mortality in these patients. There are many studies shown when add the antiviral drugs (nucleotide analogs) immediately may improve the survival, but in the late-stage the survival have no significant difference. For these patients who are waiting for the liver transplantation, the nucleotide analogs are still needed to prevent the recurrence of HBV. However, after antiviral treatment cessation, the disease relapse and severe acute exacerbation of hepatitis is common, therefore long-term antiviral treatment and potent drugs with low drug resistance are recommended for the HBV-related liver failure patients. © H.G.E.

84896488839	The 104-week efficacy and safety of telbivudine-based optimization strategy in chronic hepatitis B patients: A randomized, controlled study	An optimization strategy based on the Roadmap concept is supposed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with suboptimal antiviral response. The aim of this study was to prove the concept with a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study. In all, 606 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, nucleos(t)ide-naive chronic hepatitis B patients were randomized to the Optimize or Mono group. Patients in the Optimize group were treated with telbivudine for 24 weeks, after which those suboptimal responders with HBV DNA ≥300 copies/mL at week 24 received telbivudine plus adefovir until week 104, while the early virological responders continued telbivudine monotherapy. Patients in the Mono group received telbivudine monotherapy. All patients with telbivudine monotherapy had adefovir added if viral breakthrough developed. Sixty-eight percent (204/300) of patients in the Optimize group had adefovir added due to suboptimal response. At week 104, compared to the Mono group, more patients in the Optimize group achieved HBV DNA <300 copies/ml (76.7% versus 61.2%, P<0.001) with less genotypic resistance (2.7% versus 25.8%, P<0.001). The rates of HBeAg seroconversion and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization were comparable between the two groups (23.7% versus 22.1%; 80.7% versus 79.2%). For week 24 suboptimal responders, telbivudine plus adefovir showed an additive antiviral potency, with 71.1% achieving virological response at week 104 and only 0.5% developing genotypic resistance, compared with 46.6% who achieved virological response and 37.8% who developed genotypic resistance with telbivudine monotherapy. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated, with an observed persistent increase of the glomerular filtration rate. Conclusion: For suboptimal virological responders to telbivudine at week 24, adjusting the treatment strategy is recommended. Adding adefovir can benefit these patients with additive antiviral potency and low resistance without increased side effects. © 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

84899124006	LECT2 functions as a hepatokine that links obesity to skeletal muscle insulin resistance	Recent articles have reported an association between fatty liver disease and systemic insulin resistance in humans, but the causal relationship remains unclear. The liver may contribute to muscle insulin resistance by releasing secretory proteins called hepatokines. Here we demonstrate that leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), an energy-sensing hepatokine, is a link between obesity and skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Circulating LECT2 positively correlated with the severity of both obesity and insulin resistance in humans. LECT2 expression was negatively regulated by starvation-sensing kinase adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in H4IIEC hepatocytes. Genetic deletion of LECT2 in mice increased insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle. Treatment with recombinant LECT2 protein impaired insulin signaling via phosphorylation of Jun NH

84899758911	Visualization of right atrial flow and quantification of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in patients with atrial septal defect using vector flow mapping: Original article	Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of vector flow mapping (VFM) in the visualizing right atrial flow and quantifying pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) in patients with atrial septal defect (ASD). Methods: Thirty patients with ASD were included in this study. Fifty healthy volunteers were enrolled as control. The Qp/Qs was calculated using VFM and spectral Doppler, and compared with that based on the oximetry data derived from cardiac catheterization. Results: No convergence was formed between the blood streams passed from the superior and inferior caval veins, instead, the streams turned forward, which contributed to a forward clockwise vortex during the systole on the subcostal view of dual atria in healthy individuals. In patients with ASD, the vortex was disrupted continuously by a left-to-right-shunt during the whole cardiac cycle. Less angle-dependence of VFM was identified in the quantification of Qp/Qs. The mean Qp/Qs ratio obtained from the healthy individuals calculated by apical three-chamber (AP3c) view and apical five-chamber (AP5c) view was 0.84-1.15 (0.99±0.08), and was consistent with the theoretical value of 1 of no left-to-right shunt. Compared with the Qp/Qs ratios obtained from cardiac catheterization, no statistical difference was noted in the Qp/Qs ratios in ASD patients using VFM (2.18±0.48 vs 2.29±0.76, P>0.05) and spectral Doppler (2.30±0.91 vs 2.29±0.76, P>0.05), respectively. However, Qp/Qs ratios measured by VFM showed a higher correlation with the oximetric data compared with that measured by spectral doppler (r=0.71, P < 0.05 vs r=0.38, P <0.05). For VFM, an excellent reproducibility of Qp/Qs was observed with an inter- and intra-observer variability of 9.84% and 9.86%, respectively. Conclusions: VFM can visualize the right atrial flow filed in ASD patients precisely. Quantification of Qp/Qs using VFM is more accurate than spectral Doppler ultrasound.

84899445907	Correlation between the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 and 3 and hepatitis B virus: Possible roles in the resistance to interferon treatment	Background: The suppressor of cytokine signaling family (SOCS) is an important negative regulator in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This study was designed to explore the correlation between SOCS-1, 2 and 3, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and interferon (IFN), and the relationship between SOCS and IFN therapeutic efficacy. Methods. Four types of mouse models were established. Mice were administered with HBV replicative plasmid pHBV4.1 and IFN inducer Poly IC (Group A), pHBV4.1 (Group B), Poly IC (Group C) and saline (Group D), respectively. Liver tissues were harvested from the mice and SOCS expression was determined. Meanwhile, patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were treated with pegylated interferon -2b for 24-48 weeks. Liver biopsy was collected and the baseline SOCS expression was determined. Serum assay was performed for efficacy evaluation and correlation analysis. Results: In animal studies, the expression level of SOCS-1 and 3 was found in the descending order of B, A, C and D. The difference between Group B and D suggested that HBV could induce SOCS. The difference between Group A and C suggested that HBV could still induce SOCS with up-regulated endogenous IFN. The difference between Group C and D suggested that ploy IC could induce SOCS, while the difference between Group B and A suggested that Poly IC might have a stronger inhibition effect for SOCS. There was no difference in SOCS-2 expression. In clinical studies, eight of twenty-four enrolled patients achieved either complete or partial therapeutic response. The expression of both SOCS-1 and 3 was higher in CHB patients than in normal controls. The baseline HBV-DNA level was positively correlated with SOCS-1 and 3. The age, viral genotype, HBVDNA, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 were found to be related to IFN efficacy. Conclusion: HBV could induce both SOCS-1 and 3 expression regardless of endogenous IFN level. Elevated IFN could directly up-regulate SOCS-1 and 3 expression, but it could also indirectly down-regulate SOCS-1 and 3 expression by inhibiting HBV replication. HBV might play a more important role in the SOCS up-regulation than IFN, a possible reason why patients with high HBV viral load encounter poor efficacy of IFN treatment. © 2014 Du et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84901236173	Optimization therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B	Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is currently medically managed with either interferon-alpha or one of the five nucleos(t)ide analogs. However, there are still a large number of CHB patients whose response to the above therapies remains less than satisfactory, and their incomplete or non-response to antiviral therapies has plagued clinicians worldwide. In recent years, a newly proposed optimization therapy has provided us with a new approach to solve this problem. The key points in this optimization therapy are to initiate antiviral therapy with an appropriate agent at the correct time point, and to adjust treatments in patients with poor early responses by adding a second agent or switching to another more potent agent. In this review, we summarize recent developments in optimization therapy for the treatment of CHB, and provide an outlook for future research in this field. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

84903994374	Liquid oral suspension adefovir dipivoxil (GS-02-526): An update on treatments for hepatitis B infection	Though the global epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infection has declined due to effective immunization, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a serious public health problem and there is still a need for more treatment options that are efficient, safe and simple for different kinds of CHB patients. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) liquid suspension (GS-02-526), as a new form of oral ADV, not only has competent antiviral efficacy, but is also more convenient for patients with swallowing difficulties or patients with impaired renal function requiring dosage adjustment. The clinical data evaluating the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of liquid suspension of ADV as well as its tablet are summarized in this article. The availability of liquid oral suspension of ADV would allow more patients to receive timely and reasonable antiviral treatments. © Informa UK, Ltd.

84904468072	Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in bicuspid aortic valves: Insights from a dedicated prospective study	Background: There is a paucity of data regarding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, which has been considered a relative contraindication. The aim of present study was to assess the feasibility, safety and outcomes of TAVI in this patient subset. Methods: Patients were selected according to prespecified criteria. Their procedural, hemodynamic and clinical outcomes were recorded according to standardized definitions. Results: Sixteen patients were enrolled (mean age, 73.3 ± 7.7 years; mean logistic EuroSCORE, 21.4 ± 12.0%). The CoreValve (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) implantation was achieved in 15 patients. Marginal moderate periprosthetic aortic regurgitation occurred in 1 patient, and an additional prosthetic valve (valve-in-valve) was required in another patient owing to severe paravalvular regurgitation. The overall device success rate, using the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 definition, was 81.2%. After the procedure, the mean pressure gradient and peak jet velocity reduced from 59.1 ± 12.8 mmHg and 4.8 ± 0.6 m/s to 11.8 ± 5.5 mmHg and 2.2 ± 0.6 m/s, respectively. The incidence of new pacemaker insertion was 43.8%. One patient died during hospitalization, thus the survival rate was 93.8% at 30 days and remained unchanged at a median follow-up of 353 days. Conclusions: TAVI using the CoreValve appears to be feasible, safe and lead to acceptable mid-term clinical outcomes in selected high-risk patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, but may be associated with relatively lower device success rate and increased risk for high-degree heart block.

84910007860	Clinical characteristics and current management of hepatitis B and C in China	AIM: To describe a population of outpatients in China infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), and assess their current management status. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional study of HBV- and/or HCV-infected patients was conducted from August to November, 2011 in western China. Patients ? 18 years of age with HBV and/or HCV infections who visited outpatient departments at 10 hospitals were evaluated, whether treated or not. Data were collected on the day of visit from medical records and patient interviews. RESULTS: A total 4010 outpatients were analyzed, including 2562 HBV-infected and 1406 HCV-infected and 42 HBV/HCV co-infected patients. The median duration of documented infection was 7.5 years in HBV-infected and 1.8 years in HCV-infected patients. Cirrhosis was the most frequent hepatic complication (12.2%), appearing in one-third of patients within 3 years prior to or at diagnosis. The HCV genotype was determined in only 10% of HCV-infected patients. Biopsy data were only available for 54 patients (1.3%). Antiviral medications had been received by 58.2% of patients with HBV infection and 66.6% with HCV infection. Nucleos(t)ide analogs were the major antiviral medications prescribed for HBV-infected patients (most commonly adefovir dipivoxil and lamivudine). Ribavirin + pegylated interferon was prescribed for two-thirds of HCV-infected patients. In the previous 12 mo, around one-fifth patients had been hospitalized due to HBV or HCV infection. CONCLUSION: This observational, real-life study has identified some gaps between clinical practice and guideline recommendations in China. To achieve better health outcomes, several improvements, such as disease monitoring and optimizing antiviral regimens, should be made to improve disease management.

0346736499	One-step on-column affinity refolding purification and functional analysis of recombinant human VDAC1	The outer mitochondrial membrane porin, voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC), is believed to play an important role in mediating mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, detailed structure-function studies of VDAC have been hindered by the difficulties to obtain a soluble, correctly folded, and fully active form of the recombinant VDAC and its mutant variants due to its transmembrane nature. Here we report a high-throughput one-step chromatographic procedure in purification of recombinant human VDAC1 (rhVDAC1) protein overexpressed in bacteria. The improved methodology could generate a large quantity of rhVDAC1 with correct folding in terms of the secondary structure, with full biological activities in mediating cytochrome c release and in interaction with Bcl-X

84922726409	New insight of Vitamin D in chronic liver diseases	BACKGROUND Vitamin D is a fat-soluble sterol derivative that is predominantly synthesized in the liver and has multiple functions. The accumulative data showed that the clinical manifestations and prognosis of chronic liver diseases are associated with serum Vitamin D levels. DATA SOURCES A PubMed and Google Scholar search using terms: "Vitamin D", "25(OH)D", "liver disease", "viral hepatitis", "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "liver fibrosis", "cirrhosis", "hepatocellular carcinoma" and "autoimmune liver disease" was performed, and relevant articles published in English between January 2000 and March 2014 were reviewed. Full-text publications relevant to the field were selected and relevant articles from reference lists were also included. RESULTS The insufficiency or deficiency of Vitamin D is common in various kinds of chronic liver diseases including viral hepatitis B and C. Serum 25-hydroxyVitamin D and Vitamin D receptors are possibly interrelated with the incidence, treatment and prognosis of diseases. Though the evidence of Vitamin D supplementation in viral hepatitis and associated liver diseases is still limited, there is great potential to apply this adjuvant therapy to improve the treatments. CONCLUSIONS Although the exact role and mechanisms of Vitamin D have not been fully elucidated in chronic liver diseases, it is potentially beneficial in the treatment of chronic liver diseases. Further mechanistic studies are needed to validate its clinical application. (Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int 2014;13:580-585)
