33846614213	Modeling and simulation of magnetic resonance imaging based on intermolecular multiple quantum coherences	Intermoleeular multiple quantum coherences (iMQCs) have many potential applications since they can provide interaction information between different molecules within the range of dipolar correlation distance, and can provide new contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because of the non-localized property of dipolar field, and the non-linear property of the Bloch equations incorporating the dipolar field term, the evolution behavior of iMQC is difficult to deduce strictly in many cases. In such cases, simulation studies are very important. Simulation results can not only give a guide to optimize experimental conditions, but also help analyze unexpected experimental results. Based on our product operator matrix and the K-space method for dipolar field calculation, the MRI simulation software was constructed, running on Windows operation system. The non-linear Bloch equations are calculated by a fifth-order Cash-Karp Runge-Kutta formulism. Computational time can be efficiently reduced by separating the effects of chemical shifts and strong gradient field. Using this software, simulation of different kinds of complex MRI sequences can be done conveniently and quickly on general personal computers. Some examples were given. The results were discussed.

77954267990	Real-time evaluation model for the transmission quality of under water image	The paper proposes a real-time image quality evaluation model, which is based on the VQM quality evaluation system. The model is suitable for underwater and wireless applications. The model adopts three parameters, i. e. structure error, energy augment and energy expense, to describe the distortion of the compressed or uncompressed images; and the evaluation model has good evaluation veracity, monotonicity and consistency. The model also takes the advantage of compressing the order of the singular value, which reduces the information of the reference feature, saves the channel resource and provides a new approach to realize real-time evaluation. Research shows that the additional signal cost does not exceed 3% of the total information, so this method is suitable for the applications like underwater acoustic communication or wireless communication with limited channel resource. Besides, the paper also proposes a model that uses triangle image to express the image quality, which overcomes the shortcoming of the confusion in quality score. Experiment shows that the proposed model could be widely used in underwater image communication applications, such as underwater inspection, sea exploration and so on.

84867010722	Effective driver fatigue Monitoring through pupil detection and yawing analysis in low light level environments	Monitoring driver fatigue is an important method to improving transportation safety. The statistics shows that a number of transportation accidents are caused by driver fatigue. A system which can monitor driver fatigue and issue warning timely will help in preventing many accidents, and consequently reduce personal suffering and save money greatly. Driver fatigue detection are the subject of intense research today. However, effective driver fatigue monitoring in low light level environments has been challenging since it is difficult to get the exactly state of the driver. This paper have made an attempt to design a system that uses video camera that points directly towards the driver's pupil and yawning in order to detect fatigue. With IR illuminator, the system works robustly in low light level environments. If the fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. The authors have worked on the video files recorded by the camera. Video file is converted into frames. To begin with, a method based on Ada-Boost is adopted to locate the face and eyes through the driver's picture. Then we introduce a new method to identify eyes' state and yawning detection. Finally the driver's state is monitored by PERCLOS algorithm. If the driver fatigue state are detected for 6 consecutive frames, the system draws the conclusion that the driver is falling asleep and issues a warning signal. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed system and algorithm can achieve satisfactory performance.

In order to get a better location result, we firstly analysised the environment in the water tank and modeled it in this paper. Using long time observation, the successive time-variant impulse response and the statistical parameters changing is obtained. All these parameters can effectively avoid multipath (indirect) signals which can be mistaken for the direct signal that would affect the positioning system for a relative positioning system. Compared with the absolute positioning systems, the relative positioning systems don't need an external infrastructure. Only the distances between the buoys are used to obtain their position. The results showed that using LFM signal can get the stable location result. Meanwhile the positioning system is easy on the equipments which has great application future for the specific environment, such as the animal breeding and dolphin protection. © 2012 IEEE.

84867088471	Impulsive noise suppression and signal distortion effect mitigation in underwater acoustic OFDM system	OFDM is a high date rate underwater acoustic transmission scheme even for underwater acoustic communication. OFDM modulation scheme has many obvious advantages. It have been widely studied to overcome the complexity of underwater acoustic channels. Impulsive noise is one of the major impairments for communication over underwater acoustic channels. When it occurs, it is very destructive and results in dropping the affected symbols at the receiver. Generally speaking, OFDM modulation method is less sensitive to impulsive noise than single-carrier systems. Nevertheless, it was recently recognized that this advantage turns into a disadvantage if the impulsive noise energy exceeds a certain threshold. In this paper, the nonlinear clipping methods for impulsive noise suppression in underwater acoustic OFDM system is considered and soft compensation is employed for signal clipping effect mitigation. The experimental results are provided to verify the proposal. It is shown that with the proposed method, a good trade-off between impulsive noise suppression and signal clipping distortion mitigation can be achieved.

56349093986	Subband method for wideband adaptive beamforming	A subband method with general-parameter-filter banks (GPFB) for wideband array adaptive beamforming is proposed. The received wideband signal is divided into multiple subband signals by the analytical filter bank. Each of the subband signals is then fed into its corresponding subband array processor, of which the outputs are combined by the synthesis filter bank and recovered into wideband signal. As subbands are running at down-sampling rate and in parallel manner, the loads of computational processing can be effectively alleviated, and the efficiency of array improved. The simulation results show that the convergence speed of weights and deep suppression of the interference are enhanced with the subband method except for a little worse mean square error (MSE) of the output signal. In addition, compared to the subband method using quadrature-mirror-filter (QMF) banks with the same number of channels, this method possesses a superior ability of interference suppression, and it is also capable of reducing the MSE significantly.

At first, image of the temporal derivative would be changed into the histogram domain, and then the statistic calculation (RMS and so on) was done for the temporal information. The drawback of the conventional method was overcome whose workload would increase greatly with the increase of the number of the pixel in scene image. Experimental results show that the computation complexity is dependent on the gray level of histogram, but is independent of the number of the pixel by the new method. In the same experiment condition, the computational efficiency is improved three times while the performance is similar to the conventional method.

77951206932	Kernel-based nonlinear discriminant analysis using minimum squared errors criterion for multiclass and undersampled problems	It is well known that there exist two fundamental limitations in the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). One is that it cannot be applied when the within-class scatter matrix is singular, which is caused by the undersampled problem. The other is that it lacks the capability to capture the nonlinearly clustered structure of the data due to its linear nature. In this paper, a new kernel-based nonlinear discriminant analysis algorithm using minimum squared errors criterion (KDA-MSE) is proposed to solve these two problems. After mapping the original data into a higher-dimensional feature space using kernel function, the MSE criterion is used as the discriminant rule and the corresponding dimension reducing transformation is derived. Since the MSE solution does not require the scatter matrices to be nonsingular, the proposed KDA-MSE algorithm is applicable to the undersampled problem. Moreover, the new KDA-MSE algorithm can be applied to multiclass problem, whereas the existing MSE-based kernel discriminant methods are limited to handle twoclass data only. Extensive experiments, including object recognition and face recognition on three benchmark databases, are performed and the results demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive in comparison with other kernel-based discriminant techniques in terms of recognition accuracy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

79953223719	μ-PMLE: A fast approach to estimating loss performance	Loss tomography, as a key component of network tomography, aims to obtain the loss rates of each link in a network by end-to-end measurements. Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) method is often used in loss tomography to identity the link loss rates. But the MLE method relies on the iterative approximation to identity the loss rate that requires a long execution time, and the solution identified by the MLE method may not be the global maximum since it may trap into a optimum. Pseudo Maximum Likelihood Estimation (PMLE) method is simply and fast because it is a analytical solution, but it can not estimate the link loss rates accurately. In this paper, we propose a new fast method (μ-PMLE) by explicit estimation for loss tomography. The μ-PMLE method employs a correction factor μ to estimate the link loss rates accurately. Comparing to the previous PMLE methods, the simulation results show that the estimated link loss rates using μ-PMLE method match the real loss rates better.

84863085233	Unique word based channel estimation for DFT-spread OFDM transmission over underwater acoustics channels	High-speed underwater acoustic communication has been challenging due to the ocean environment characteristics which can be summarized as simultaneously excessive multipath delay, severe Doppler-drift, attenuation and limited bandwidth. Multi-carrier modulation is a potential alternative for underwater acoustic communication. Nevertheless, the conventional block-type pilot based channel estimation method for multi-carrier modulation is susceptible to the rapid-time varying channels,and the performance will decline sharply. In this study, a novel unique word (UW) based channel estimation was proposed and applied to DFT-Spread OFDM transmission over underwater acoustic channels. The method is operated by a frequency domain feed forward equalization and a time domain decision adaptive equalization through double UW blocks. Simulations showed significant improvement in bit-error-rate of our proposal. Further, a systematic investigation including testing and evaluation, in the experimental pool in Xiamen University and the shallow water near Xiamen, showed that the UW based method achieved much better BER performance than conventional block-type pilot based method for DFT-Spread OFDM system. The study demonstrated that UW based channel estimation would be applicable for DFT-Spread OFDM system over underwater acoustic channels.

84864231062	The study on time-variant characteristics of under water acoustic channels	With the characteristics of high ambient noise level, very narrow bandwidth, low carrier frequency, enormous propagation latency and time-space-frequency variant multipath effect, the stochastic ocean channel is very complex and difficult to achieve reliable UWA communications. The study of transmission characteristics is an important but weak link in underwear acoustic communication technology, so the study of underwater acoustic channel model has a very important practical significance. In this paper, based on conventional ray theory we have established N-path deterministic model, while taking advantage of BELLHOP, and introducing WSSUS channel model for shallow UWA channel transmission characteristics, and also have improved a shallow UWA time-variant channel model testing system performance. Comparing with the deterministic model, Simulation results show that the model is more intuitive and realistic. © 2012 IEEE.

84866146453	Iterative block DFE for underwater acoustic single carrier system	In order to gain a better performance and reduce the computational complexity of the filter design in the underwater acoustic single carrier system, a new Iterative Block DFE (IBDFE) is proposed, which operates iteratively on blocks of the received signal, and fully implements its filtering operations by Discrete Fourier Trans-forms (DFTs). Two design methods are considered for IBDFE: one is HD-IBDFE, and the other is SD-IBDFE. In this paper, the first one is adopted. In this scheme, hard detected data are used as input of the feedback, and filters are designed according to the correlation between detected and transmitted data. In the simulations and experiments, the method of the HD-IBDFE is in-troduced, and for comparison, the performance of H-DFE is shown, as well as that of ZF, MMSE and Matched-Filter-Bound (MFB). From the results of the simulations on a Rayleigh fading channel, it is easily found that on average, the HD-IBDFE outperforms H-DFE. When the number of iteration is 4, HD-IBDFE outperforms ZF, MMSE and H-DFE by about 11 dB, 5 dB and 0.7 dB respectively at BER=10

84880276030	EHM: A novel efficient protocol based handshaking mechanism for underwater acoustic sensor networks	Underwater Media Access Control (MAC) protocol design faces more challenges due to the unique characteristics of acoustic communication such as the long propagation delay and limited bandwidth. The long propagation delay in underwater causes the hidden terminal and spatially unfair problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient MAC protocol for multi-hop underwater acoustic sensor networks, which we shall call the EHM - Efficient Handshaking Mechanism. It is a handshaking-based protocol that addresses the hidden terminal and spatially unfair problem, and the EHM protocol can improve the channel utilization by allowing a node to receive data packets from multiple potential senders simultaneously. This method can reduce the relative proportion of time spent on control packets. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated via simulations. Experiment results show that the EHM protocol outperforms in channel utilization, fairness of transmission and end-to-end packets delay. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84880348715	AGC design in frequency modulation system for voice communication via underwater acoustic channel	The FM modulation improves the anti-interference ability by sacrificing the bandwidth of the communication channel. In the underwater acoustic communication, as the bandwidth of the communication channel is very limited, the theory and experiment study show that if we are not deal with the original signal, the modulated signal cannot be transmitted through the underwater channel. In the research of underwater FM system, we find a better way to filtering and AGC. Adding filtering and AGC can not only control the bandwidth of the modulated signal but also improve the anti-noise ability integrally. © 2013 by IFSA.

84883698285	Quality evaluation method for underwater image communication	A simulation based on Gilbert-Elliot packet loss model is developed to simulate an image transmitting system in underwater acoustic channel. This developed system is applied as a platform to study the relation between image quality assessment parameter PSNR, image activity measure (IAM) and channel's packet loss rate. A group of sample images were transmitted in this communication system and a formula of PSNR, the initial value of IAM, and packet loss rate was fitted by the data from the degraded sample images. With the help of the fitted formula, then we are able to predict the possible quality of image transmission, and beforehand choices of channel or source processing techniques in the communication system becomes possible, too.

84896095527	Cross layer design for localization in large-scale underwater sensor networks	There are many technical challenges for designing large-scale underwater sensor networks, especially the sensor node localization. Although many papers studied for large-scale sensor node localization, previous studies mainly study the location algorithm without the cross layer design for localization. In this paper, by utilizing the network hierarchical structure of underwater sensor networks, we propose a new large-scale underwater acoustic localization scheme based on cross layer design. In this scheme, localization is performed in a hierarchical way, and the whole localization process focused on the physical layer, data link layer and application layer. We increase the pipeline parameters which matched the acoustic channel, added in MAC protocol to increase the authenticity of the large-scale underwater sensor networks, and made analysis of different location algorithm. We conduct extensive simulations, and our results show that MAC layer protocol and the localization algorithm all would affect the result of localization which can balance the trade-off between localization accuracy, localization coverage, and communication cost. © 2014 IFSA Publishing, S.

The aim is to solve the problem of large feedback overhead for channel state information (CSI) in every subcarrier. A novel CSI feedback scheme is proposed based on the theory of compressed sensing (CS). We propose a feedback from the receiver that only feedback the sparse channel parameters. Additionally, prediction of the channel state is proposed every several symbols to realize the AM in practice. We describe a linear channel prediction algorithm which is used in adaptive transmission. This system has been tested in the real underwater acoustic channel. The linear channel prediction makes the AM transmission techniques more feasible for acoustic channel communications. The simulation and experiment show that significant improvements can be obtained both in bit error rate (BER) and throughput in the AM scheme compared with the fixed Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation scheme. Moreover, the performance with standard CS outperforms the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) method. © 2014 Chinese Ocean Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The CFO and impulse noise could be estimated by using the null subcarriers. The null subcarriers estimation included optimal separate estimation and joint estimation. The separate estimation firstly estimated the CFO value and then estimated the impulse noise value. However, the CFO and impulse noise are always affected each other when one of them was estimated. Then a joint optimal estimation was proposed to estimate the both of them. Experimental results performed with numerical simulation and pool-trial data are provided. The results show the improvement of the proposed algorithm under time-varying channels and the joint estimation can get more performance gain margin than the separate estimation about 3 dB at the BER of 10

84904741761	Cooperative-adaptive real-time tracking for moving targets in underwater networks	Since position information of moving targets is crucial for underwater applications, there has been a growing interest in effective localization and tracking strategies. For location-based decision applications, such as early warning systems, vehicle navigation and control, adaptive sampling and formation control, real-time position estimate is the key point for system operation. Hence motivated by these scenarios, we focus on real-time tracking for multiple moving targets in underwater networks and propose a cooperative-adaptive real-time tracking algorithm based on partial factor graph. By means of adaptive adjustment mechanism, this algorithm can construct partial factor graph with appropriate length over time and thus adaptively trade off localization accuracy and real-time requirement to obtain best estimation. Besides, in combination with cooperative estimate, the accuracy in position estimate is further improved. With real sea-trial data imported, simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement in position estimation, compared with the other two schemes, classic TDoA (time difference of arrival) based localization and adaptive tracking scheme without cooperative estimate. © 2014 Binary Information Press.

84904753901	A novel adaptive real-time tracking scheme for underwater networks	Location information of mobile submersibles is critical to underwater networks. A considerable amount of researches have been carried out on non-real-time tracking to suffice many scenarios, while the lack of real-time tracking motivates more efforts to be addressed in Real-time underwater applications. In this paper a novel adaptive Real-time tracking scheme is presented, which can adaptively adjust the length of factor graph and then construct the resulting partial factor graph to track the positions of mobile submersibles. Since the proposed scheme tailors the basic factor graph into a partial factor graph with much shorter length in time, it makes the Real-time tracking feasible. Meanwhile, adaptively constructing the appropriate partial factor graph according to accuracy requirement of localization, can obtain high accuracy for localization and tracking. Simulation results using real sea-trail data show that our proposed scheme can adaptively trade off Real-time requirement and localization accuracy, achieving 12% to 61% improvement for tracking performance in the corresponding scenarios, when comparing with the classic TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) localization method. 1548-7741/Copyright © 2014 Binary Information Press.

84906786932	A survey on MAC protocols for underwater wireless sensor networks	Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are expected to support a variety of civilian and military applications. In UWSNs, Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has attracted strong attention due to its potentially large impact to the overall network performance. Unlike terrestrial networks, which mainly rely on radio waves for communications, UWSNs utilize acoustic waves, which pose a new research challenge in the design of MAC protocols. To present the development of MAC protocols in UWSNs, this paper surveys the current state-of-the-art MAC protocols for UWSNs. In the early development, the performance in terms of delay and throughput of the UWSNs has been the major concern of the MAC layer protocol design. Later, the design of energy-efficient MAC protocols becomes a new research focus because sensor nodes are generally powered by batteries which are less likely to be recharged. In this paper, we first describe the underwater acoustic environment and the challenges to the MAC protocols design in UWSNs. We then provide a comparative study of several types of MAC protocols according to current existing diverse implementations. Furthermore, open research issues will be summarized. Hopefully, this survey will inspire more active research in this area. © 2014 IEEE.
