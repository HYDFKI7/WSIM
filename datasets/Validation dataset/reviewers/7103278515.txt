27744544888	AERA algorithm on speech hiding system	This paper presents a speech-hiding algorithm - Analysis-By-Synthesis Energy Ratio Adjust Algorithm (AERAA) that can be deployed on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The algorithm is based on the technique of Analysis-By-Synthesis (ABS) and can adjust adaptively the strength of the security information component according to public speech. The hiding capacity of the algorithm is 50 bits per second. After a lot of experiments, it is proved that this algorithm has strong robustness to many attacks such as Regular Pulse Excited-Long Term Prediction coding (RPE-LTP coding) on GSM, Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) compression and most of filters. The average Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) of the middle speech is above 37 db, therefore the imperceptibility can be ensured. Moreover the algorithm is based on blind-detection, it is simple and effective.

33846510456	Biometric-based personal identity-authentication system and security analysis	The traditional authentication system is based on the secret key, and is mainly based on public key infrastructure (PKI). Unfortunately, a key has many disadvantages, for example, the key can be forgotten or stolen, and can be easily cracked. Nowadays, authentication systems using biometric technology have become more prevalent because of the advantages over password-based authentication systems. In this article, several biometric authentication models are presented, upon which most biometric authentication systems are based. Biometric authentication systems based-on these models provide high security for access control in non-face-to-face environment such as e-commerce, over open network.

34548299804	Improved remote user authentication scheme preserving user anonymity	Most of smart card-based remote authentication schemes proposed didn 't protect the users ' identities while authenticating the users, even though user anonymity is an important issue in many e-commerce applications. In 2004, Das et al. proposed a remote authentication scheme to authenticate users while preserving the users ' anonymity. Their scheme adopted dynamic identification to achieve this function. Then in 2005, Chien and Chen pointed out Das et al. 's scheme fails to protect the user's anonymity and proposed a new remote authentication scheme preserving user anonymity. This paper, however, will demonstrate that Chien and Chen's scheme has also some problems: it cannot resist strong masquerading server/user attack, insider attack, denial of service attack and restricted replay attack; it also has the problem of slow wrong password detection. Therefore, an improved scheme is proposed to conquer these problems. © 2007 IEEE.

38049056199	A simple authentication and key distribution protocol in wireless mobile networks	Plenty of applications and services for personal communications in wireless mobile networks (WMN) are brought up recently, such as mobile commerce applications and teleconference applications. So the end-to-end security requirements are necessary. Nevertheless WMN don't offer end-to-end confidentiality and integrity mechanism for personal communications. The linchpin of end-to-end security is the authentication of users. Considering the limited wireless bands and the limited computing ability of mobile devices, we present a simple authentication and key distribution protocol (SAKDP) for end-to-end secure communications. Based on symmetric cryptography and one-way function techniques, SAKDP is satisfied with secure requirements of wireless end-to-end secure communication, also enables dynamic secure communications. The proposed scheme also has identity anonymity and encryption key renewal mechanism, its computation cost and transmission cost are smaller. © 2007 IEEE.

0033155595	Wavelet based approach for joint time delay and doppler stretch measurements	A new wavelet-based algorithm for joint time delay and Doppler stretch estimation in passive radar, sonar, and GPS applications is described. By taking the cross wavelet transform of the noisy outputs from two spatially separated sensors, the wideband cross ambiguity function (WBCAF) can be computed. This in turn provides a direct measurement of the time difference and Doppler stretch between the two signals. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived and the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. It is found that the theoretical variances of the estimates are unbiased and approach the CRLB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In order to improve the accuracy of the estimation under noisy environment, a simple denoising method is introduced. Simulation results are given to corroborate the analysis. © 1999 IEEE.

58049100042	An efficient fair payment protocol in mobile DRM	The presented mobile DRM are short of an efficient payment protocol to guarantee that participants can engage in the exchange without the risk of suffering a disadvantage. Even the latest DRM standard of the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) did not give a detailed transaction scheme in mobile DRM. In general, the fair payment approaches in mobile DRM rely on the service of an external trusted third party (TTP) or add the fees to the phone bill which renders the TTP a bottleneck or just adapts to micro-billing. Therefore, referring to the architecture of OMA DRM, in this article we present a practical fair payment protocol in mobile DRM without TTP by using the concurrent signature scheme. In this protocol, the keystone embedded in the input of protocol by the customer, and if not revealed, the protocol has the deniability; otherwise the transcript of protocol is binding for the identification. So, it reduces the cost of all parties' computation and decreases the communication passes. This protocol is analyzed and compared with other payment protocols used in mobile DRM, the results show that the proposed payment protocol satisfies the requirements of the fair e-transaction and its communication cost and customer's computation are reduced significantly. © 2008 IEEE.

77954509200	Querying encrypted character data in DAS model	There has been increasing concern about Database-as-a-Service(DAS) architectures. In the DAS model, the conventional scheme for query over encrypted data in database is to construct efficient index in database. This can ensure query efficiency. However, the fuzzy search is often used in the query of character data. It will be very tough owing to data encryption. Even the tiny changes of plaintext, the ciphtext will be quite distinct. Therefore, it is crucial to construct efficient index of encrypted character strings. To address these problems, a cryptographic scheme of character data in relational database is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the char or varchar data type and c10b data type will be considered respectively. For the data of char or varchar type, an index based double filtration is established. The index includes two parts: the first part of index is used to determine the set of existed characters in original string, and the second part stores the characteristic value of the characters' positions. The first part of index implements the first filtration, which will filter all the records include inaccurate characters. The second part of index is used to verify the positions of character strings. It's the second filtration. For the data of clob type, instead of the original character data, the positions of all the character strings will be stored. This scheme avoids needless decryption and data transfer. Consequently, better query efficiency is achieved and fuzzy search is well supported. ©2010 IEEE.

Firstly, the condition satisfying the reversibility of dynamic DC-QIM is deduced. Then, the allowable range of DC parameter is derived. Finally, the procedure of reversible data hiding algorithm based on dynamic DC-QIM is designed. Its data hiding rate can achieve as high as 1bpp in a single iteration, higher than its former counterparts. Furthermore, the use of dynamic characteristic is in favor of preventing its parameters from being disclosed. Experimental results show that it not only accurately decodes the secret information, but also perfectly restores the original cover, regardless of initial conditions.

Accordingly, a semi-supervised ensemble approach for mining data streams is presented in this paper. Data streams are divided into data chunks to deal with the infinite length. An ensemble classification model E is trained with existing labeled data chunks and decision boundary is constructed using E for detecting novel classes. New labeled data chunks are used to update E while unlabeled ones are used to construct unsupervised models. Classes are predicted by a semi-supervised model Ex which is consist of E and unsupervised models in a maximization consensus manner, so better performance can be achieved by using the constraints from unsupervised models with limited labeled instances.

84887316381	Attribute based DRM scheme with efficient revocation in cloud computing	The existing digital rights management (DRM) schemes in cloud computing introduce a heavy computation overhead on the content provider for key distribution. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based DRM scheme in cloud computing by combining the techniques of ciphertextpolicy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and proxy reencryption (PRE). We first divide the content encryption key into two parts, content master key and assistant key. Then we enforce access policies based on attributes to distribute the content master key securely. Thus the users who satisfy the access policy can recover the content master key, and then obtain assistant key from the key server and decrypt the content. Furthermore, we achieve efficient attribute and user revocation by allowing the attribute authority to delegate the key server to refuse to issue the assistant key for the revoked users. The security and performance analyses indicate that the proposed scheme is secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

Furthermore, the length of the signature and the computational effort are independent of the number of the group members and the revoked members, so the new scheme is more suitable for large group and the group with members' heavy updates.

In order to overcome the drawback, a multi-purpose dual watermark algorithm is proposed in the paper, taking advantage of the stability of singular values. It divides the original image into several blocks, and inserts robust watermark into their singular values. Then it inserts the fragile watermark into LSB in the space domain of previous watermarked image. Moreover, it designs a rule to distinguish malicious tamper from unintentional tamper. It tests not only robust watermark's robustness towards attacks, but also fragile watermark's influence towards robustness as well as the ability to tamper detection and localization. The experimental results show that the robust watermark possesses strong robustness to resist attacks, and that the fragile watermark is very sensitive to tamper and has good accuracy of tamper localization. Therefore it can achieve copyright protection and content authentication at the same time.

62949200945	Trust propagation policy for secure interoperability in multi-domain environments	Access control is one of the most important issues of secu re in teroperability b etween domain s. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a technology that has been proposed as an alternative approach to traditional access control mechanisms both to simplify the task of access control administration and to directly support function-based access control. This model maps users to roles and roles to permissions, making policy authorization simplified since the amount of roles are much fewer than users. Role hierarchies are the RBAC relevant extensions and they alsoare instrumental in reducing the complexity of role and authorization specification. In this paper, a framework for a multi-domain environment where RBAC policies have been employed is provided. Then,the theory of Hierarchical RBAC and modeling Hierarchical RBAC using role graphs are discussed in detail;Finally role hierarchy governing read and write access to objects are studied via an example. © 2008 IEEE.

With crack being the main distress in the actual pavement surface, digital image processing has been widely applied to cracking recognition recently. Since most cracks in actual pavement surface images are disconnected and unclear, image processing methods on pixel or connected domain level couldn't identify cracks correctly and entirely.

69849091271	Efficient provable secure ID-based directed signature scheme without random oracle	As a special signature, a directed signature is a type of signature with verification ability which is restricted. In a directed signature scheme, a designated verifier can exclusively verify the validity of a signature. If necessary, the designated verifier or the signer can prove the correction of a signature to a third party. Directed signature schemes are suitable for applications such as bill of tax and bill of health. In this paper, an ID-based directed signature scheme without random oracle is proposed by combining ID-based cryptology with Waters signature. We also give the syntax and security notion of ID-based directed signature without random oracle: unforgeability and invisiblity. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme is unforgeable under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption, and invisible under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

70249117153	Audio steganography by quantization index modulation in the DCT domain	Audio signal has more information redundancy than image signal, but its randomicity is stronger. It is more challenge to extract embedded bit with non-error from audio. A novel audio steganography based on QIM (quantization index modulation) in the DCT (discrete cosine transform) domain was proposed. The merits of the algorithm were as follows: based on the principle of QIM, the message was embedded by quantization method and was extracted by the mapping between message bit and quantization interval. The extraction was executed blindly; the robustness of the hidden message was ensured well by the improved QIM, which employed the error-tolerance operation during embedding and extracting; the capacity was large as 357.6bit/s. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better imperceptivity than normal QIM and the SNR (signal to noise ratio) of the stego audio with the embedding rate of 100% is above 30dB. The embedded message has good robustness against MP3 compression, requantization, resampling and lowpass filtering. Moreover, the algorithm is easy to implement and highly practicable.

This paper proposed a new steganalysis technique which aims at LSB matching embedding based on the local area's correlation in grayscale images. The detection method defines the correlation between regional pixels as the difference between the sum of 8-neighbor pixels and the central pixel. The existence of embedded information can be detected by observing the change of the regional correlation before and after embedding. Compared with the existing algorithms, the advantages of the proposed method includes simplicity, computational efficiency and low false positive rate.

70450278717	Novel key management for 3G end-to-end encryption	People increasingly depend on the mobile communication networks, specially the third generation of mobile communication network (3G), to transmit data with one another. Although 3G networks implement data confidentiality and integrity within network components, but don't offer user's end-to-end confidentiality and integrity. End-to-end encryption could improve these vulnerabilities, and facilitates many security applications. The linchpin of end-to-end encryption is how to efficiently manage every key. A novel key management scheme is presented in this paper, fully using the speciality of 3 G, which bases on three-party Diffie-Hellman key negotiation algorithm. It almost needs no modifications of the structure of 3 G except that new software is added. Because the scheme needs no extra shared secret, it reduces the key storage of User Equipments (UE) and Authentication Centre to O(1). In addition, the troubles of the preassignment of shared secret and key update are omitted, and the mutual authentication and the lawful interception are provided.

The wide range of selection and the high degree of strangeness bring lots of problems in secure selection of grid. Efficient resource allocation and utilization can hardly be achieved without the assurance of a high degree of confidence relation. In this paper, we propose a solution based on trust mechanism.

We assume that TP is semi-honest, i.e., TP executes the protocol loyally, keeps a record of all its intermediate computations and might try to steal the players' private inputs from the record, but he cannot be corrupted by the adversary. The security of this protocol with respect to various kinds of attacks is discussed. Our protocol utilizes the triplet entangled states and the simple single-particle measurement. The particles carried the secret messages do not be repeatedly transmitted. The players' messages are divided into many groups. Sometimes, the protocol is already successfully completed, but all data are not compared. Thus, many time and huge quantum resources can be saved. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data security is the overriding concern in DAS, and encryption is a natural solution. However, queries over encrypted databases are usually inefficient due to a heap of time on the encryption and decryption. In this paper, we present an encryption scheme and XQuery translation model of XML database. The major work and contribution of this paper are as below: 1) Splitting method is proposed in the encryption scheme, in which more flexible encryption granularity is obtained. 2) We put forward the encryption strategy that, by encrypting two or more fragments together, is efficient to resist various kinds of database attack owing to the changed ciphertext distribution and data size by splitting. 3) An XQuery translation model is introduced, by converting the query of XML data into that of relational data, combined with XML Schemas Compression and hash technology, which perform the XQuery language efficiently. Our experimental evaluation shows that our XML database encryption and query model achieves both excellent query efficiency and robust security. ©2009 IEEE.

77952319575	Conjugate adjoining problem in braid groups and new design of braid-based signatures	The development of quantum computation casts serious threats to the securities of most existing public-key cryptosystems. Braid-based cryptography is one of the alternatives that have potential advantages in resisting quantum attacks. In this paper, the state of the art of braid cryptography is surveyed, and then a new cryptographic problem-conjugate adjoining problem related to braid groups is proposed. Based on this problem, we design a new braid-based signature scheme. This scheme is efficient and provably secure in the random oracle model. Further, we present the comparison between braid-based signatures and RSA-based ones. The signing process of the braid-based schemes is more efficient than that of RSA-based ones, while the verifying process of the braid-based ones is observably slow. Hence, braid-based signatures are suitable for scenarios where the signing process has to be as quick as possible but delays are permitted in the verifying process, for example, in off-line e-cash systems. The key sizes in braid-based schemes are considerably large-about 2K bits in the case of secret keys and 12K bits in the case of public keys. However, braid operations are much simpler and more efficient than modular exponential operations. Therefore, braid-based schemes can be embedded into devices with low computational ability and large memory space. The capability of braid cryptosystems to resist currently known quantum attacks is also discussed from the perspective of hidden subgroup problems. © 2010 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Comparing with the previous quantum steganographies, the capacity of the hidden channel is much higher, which is increased to eight bits. Meanwhile, due to the quantum uncertainty theorem and the no-cloning theorem its imperceptibility is proved to be great in the analysis, and its security is also analyzed in detail, which is proved that intercept-resend attack, measurement-resend attack, ancilla attack, man-in-the-middle attack or even Dos(Denial of Service) attack couldn't threaten it. As a result, the protocol can be applied in various fields of quantum communication. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79953029186	Modeling dynamics of disaster spreading in community networks	In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of disaster spreading in community networks. Unlike the case in other kinds of complex networks, the transitions between the self-healing and spreading dynamics for community networks are in ladder-type in dependent of the recovery time and time delay. Statistical analysis on the average erupting time of disaster in communities shows that large-scale disaster firstly erupts in the community with maximal average degree, which is unrelated with the location where the initial disturbance seed is. Moreover, the average erupting time of disaster reduces along with the decrease of the average degrees of communities. Therefore, the community structure is helpful on the control of the disaster spreading. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79959291543	Research of spatial domain image digital watermarking payload	Watermarking payload is a topic in which the watermarking researchers have a great interest at present. Based on the constraint of perceptual invisibility, this paper makes a study of the maximum watermarking payload of spatial domain image, which is related to not only embedding intensity, but also to factors such as the size of image, image roughness and visual sensitivity, and so forth. The correlation among the maximum payload and the embedding intensity and size of an image is theoretically deduced through the objective estimation indicator of the peak signal to the noise rate (PSNR) while the relationship model among watermarking payload and image roughness and visual sensitivity is deduced through effective experiments designed on the basis of subjective estimation indicators. Finally, taking all these relationship models into account, this paper proposes a watermarking payload estimation method and verifies its effectiveness through experiments. © 2011 Mao Jia-Fa et al.

Computer generate hologram (CGH) is implemented to record multiple images simultaneously into an encrypted hologram. Because its two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transform (FT) result is analogous a partial 3D Fourier transform sampling, the 2D FT result can be compressed by a nonuniform sampling accompanied with a quantization. The encryption and compression processes agrees with the requirement of the compressive sensing and composes the compressive holography. Therefore, the decryption is solved by a minimization. It remains the sparsity of the recovered natural images in the wavelet basis. Meanwhile, a total-variation regularization and a nonnegative constraint is employed to extract images with edge preserved and nonnegative gray scale, respectively.

This paper, based on the matrix singular value decomposition in contourlet domain, suggests an adaptive watermarking scheme that embodies four major algorithms including watermark preprocessing, HVS masking computation, watermark embedding and extracting.

84865730216	Efficient and secure RFID mutual authentication protocol without sharing key	Many RFID authentication protocols have been proposed in recent years. However, most existing protocols have a common problem that in order to identify only one single tag they require a linear computational complexity on the back-end server side. This problem makes use of the protocols impractical in large-scale RFID systems. Besides, some authentication protocols utilize the way of key updating to realize tracking protection, yet synchronization becomes a possible vulnerability for these protocols. Although various methods for blocking the synchronization attack are proposed, all of them require a large amount of memory and high computation complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual authentication protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography. Tag, reader and back-end server does not share any key in our protocol, then there does not exist synchronization attack and needn't exhaustive compute. Furthermore, the proposed protocol requires only three cryptographic operations to authenticate one tag. Analysis shows that the proposed protocol is secure, and it is more suitable to meet future RFID system demands.

Most of current DRM systems were built up in centered authorization mode which can work efficiently in normal case, but once the DRM administrator is unauthentic or the server collapsed, it will not provide authentication and authorization service again. In this paper, a verifiable threshold authorization scheme (VETAS) based on ellipse curve cryptosystem (ECC) and Lagrange polynomial is adopted for scalable and robust digital rights management, in which authorization was based on t-out of n qualified members, less than t members cannot implement authorization, and the system can still work well once part of the members are unauthentic. The advantage of the VETAS scheme is that it works in a "mutual authentication and threshold authorization" mode, thus end-user and the authorization center can authenticate each other to enhance security of corresponding identity, another advantage of the VETAS scheme is it can provide real-time rights management with fairly good robustness and reliability in a threshold authorization mode. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

84883156696	High-efficiency quantum steganography based on the tensor product of Bell states	In this paper, we first propose a hidden rule among the secure message, the initial tensor product of two Bell states and the final tensor product when respectively applying local unitary transformations to the first particle of the two initial Bell states, and then present a high-efficiency quantum steganography protocol under the control of the hidden rule. In the proposed quantum steganography scheme, a hidden channel is established to transfer a secret message within any quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) scheme that is based on 2-level quantum states and unitary transformations. The secret message hiding/unhiding process is linked with the QSDC process only by unitary transformations. To accurately describe the capacity of a steganography scheme, a quantitative measure, named embedding efficiency, is introduced in this paper. The performance analysis shows that the proposed steganography scheme achieves a high efficiency as well as a good imperceptibility. Moreover, it is shown that this scheme can resist all serious attacks including the intercept-resend attack, measurement-resend attack, auxiliary particle attack and even the Denial of Service attack. To improve the efficiency of the proposed scheme, the hidden rule is extended based on the tensor product of multiple Bell states. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84888122634	Design and implementation of a novel general format multimedia digital rights management system	Aiming at the copyright protection of multimedia content, a novel general format multimedia digital rights management model was designed which includes encryption and packaging of content, key management, security engine, license management and distribution, DRM client, DRM management and other functional units. This model uses unstructured encryption method which overcomes the limitations of encryption method based on the content format to support the general format multimedia. In addition, this model uses the license acquisition number as the only certificate to download license to solve the problem of license reissue and transfer, and supports fine-grained control model. Combined with this model, a multimedia digital rights management system was developed based on fixed and mobile converged services which is used in the field of digital consumer. The experimental results and practical application show that this scheme with good practice in the copyright protection of multimedia content does not affect the multimedia quality, and have high efficiency and safety.

84891913276	A digital watermarking method based on particle swarm optimization and contourlet transform	As a key technology for digital content copyright protection, digital watermark often sees a dilemma between imperceptibility and robustness. In view of the problem, this paper suggests a CT-SVD-based intelligent watermarking scheme that embraces three major algorithms including the watermark preprocessing, the watermark embedding, and extracting. The host image is first decomposed by contourlet transform to get the low frequency subband images on which the SVD decomposition is then implemented before embedding the preprocessed watermark. The watermark extracting is an inversion of watermark embedding. To maximize the watermark robustness while maintaining its imperceptibility, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to have heuristic searches for scaling factor. The experiment has demonstrated that this scheme is capable of resisting frequent image attacks with better imperceptibility and robustness. © Springer-Verlag 2013.

In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving digital rights management (DRM) scheme using homomorphic encryption in cloud computing. We present an efficient digital rights management framework in cloud computing, which allows content provider to outsource encrypted contents to centralized content server and allows user to consume contents with the license issued by license server. Further, we provide a secure content key distribution scheme based on additive homomorphic probabilistic public key encryption and proxy re-encryption.

84891821009	A novel quantum steganography protocol based on probability measurements	Quantum steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communications, which transmit the secret message in an insecure quantum channel, are occurring. This paper presents a novel quantum steganography protocol based on probability measurements for transmitting n qubits secret message in an insecure quantum channel. In the protocol, senders embed the secret message into the cover data by POVM measurements. Then, receivers can correctly extract the secret message and recover the cover data with a certain probability by selecting two sets of appropriate protective measurement operators to act projective measurements, respectively. More importantly, the existence of the secret message has no influence on the cover data. In addition, the security of our protocol does not rely on other protocols. The paper analyzes the secrecy and the security in detail. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84894600316	Authorization protocol of multimedia digital rights management based on proxy re-encryption	In order to protect the copyright of digital content, an authorization protocol of multimedia digital rights management based on proxy re-encryption is proposed. The proposed protocol allows content providers to encrypt multimedia content on their clients, and allows the users to share the encrypted multimedia content and apply license from license server. After obtaining the license, the users can apply the content encryption key from key proxy server. The key proxy server re-encrypts the content encryption key and sends the encrypted content encryption key to the users, while license server cannot get the content encryption key. Based on the proposed protocol, a content sharing platform for digital TV programs in cloud computing is developed. The comparison results and practical application show that the proposed protocol does not need to re-encrypt content when sharing, and can effectively resist the collision attacks, which is efficient and secure.

Instead of using the entanglement, we only utilize the single photon to efficiently realize the comparison of secret information. Furthermore, a more feasible QPCE protocol, which can be successfully performed via the collective amplitude damping channel, is put forward. In our QPCE protocols, a semi-honest third party (TP) is involved. It is an appealing advantage in the practical implementation of protocol.

84896525927	Privacy-preserving digital rights management scheme in cloud computing	In order to meet the needs of digital content and user privacy protection in cloud computing environment, a privacy-preserving digital rights management (DRM) scheme in cloud computing was proposed. The framework of digital content copyright lifecycle protection and user privacy protection in cloud computing was firstly designed, which includes four protocols: system setup, content encryption, license acquisition and content decryption, and then a content encryption key protection and distribution mechanism based on attribute-based encryption and additively homomorphic encryption was proposed, which ensures the security of content encryption key. In addition, the proposed scheme also allows the users to purchase content and acquire license anonymously from cloud service provider, which protects the user privacy and prevents cloud service provider, license server and key server in the cloud from collecting the user's sensitive information. Compared with existing DRM schemes in cloud computing, the proposed scheme which not only protects the data security and user privacy, but also supports fine-grained access control, and supports online and super-distribution application modes, is more applicable in the copyright protection for cloud computing.

84896118704	Encrypted data sharing with multi-owner based on digital rights management in online social networks	The online social networks (OSNs) offer attractive means for social interactions and data sharing, as well as raise a number of security and privacy issues. Although current solutions propose to encrypt data before sharing, the access control of encrypted data has become a challenging task. Moreover, multiple owners may enforce different access policy to the same data because of their different privacy concerns. A digital rights management (DRM) scheme is proposed for encrypted data in OSNs. In order to protect users' sensitive data, the scheme allows users outsource encrypted data to the OSNs service provider for sharing and customize the access policy of their data based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. Furthermore, the scheme presents a multiparty access control model based on identity-based broadcast encryption and ciphertext-policy attribute-based proxy re-encryption, which enables multiple owners, such as tagged users who appear in a single data, customize the access policy collaboratively, and also allows the disseminators update the access policy if their attributes satisfy the existing access policy. Security analysis and comparison indicate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient. © 2014 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

84902177857	Improving security and efciency for encrypted data sharing in online social networks	Despite that existing data sharing systems in online social networks (OSNs) propose to encrypt data before sharing, the multiparty access control of encrypted data has become a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a secure data sharing scheme in OSNs based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based proxy re-encryption and secret sharing. In order to protect users' sensitive data, our scheme allows users to customize access policies of their data and then outsource encrypted data to the OSNs service provider. Our scheme presents a multiparty access control model, which enables the disseminator to update the access policy of ciphertext if their attributes satisfy the existing access policy. Further, we present a partial decryption construction in which the computation overhead of user is largely reduced by delegating most of the decryption operations to the OSNs service provider. We also provide checkability on the results returned from the OSNs service provider to guarantee the correctness of partial decrypted ciphertext. Moreover, our scheme presents an efficient attribute revocation method that achieves both forward and backward secrecy. The security and performance analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme is secure and effcient in OSNs. © 2013 IEEE.

84903730391	Attribute based DRM scheme with dynamic usage control in cloud computing	In order to achieve fine-grained access control in cloud computing, existing digital rights management (DRM) schemes adopt attribute-based encryption as the main encryption primitive. However, these schemes suffer from inefficiency and cannot support dynamic updating of usage rights stored in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel DRM scheme with secure key management and dynamic usage control in cloud computing. We present a secure key management mechanism based on attribute-based encryption and proxy re-encryption. Only the users whose attributes satisfy the access policy of the encrypted content and who have effective usage rights can be able to recover the content encryption key and further decrypt the content. The attribute based mechanism allows the content provider to selectively provide fine-grained access control of contents among a set of users, and also enables the license server to implement immediate attribute and user revocation. Moreover, our scheme supports privacy-preserving dynamic usage control based on additive homomorphic encryption, which allows the license server in the cloud to update the users' usage rights dynamically without disclosing the plaintext. Extensive analytical results indicate that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient. © 2013 IEEE.

84904733362	JPEG2000 image maximum steganography payload based on MPUI model	Steganography payload is one of the four key performance indicators for information hiding. Previous research on information hiding has mainly focused on the other three performance indicators, namely, the robustness, transparency and computational complexity, with very few work being carried out regarding to the steganography payload. This research aims to effectively improve the theoretical system of information hiding. According to the JPEG2000 compression standard and the human eye sensitivity of changing wavelet coefficients, along with the aid of distortion cost function, the study discriminates the wavelet coefficients' carrying capacity of secret information: The smaller the distortion cost function value, the stronger the wavelet coefficients' carrying capacity. Conversely, the larger distortion cost function value, the weaker the wavelet coefficients' carrying capacity. When the distortion cost function value is greater than one, the coefficient will not have enough capacity to carry information, i.e., wet coefficients. By means of the maximum steganography payload experiments along with the bit full embedding, over bits embedding and wet embedding experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method in this work is verified. © 2014 ISCAS.

84904742254	Non-uniform quantization in breaking HUGO	In breaking HUGO (Highly Undetectable Stegonagraphy), an advanced steganographic scheme recently developed for uncompressed images, the research on steganalysis has made rapid progress recently. That is, more advanced statistical models often utilizing high dimensional features have been adopted. It is noted that there is one thing in common for all of these newly developed advanced steganalytic schemes. That is, uniform quantization has been applied to residual images in order to reduce the feature dimensionality. In this paper, non-uniform quantization is proposed, developed and utilized to break the HUGO. In constructing non-uniform quantizers, a small portion of available samples from both cover and stego images are utilized to provide needed statistics. Utilizing non-uniform quantization we can achieve better steganalytic performance than using uniform quantization under, otherwise, the same framework. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84904983912	Secure data sharing and retrieval using attribute-based encryption in cloud-based OSNs	The Online social networks (OSNs) offer attractive means for social interactions and data sharing, but also raise a number of security and privacy issues. Since the OSNs service provider is always semi-trusted, current solutions propose to encrypt data before sharing. However, data encryption causes a lot of inconveniences and large overheads for data dissemination and data retrieval. In this paper, we propose a secure data sharing and retrieval scheme in cloud-based OSNs. Based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, our scheme achieves multiparty access control, which allows data owners to outsource encrypted data to the OSNs service provider for sharing, and enables data disseminators to disseminate the data owners' data by customizing new access policy. Our scheme also provides searchable encryption scheme to support fast searches in massive amount of encrypted data from both data owners and data disseminators. Further, our scheme preserves the privacy of data owners and data retrievers during the data sharing and retrieval processes. In addition, the computation overhead of data retrievers is reduced by delegating most of the decryption operations to the OSNs service provider. The security and performance analysis results indicate that our scheme is secure and privacy-preserving.
