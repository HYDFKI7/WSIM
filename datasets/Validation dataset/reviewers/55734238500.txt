40349086079	Synthesis of carbon nanofibers by ethanol catalytic combustion technique	A general, simple and economic synthetic method for synthesizing carbon nanofibers was presented. In the method, ethanol was employed as carbon source; metal salts such as nickel nitrate, ferric nitrate and ferric chloride were used as catalyst precursor respectively; copper plate was employed as the support material. A lot of products were obtained by catalytic combustion deposition of ethanol vapor. Then the as-prepared carbon nanofibers were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy and selected-area electron diffractometry. By analyzing the results of characterization, the conclusions are as follows: 1) the large catalyst particles tend to form large-diameter CNFs, small catalyst particles are inclinable to form small-diameter CNFs; 2) the morphology of the catalyst can affect the final morphology of the CNFs. Moreover, the possible growth mechanisms were proposed and the degree of graphitization of samples was estimated by Raman spectroscopy characterization. © 2008 Published by: Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer.

84877283238	Linear-grating triboelectric generator based on sliding electrification	The triboelectric effect is known for many centuries and it is the cause of many charging phenomena. However, it has not been utilized for energy harvesting until very recently.(1-5) Here we developed a new principle of triboelectric generator (TEG) based on a fully contacted, sliding electrification process, which lays a fundamentally new mechanism for designing universal, high-performance TEGs to harvest diverse forms of mechanical energy in our daily life. Relative displacement between two sliding surfaces of opposite triboelectric polarities generates uncompensated surface triboelectric charges; the corresponding polarization created a voltage drop that results in a flow of induced electrons between electrodes. Grating of linear rows on the sliding surfaces enables substantial enhancements of total charges, output current, and current frequency. The TEG was demonstrated to be an efficient power source for simultaneously driving a number of small electronics. The principle established in this work can be applied to TEGs of different configurations that accommodate the needs of harvesting energy and/or sensing from diverse mechanical motions, such as contacted sliding, lateral translation, and rotation/rolling. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

We have fabricated three types of regular and uniform polymer patterned arrays (line, cube and pyramid) to improve the efficiency of the nanogenerator and make it transparent. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 18 V at a power density of ~0.13 μA/cm2. Furthermore, the as-prepared nanogenerator can be applied as a self-powered pressure sensor for sensing a water droplet (8 mg, ~3.6 Pa in contact pressure) and a falling feather (20 mg, ~0.4 Pa in contact pressure).TEGs have the potential of harvesting energy from human activities, rotating tires, ocean waves, mechanical vibration and more, with great applications in self-powered systems for personal electronics, environmental monitoring, medical science and even large-scale power. © OSA 2013.

Using this effect, we experimentally demonstrate the first application of pyroelectric ZnO nanowire arrays for converting heat energy into electricity. The coupling of the pyroelectric and semiconducting properties in ZnO creates a polarization electric field and charge separation along the ZnO nanowire as a result of the time-dependent change in temperature.

The device is a metal-semiconductor- metal structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)-GaN-ITO. Under different straining conditions, the changing trend of the transport properties of GaN films can be divided into two types, corresponding to the different c-axis orientations of the films. An extreme value was observed for the integral EL intensity under certain applied strain due to the adjusted minority carrier injection efficiency by piezoelectric charges introduced at the M-S interface. The external quantum efficiency of the blue EL at 430 nm was changed by 5.84% under different straining conditions, which is 1 order of magnitude larger than the change of the green peak at 540 nm. The results indicate that the piezo-phototronic effect has a larger impact on the shallow acceptor states related EL process than on the one related to the deep acceptor states in p-type GaN films. This study has great significance on the practical applications of GaN in optoelectronic devices under a working environment where mechanical deformation is unavoidable such as for flexible/printable light emitting diodes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

In our experiments, the catalyst precursors were iron nitrate, cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, and iron chloride, cobalt chloride, nickel chloride. The as-synthesized products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the optimal position of substrates in flames is more than 1cm and less than 2.5cm, the optimal preparation time is more than 5min and less than 30min for massive yield, stable flames would be tent to synthesize CNFs with mainly single-type morphology and could improve the graphitization of CNFs, and the catalyst precursors obviously have effects on the synthesis of CNFs.

84874415453	Piezotronic effect on the sensitivity and signal level of schottky contacted proactive micro/nanowire nanosensors	We demonstrated the first piezoelectric effect on the performance of a pH sensor using an MSM back-to-back Schottky contacted ZnO micro/nanowire device. When the device is subjected to an external strain, a piezopotential is created in the micro/nanowire, which tunes the effective heights of the Schottky barriers at the local contacts, consequently increasing the sensitivity and signal level of the sensors. Furthermore, the strain-produced piezopotential along the ZnO micro/nanowire will lead to a nonuniform distribution of the target molecules near the micro/nanowire surface owing to electrostatic interaction, which will make the sensor proactive to detect the target molecules even at extremely low overall concentration, which naturally improves the sensitivity and lowers the detection limit. A theoretical model is proposed to explain the observed performance of the sensor using the energy band diagram. This prototype device offers a new concept for designing supersensitive and fast-response micro/nanowire sensors by introducing an external strain and piezotronic effect, which may have great applications in building sensors with fast response and reset time, high selectivity, high sensitivity, and good signal-to-noise ratio for chemical, biochemical, and gas sensing. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Here, we demonstrate that a nanowire light-emitting diode-based pressure sensor array can map two-dimensional distributions of strain with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 2.7 μm, corresponding to a pixel density of 6,350 dpi. Each pixel is composed of a single n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN light-emitting diode, the emission intensity of which depends on the local strain owing to the piezo-phototronic effect. A pressure map can be created by reading out, in parallel, the electroluminescent signal from all of the pixels with a time resolution of 90 ms.

84896361710	Manipulating nanoscale contact electrification by an applied electric field	Contact electrification is about the charge transfer between the surfaces of two materials in a contact-separation process. This effect has been widely utilized in particle separation and energy harvesting, where the charge transfer is preferred to be maximized. However, this effect is always undesirable in some areas such as electronic circuit systems due to the damage from the accumulated electrostatic charges. Herein, we introduced an approach to purposely manipulate the contact electrification process both in polarity and magnitude of the charge transfer through an applied electric field between two materials. Theoretical modeling and the corresponding experiments for controlling the charge transfer between a Pt coated atomic force microscopy tip and Parylene film have been demonstrated. The modulation effect of the electric field on contact electrification is enhanced for a thinner dielectric layer. This work can potentially be utilized to enhance the output performance of energy harvesting devices or nullify contact electric charge transfer in applications where this effect is undesirable. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84903488394	Harvesting water wave energy by asymmetric screening of electrostatic charges on a nanostructured hydrophobic thin-film surface	Energy harvesting from ambient water motions is a desirable but underexplored solution to on-site energy demand for self-powered electronics. Here we report a liquid-solid electrification-enabled generator based on a fluorinated ethylene propylene thin film, below which an array of electrodes are fabricated. The surface of the thin film is charged first due to the water-solid contact electrification. Aligned nanowires created on the thin film make it hydrophobic and also increase the surface area. Then the asymmetric screening to the surface charges by the waving water during emerging and submerging processes causes the free electrons on the electrodes to flow through an external load, resulting in power generation. The generator produces sufficient output power for driving an array of small electronics during direct interaction with water bodies, including surface waves and falling drops. Polymer-nanowire-based surface modification increases the contact area at the liquid-solid interface, leading to enhanced surface charging density and thus electric output at an efficiency of 7.7%. Our planar-structured generator features an all-in-one design without separate and movable components for capturing and transmitting mechanical energy. It has extremely lightweight and small volume, making it a portable, flexible, and convenient power solution that can be applied on the ocean/river surface, at coastal/offshore areas, and even in rainy places. Considering the demonstrated scalability, it can also be possibly used in large-scale energy generation if layers of planar sheets are connected into a network. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

It is comprised of two parts: an interfacial electrification enabled TENG (IE-TENG) and an impact-TENG. The IE-TENG, composed of a fluorinated ethylene propylene thin film and an array of electrodes underneath, is used to harvest electrostatic energy arising from the water-solid interface.

Under water waves propagating at a speed of 0.5. m/s, the short-circuit current of the IE-TENG and impact-TENG can reach 5.1. μA and 4.3. μA, respectively, which is able to drive nearly 50 LEDs simultaneously. Considering that natural water bodies may contain minerals and salt, the influence of NaCl concentration on the electric output of device has been investigated. Moreover, the hybrid TENG was developed as a self-powered distress signals emitter that may be used for life saving in water landing or swimming in evening. Considering the scalability of this technology, this work demonstrates the great potential of TENG in areas of hydropower harvesting, environmental monitoring and maritime search and rescue. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
