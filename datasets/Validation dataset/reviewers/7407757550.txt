9644268006	Size-dependent exciton chirality in (R)-(+)-1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol dimethyl ether nanoparticles	Organic nanoparticles from a chiral auxiliary, (R)-(+)-1,1′-bl-2- naphthol dimethyl ether (BNDE), with a range of particle sizes from 25 to 100 nm were fabricated through the reprecipitation method. It is found that BNDE nanoparticles exhibit positive exciton chirality in 200-260 nm region in circular dichroism (CD) spectra, which are completely opposite to CD spectra of the dilute solution. The exciton chirality of the particles displays size-dependent behavior; that is, the exciton chirality peaks evolve to the low-energy side with increase in particles size. CD spectra accompanied with UV, fluorescence spectra, lifetime measurements of the excited states, and quantum mechanical calculations reveal that the chirality inversion results from intermolecular exciton coupling between two adjacent BNDE molecules in the nanoparticles, and the bathochromic shift of the peaks is attributed to the increased intermolecular interaction with increasing particle size.

18244426239	Studies on photovoltaic characteristics of hemin and its organized assembly by surface photovoltage spectroscopy	The photovoltaic behaviors of hemin and its organized assembly prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique were studied by surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) and electric field induced surface photovoltage spectroscopy (FEISPS). The SPS of the hemin powder exhibited a strong response originated from the Soret band and a weak response from the Q band. After hemin and the mixture of hemin and n-octadecylamine (ODA) were deposited onto ITO glasses as the thin films by LB technique, the photovoltaic responses became very weak in the whole UV-vis region when no external bias was applied. As the positive external electric field was applied, both pure hemin and the mixture of hemin and ODA LB films showed a strong photovoltaic response at 340 nm. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0030677487	Structural study on the alternating langmuir-blodgett films deposited with two complementary barbituric acid and melamine derivatives	Alternating Langmuir-Blodgett films were deposited with two complementary molecules: 5-(4-N,N-dioctadecyl aminobenzylidene)-2,4,6-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinetrione (B) and 4-amino-2,6-didodecylamino-1, 3,5-triazine (M). Pressure-area isotherms were recorded. The transfer behavior of the alternating films was compared with that of the separate films of B. X-ray diffraction measurements confirm that the alternating films have a genuinely alternating structure: MBMB...MB. Transmission FTIR measurements reveal that in the separate films B is exclusively self-aggregated through the hydrogen bonding between the C=O and N-H on the barbituric ring of B, and in the alternating films new hydrogen bonds are formed between B and M at the expense of those of the initial self-aggregation. Polarized attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements show that in the alternating films the hydrocarbon chains stand almost vertically, in comparison with the separate films of B as well as of M. It is found that in the alternating films the 2-position carbonyl on the barbituric ring of B is perpendicular to the film plane. It is concluded that the interlayer hydrogen bonding between B and M gives rise to a better film structure.

0032180005	Spectral study on the formation of a self-assembled mesoscopic supercoil	Molecular recognition directing self-assembly of two complementary molecular components, 5-(4-dodecyloxybenzylidene)-2,4,6-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinetrione (B) and 4-amino-2,6-didodecylamino-1,3,5-triazine (M), was found to form a mesoscopic supercoil structure with length of several tens of μm and diameter of ca. 300 nm. Fluorescence spectral studies show that it takes more than 1200 h for the self-assembling process to reach the equilibrium in chloroform. It was suggested that in this system with positive cooperation, at least two steps were involved in the self-assembling process. First, supramolecular tapes, cyclic hexamers, are formed based on the network of triple complementary hydrogen bonds between B and M. Second, π-aromatic stacking and van der Waals interactions drive further the assembling of tapes into more complex nanometric strand. The coiling of the strands results in the formation of the supercoil structure.

Three complementary strand systems were adopted to direct the assembly of the 13 nm Au nanoparticles including PS oligo-A and PS oligo-B were designed to be complementary to DNA linker C in a head-to-head manner. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were carried out to elucidate the orientation of PS oligo-A loaded onto the particle surface.

All the NPs were prepared through the reprecipitation method in which mixtures of TPP and DCM in ethanol were used. The aqueous dispersions of DCM-doped TPP NPs are found to show different emission colors depending on the solutions used in preparation. The tunable emission of the NPs is illustrated by the evolution of the fluorescence spectra of their aqueous dispersions with changing DCM content. The results show that the tunable emission is attributed to the change in the degree of aggregation of DCM molecules in the NPs.

It is identified that the intra-supramolecular charge transfer between the inorganic and organic molecules is responsible for the visible-light coloration. Interestingly, the films show photo-memory and thermal activation. The films show a small change in absorbance after being irradiated with visible light for a short time, and the coloration can be enhanced greatly by subsequent thermal treatment. Electrical measurements indicate that the conductivity of the film increases after the brief irradiation, which promotes transfer of the electrons induced by the thermal treatment. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It was found that after UV irradiation the composite films with different molar ratios of organic/inorganic components exhibited different colors. The UV-irradiated films showed dark blue, dark khaki and light sea green colors when the ratios were 1.0, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. It was identified by Raman spectra that the polymolybdate species formed in the composite films after UV irradiation were sensitive to the ratios of the organic/inorganic components, thus resulting in the different colors of irradiated films. Citric acid played an important role during the photochromic process. Under UV light irradiation, it served as hole scavenger that suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes to make the polymolybdates show UV light photochromism. © 2005 SIOC, CAS, & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

27544472407	Synthesis of ordered biosilica materials	Biogenic silica with amazing diversity of nanostructure shells, fibers and granules in diatoms and sponges is mediated by proteins and polysaccharides and forms at ambient pressure and temperatures.

One kind of benign synthesis method through plant cell wall template-directed ordered biosilica materials under ambient conditions is intriguing in this context.

The intermolecular interactions between solvents and DTTC, and the cohesion parameters were used for evaluating the influences of bad solvents on the particles formation.

The enhanced and size-tunable off-resonant third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) responses of these nanoparticles were confirmed. The NLO enhancement of the nanoparticles compared to that of the monomer was demonstrated to originate from the increased Intra-CT process due to the improved planarity of the ligands in the particles. The size-dependent NLO responses of the nanoparticles were attributed to the gradual predominance of the Inter-CT at the expense of the Intra-CT with increasing the particle size. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The morphologies and properties of the as-obtained DPI hierarchical mesostructures can be readily controlled by changing the assembly conditions such as the sort of solvent, the DPI concentration and the ripening time. The measurements of ESI-MS, FT-IR and Auger electron spectroscopes indicate that the complex formed by the coordination between DPI and copper plays an important role in that it provides a center for the nucleation and growth of the 2D sheet-like basic units. The DPI mesostructures can change the property of copper surface and endow the copper with novel surface performances. Moreover, it should be feasible to extend the strategy described here to other metal-ligand systems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The covalent attachment processes were followed and confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which demonstrated that the ASNPs/GOx multilayer films are formed in a progressive and uniform manner. The gold electrodes modified with the ASNPs/GOx multilayer films were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and showed excellent electrocatalytical response to the oxidation of glucose when ferrocenemethanol was used as an artificial redox mediator. From the analysis of voltammetric signals, the coverage of active enzyme on the electrode was estimated, which showed a linear relationship with the number of ASNPs/GOx bilayers. This suggests that the analytical performance such as sensitivity, detection limit is tunable by controlling the number of attached bilayers. The linear response range of the biosensor constructed with four bilayers of ASNPs/GOx to the concentration of glucose can extend at least to 8 mm and reached 95% of the steady-state current in less than 4 s with the sensitivity of 5.11 μA/mm cm

The introduction of the absorbents can significantly improve the dimensional uniformity of the as-prepared TPI nanowires. The TPI nanowires displayed interesting size-dependent optical properties, that is, the absorption spectra of the wires exhibit an obvious blue shift with the decrease of diameter, and simultaneously, the vibrational fine structures of the emission spectra emerge and become more pronounced with the diameter decreasing from 500 to 40 nm even at room temperature, which are usually observed only under cryogenic conditions. The emergence and enhancement of the vibrational structures are contributed to the increase of the long-range order and the degree of orientation with the decrease of diameter.

The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the nanoparticles experience a bathochromic shift with an increase in the particle size and the intensity ratio of the first to the third cotton effect (CE) increases as the nanoparticle size increases to 60 nm. And also the nanoparticles show excimer emission that enhances as the particle size grows. CD spectra accompanied with UV, fluorescence emission spectra, reveal that the size-tunable optical properties are attributed to the synergetic effect of the change of dihedral angle in the initial stage and the more effective formation of excimer between the two naphthalene chromophores in adjacent molecules as nanoparticles grow. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

34547453251	Conformational change induced reversible assembly/disassembly of poly-L-lysine-functionalized gold nanoparticles	The poly-L-lysine-functionalized gold nanoparticle (PLL-GNP) was found to undergo reversible assembly/ disassembly in the range of pH from 6.5 to 11.0 at room temperature. At a high pH value, the deprotonated lysine residues allow the formation of α-helix and β-sheet structures at the expense of a part of random coil and β-turn structures, thus inducing the assembly of GNPs. With a decrease of pH to 6.5, the assembly of GNPs is disrupted due to the conversion of the α-helix and β-sheet back into the random and β-turn. It is identified that the formation/collapse of an antiparallel β-sheet structure among PLL chains from adjacent GNPs is responsible for reversible pH-dependent assembly/disassembly of GNPs. Since the conformationinduced assembly/disassembly process of the PLL-GNP can be well recognized by a shift of the surface plasmon resonance band of the GNP and the color change of the solution, this study presents the possibility of following the conformation change of a peptide by monitoring the spectral change of the GNP. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

Further assembly of such chiral supermolecules results in the formation of the observed mesoscopic supercoil structure. Owing to the lack of chirality in 1 and 2, both left- and right-handed supercoils are observed.

In this study, the size-dependent nature of the molar extinction coefficient of "greener" CuInS<inf>2</inf> and ZnCuInS<inf>3</inf> NCs with emission covering the whole visible to near infrared (NIR) is presented. With the increase of NC size, the resulting quantitative values of the extinction coefficients of ternary CuInS<inf>2</inf> and quaternary ZnCuInS<inf>3</inf> NCs are found to follow a power function with exponents of 2.1 and 2.5, respectively. Obviously, a larger value of extinction coefficient is observed in quaternary NCs for the same size of particles. The difference of the extinction coefficient from both samples is clearly demonstrated due to incorporating ZnS with a much larger extinction coefficient into CuInS<inf>2</inf> NCs. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The resulting superparamagnetic silica spheres with a saturation magnetization value of 30 emu/g could be enriched completely within 10 s under the application of a 0.4 T magnet. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging indicated a core-shell structure of the spheres. Adsorption and elution experiments of salmon sperm DNA showed an excellent ability of the superparamagnetic mesoporous silica spheres to adsorb DNA. Electrophoresis experiments show that the superparamagnetic mesoporous silica spheres are qualified for efficient recovery of DNA fragments from agarose gel. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009.

64949164207	Characterization and non cellular ROS activities of nano silica particles	Objective: To detect the characterization and non cellular ROS activities of nano silica particle and provide references for predicting its toxicity in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe particle size, shape and dispersibility of the two silica particles; the size and agglomeration state of particles in water, saline, 10% Tween 80, RPMI 1640 and RPMI 1640 containing 1% FBS were measured in 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after 30 s-sonication by Zeta Potential Analyzer; non cellular ROS activity was detected using DCFH-DA regents. Results: TEM image showed nano silica particles were round and dispersed evenly; the average sizes of the two silica particles were (43.0 ± 4.2) and (68.0 ± 5. 7) nm. Silica particles had different sizes in water, saline, 10% Tween 80, RPMI 1640 and RPMI1 640 containing 1% FBS, among them, two particles had smallest sizes in saline, which were 74.0 and 96.7 nm, respectively. And at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after 30 s-sonication, Si-43 nm and Si-68 nm did not form agglomeration in water but formed similar agglomeration in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium containing 1% FBS.

66349115032	Conversion between two-dimensional square and hexagonal close-packed architectures in aggregates of au nanoparticles mediated by bending DNA linkers	DNA linkers with different bending angles were employed to mediate the conversion between the 2D hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and square architectures in the aggregates of 13 nm Au nanoparticles directed by oligo-DNA. For terminus thiol-modified (TM) oligo-DNA oriented almost perpendicularly on the particle surface, the architecture is converted from hcp to square with increased bending angle of the Tinker molecules as a result of increased steric effect. For phosphate backbone sulfur modified (PM) oligo-DNA loaded approximately parallel on the particle surface, the architecture is converted from square to hcp with increased bending angle of the linkers as a result of the decreased steric effect.

77956482245	Synthesis, spectroscopy, crystal structure determination, and quantum chemical calculations of BODIPY dyes with increasing conformational restriction and concomitant red-shifted visible absorption and fluorescence spectra	Starting from the conforma-tionally unconstrained compound 3, 5-di-(2-bromophenoxy)-4, 4-difluoro-8-(4-methylphenyl)-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-in-dacene (1), two BODIPY dyes (2 and 3) with increasingly rigid conformations were synthesized in outstanding total yields through palladium catalyzed intramolecular benzofuran formation. Restricted bond rotation of the phenoxy fragments leads to dyes 2 and 3, which absorb and fluoresce more intensely at longer wavelengths relative to the unconstrained dye 1. Reduction of the conformational flexibility in 2 and 3 leads to significantly higher fluorescence quantum yields compared to those of 1. X-ray diffraction analysis shows the progressively more extended planarity of the chromophore in line with the increasing conformational restriction in the series 1→2→3, which explains the larger red shifts of the absorption and emission spectra. These conclusions are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations of the lowest electronic excitations in 1-3 and dyes of related chemical structures. The effect of the molecular structure on the visible absorption and fluorescence emission properties of 1-3 has been examined as a function of solvent by means of the new, generalized treatment of the solvent effect (J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 5951-5960). Solvent polarizability is the primary factor responsible for the small solvent-dependent shifts of the visible absorption and fluorescence emission bands of these dyes. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

78649444697	Size control over spherical silver nanoparticles by ascorbic acid reduction	Quasi-spherical silver nanoparticles were synthesized by using ascorbic acid as reductant and citrate as stabilizer in a 30 °C water bath. Average size of the silver nanoparticles decreased from 73. nm to 31. nm as pH of the reaction system increased from 6.0 to 10.5. Quantitative analyses indicated that reduction of the silver precursor was promoted at elevated pH attributed to increased activity of ascorbic acid. As a result, number of the nucleus and thus the size of the silver nanoparticles were tunable by simply changing pH of the reaction system. Moreover, the shape of the nanoparticles became more spherical-like after being heated at 100 °C for 2. h to facilitate the intraparticle ripening. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78651389320	Incorporating anionic dyes into silica nanoparticles by using a cationic polyelectrolyte as a bridge	A negatively charged dye, 8-hydroxypyene-1,3,6-sulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS), was successfully incorporated into a silica matrix by using a positively charged polyelectrolyte, poly (diallyldimethylammoniumchloride) (PDADMAC) as a bridge. The positive charges of PDADMAC were partially neutralized by HPTS upon the formation of PDADMAC-HPTS complexes. After being introduced into a Stöber system and pre-hydrolyzed for a finite time, the surface charge of the complexes was rapidly reversed from positive to negative due to the absorption of the negatively charged silica species on their surface, which was important to avoid flocculation of the complexes and allow the growth of the silica particles. Stability of the complexes and thus the size of resulting particles were tunable by changing either the positive charges of the complexes or the pre-hydrolyzation time of the Stöber system. The optical performance of the silica particles was improved and the leakage of the dye from the particles was greatly suppressed due to the electrostatic interaction between the dye and polyelectrolyte. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

78651099543	Photo-generated charges characteristics of CdS/ZnO heterostructures materials	The photo-generated charges characteristics of CdS/ZnO heterostructures materials were studied by means of surface photovoltage techniques. The results show that the photovoltage intensities of CdS/ZnO heterostructures materials decrease comparing with that of CdS. From the results of transient photovoltage measurement, the photo-generated electrons of CdS can transfer to ZnO since an electric field formed on the interface between CdS and ZnO. But this field is too weak to dominate the photo-generated charges characteristics. This result indicates that photo-generated charges characteristics can be clarified furthermore by means of surface photovoltage phase and transient photovoltage techniques.

The results show that all the dislocations of n-AlGaN/GaN heterostructures films are negatively charged, and the maxinum contact potential difference between the dislocations and GaN is about 590 mV. Moreover the contact potential variations around the dislocations in n-AlGaN/GaN heterostructures films is much larger than that of dislocations in diameter. The photo-generated charges rediscontribution was observed under illumination. This result indicates that surface charges of semiconductor in nano-scale can be measured quantitatively by KFM in vacuum condition.

0035882156	Effect of electric field and doping on photovoltaic properties of α-bromine-terthiophene thin film	The photovoltaic properties of α-bromine-terthiophene thin film were investigated by means of surface photovoltage spectroscopy and field-induced surface photovoltage spectroscopy. The surface photovoltaic (SPV) response intensity of the π→π* transition band (300-430 nm) was enhanced when a positive electric field was applied and it was weakened when a negative electric field was applied. Interestingly, three new photovoltaic response bands were observed in the visible and near-IR region (430-1200 nm) under an external electric field. After the film was doped with iodine vapor, the three photovoltaic response bands can be observed without an external electric field being applied. According to the principle of FISPS and phase technique, the three bands can be explained by the charge-resonance of the dimer radical cations in the doped film. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It was shown that volume content of 1-propanol has great effect on structure and hydrothermal stability of the resulting silica. As the volume content of 1-propanol was in the range of 40-90. vol%, the resulting silica were spherical in shape and their diameter decreased from 2 μm to 500. nm with increased volume content of 1-propanol attributed to the co-solvent effect of 1-propanol. In the range of the volume content from 40. vol% to 60. vol%, 1-propanol also acted as co-surfactant which made the pore size of the silica spheres increase from 2.70. nm to 3.83. nm with increasing the volume content from 40. vol% to 60. vol%. When the volume content was below 40. vol%, 1-propanol only acted as co-surfactant and silica irregular in shape was obtained. MSU-4 silica spheres prepared under the volume content of 40-60. vol% showed higher condensation degree and thus improved hydrothermal stability when 1-proponal acted as both co-surfactant and co-solvent. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The various sizes and composition of Cu-Zn-In-S NCs were well controlled by simply changing reaction temperature and the ratio of the precursors, respectively. Accordingly, as produced these particles exhibited tunable photoluminescence (PL) spectra with emission color tuned from visible to the NIR region and had a relatively high QY of over 70% without coating any wide band gap shell materials. Further experimental results revealed that Cu-Zn-In-S NCs showed some advantages in contrast to typical plain II-VI and III-V semiconductor NCs.

The nonlinear properties of the gold nanoparticles have been investigated by using the Open-aperture Z-scan technique with the nanosecond pulse at a wavelength of 532 nm. It shows out that all the gold nanoparticles possess strong optical nonlinearities when being excited at their surface plasmon resonances. It is identified that the nonlinear properties of the gold nanoparticles are dependent on their shapes, and the icosahedra gold nanoparticles show much better nonlinear optical properties than the tetrahedral and cubic ones. Moreover, the mechanism for the process of the nonlinear properties is also analyzed. Crown Copyright © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84864430569	Tuning the size of gold nanoparticles in the citrate reduction by chloride ions	A new approach was developed to control the size of gold nanoparticles in citrate reduction by altering the concentration of chloride ions. The size of the as-prepared gold nanoparticles could be tuned in the range 19-47 nm at a specific molar ratio of citrate and tetrachloroauric acid (5:1) by simply changing the concentration of chloride ions from 0 to 20 mM. UV-visible spectra and TEM observations showed that the increased size of the gold particles was primarily related to the promoted aggregation of the primary gold particles. The aggregation was attributed to their decreased surface charge as the chloride ion concentration in the reaction solutions increased. This approach could also be extended to other reaction systems, for example, the size of gold nanoparticles prepared by NaBH

0036814773	Chemical microenvironment mediated formation of organic nanostructures from self-assembly of melamine and barbituric acid derivatives	The recent progresses on constructing organic nanostructures from the self-assembly of melamine and barbituric acid derivatives are reviewed. By mediating the chemical microenvironment during the self-assembly, the information contained in the molecular components can be expressed at different levels, thus resulting in the formation of different organic nanostructures. When the assembly is carried out in anhydrous chloroform, a kind of asymmetric layered structure with a d value of 4.1 nm is obtained. When a little amount of polar solvent such as alcohol is contained in the chloroform, organic nanotubes with diameter of 6 nm and length of several hundreds of nanometers are observed. After being treated by appropriate polar solvents, the nanotubes are induced into supercoils with diameter of about 300 nm and length of several tens of microns. The sensitivity of the self-assembly process origins from the weak noncovalent intermolecular interactions between the molecular components. The enthalpy change of such interactions is pretty small, so slight change of the molecular structure of microenvironment could affect the primary equilibrium, resulting in the rearrangement and transformation of the supramolecular structure.

It is found that L-lysine molecules are absorbed onto the Au colloid surface via the interactions between the ε-amino group of L-lysine and the Au colloid. UV-visible spectral measurements show there are strong interactions between the Au nanoparticles linked by dipeptides (lysine-lysine) in the self-assembly.

The average diameters of the particles were controlled by variation of the aging time. We found that DAP nanoparticles exhibit the size-dependent optical properties. The absorption transitions of the nanoparticles at the lower-energy side experience a bathochromic shift with an increase in the particle size as a result of the increased intermolecular interactions, while the higher-energy bands of anthracene split possibly due to the electronic coupling between the pyrazoline ring of one molecule and the anthracene moiety of the neighboring molecule. Most interestingly, the nanoparticle emission in the blue light region from pyrazoline chromophore shifts to shorter wavelengths with an increase in the particle size, accompanied with a relatively gradual dominance of the emission at about 540 nm from an exciplex between the pyrazoline ring of one molecule and the anthracene moiety of the neighboring molecule. The hypsochromic shift in the emission of DAP nanoparticles was identified as originating from the pronounced decrease in the Stokes shift due to the restraint of vibronic relaxation and the configuration reorganization induced by the increased intermolecular interaction.

MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] results demonstrate that the photothermal therapy mediated by GNFs inhibits the proliferation of Hep-2 cells effectively, and the inhibition effect increases with the increased concentrations of GNFs and power of the laser. The results of apoptosis and necrosis tested by flow cytometry demonstrate that the photothermal ablation play a predominant role in suppressing the proliferation of the Hep-2 cells. Such citrate-capped GNFs are expected to be a kind of materials potential useful in tumuor NIR photothermal therapy.

The citrate capped gold nanoparticles presented shape evolution from dot-shaped to tadpole-like, dumbbell-shaped and rod-like along the reaction. It is identified that the preferential growth along {1. 1. 0} facet of the face-centered cubic gold seeds related to activity of the gold precursors contributed to the shape evolution from dot-shaped to tadpole-like nanoparticles at the early stage of the reaction. The tadpole-like particles evolved to the dumbbell-shaped ones due to the reduced growth rate and ripening of the gold nanoparticles. Finally, the dumbbell-shaped particles became rod-like in shape attributed to the intraparticle ripening of the gold nanoparticles. This work implies the possibility to control over the shape of the gold nanoparticles in seeding approach in presence of weak ligands such as citrate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Its corresponding Re(I) complex was also synthesized and studied in detail, including single crystal analysis, electronic structure, photophysical performance, thermal stability and electrochemical property. Single crystal analysis suggested that there was a coordination ability difference between the N atom from pyridine ring and the one from oxadiazole moiety. Theoretical calculation on the complex suggested that the onset electronic transition owned a mixed character of metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer and ligand-to-ligand-charge-transfer.

In this method, doping efficiency of the dyes is usually low (ca. 10%) due to the competitive hydrolysis and condensation of the precursor and TEOS. In this work, we developed a multi-step approach for efficient incorporation of the amino-reactive dyes into silica particles. First, APS was modified on surface of the pre-prepared silica particles and then the dyes were covalently coupled with the amino groups of APS on the particle surface. After further growth of silica protection layer, the dye-doped silica particles showed good colloidal stability, bright luminescence and excellent anti-leaking ability. Doping efficiency of the typical amino-reactive dye such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was as high as 91% attributed to the complete separated hydrolysis and condensation processes of APS and TEOS. Such an approach is also applicable to the preparation of the multicolor dye-doped silica particles by the simultaneous coupling of two or more amino-reactive dyes onto surface of the APS modified silica particles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Glucose absorbed on the particle surface was readily removed by water washing without leading to agglomeration of the Pt nanoparticles. The as-prepared Pt/C electrocatalysts showed improved mass activity for methanol electrooxidation compared to the catalyst prepared without glucose protection.

Taking horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as an example, only 30% of its catalytic activity was kept after being immobilized on the surface of 25-nm Au nanoparticles, mainly attributed to the conformational change of the heme-containing active site. The catalytic activity of HRP was significantly improved to 80% when a certain amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added at the initial stage of the immobilization. Systematic spectral investigation indicated that the addition of BSA inhibited the tertiary structure change around the active site, which was a prerequisite for improved activity of the immobilized HRP. Steadystate kinetic analyses revealed that the introduction of BSA could effectively improve the turnover rate of substrate to product in spite of slight reduced affinity to substrates, which also contributed to the improved catalytic activity. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

Experimental results indicate that the formation of aggregates can be mediated by the electron drawing ability of the substituents introduced for those compounds all bearing strong electron pushing substituent. When the electron drawing substituent is pyridine group, the molecules tend to aggregate in head-to-tail manner, whereas the substituent is pyridinium group, the molecules tend to aggregate in face-to-face manner. The effect of electron pushing and drawing ability of the substituents on the aggregation behavior is further analyzed in terms of frontier orbital interactions.

84888611220	High-purity gold nanocrystal dimers: Scalable synthesis and size-dependent plasmonic and Raman enhancement	We report a method for the solution synthesis of directly-fused dimers of gold nanocrystals, including both homo-dimers (two nanocrystals of the same size) and hetero-dimers (two nanocrystals of significantly different sizes) with high purity and high yield. The first key issue in this seeded solution synthesis was the tight integration of the "reduction" of the precursors to form tiny nanocrystals in solution and "random attachment" of these newly formed tiny nanocrystals onto the tips of existing nanocrystals. The second key issue was to decouple the "intra-particle ripening" from the "reduction" and "random attachment". This new approach was found to be capable of yielding different types of dimers by judiciously tuning the time sequence of "reduction", "random attachment", and "intra-particle ripening" in one synthesis. UV-Vis absorption measurements unambiguously demonstrated a two-band feature for the resulting high-purity dimers, indicating strong plasmonic enhancement due to the formation of "hot spots" within the dimers. The two-band absorption spectra of the dimers were further found to be strongly size dependent and intra-particle distance dependent. Consistent with the observation of the formation of "hot spots" by absorption measurements, very strong and size-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering was observed for these high-purity, directly fused, and stable dimers of gold nanocrystals. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

At pH 3.0, DNA can be absorbed effectively on the positively charged particle surface by direct electrostatic attraction. The adsorption capacity could be as high as 1.8. mg DNA/mg NPs under this pH. At pH 9.0, DNA can be eluted almost completely from the negatively charged particle surface. Such a simple approach to fabricate charge reversible particles switched by pH not only has potential applications in highly efficient DNA extraction, but also could benefit the study on the interactions between proteins and DNA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Additional optimization in film thickness, NC surface chemistry, and the shapes of materials are expected to result in further improvements to the photocurrents.

84907761074	Controlled formation of gold nanoflowers by reduction of tetrachloroauric acid with thermally treated glucose in alkaline solution	Herein, thermally treated glucose in alkaline solution at 60. °C for 10. min was used to reduce tetrachloroauric acid for the preparation of gold nanoflowers within the size range of 50-520. nm. The use of the glucose activated for a longer period of time led to the formation of gold nanoparticles with less anisotropic characteristics. The degradation of glucose in alkaline solution results in enediols and carboxylates. It was suggested that the product has stronger reduction ability and limited protection effect for tetrachloroauric acid and gold nanoparticles, respectively, contributes to the controlled formation of gold nanoflowers. The as-prepared gold nanoflowers showed better surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity than citrate or PVP coated ones when rhodamine 6G (R6G) was used as probe molecule.

0442264186	Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic study on the interaction of hepatitis B virus surface antigen and its monoclonal antibody	Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been employed to study the interaction of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) with mouse monoclonal antibody against HBsAg (Ab-HBsAg) . SERS is used to obtain spectra of HBsAg, Ab-HBsAg and their immune complex adsorbed on colloidal silver. It is found that Ab-HBsAg is bound to silver colloids through the carboxyl groups, which are not on the antigen binding site of the Ab-HBsAg. The vibrations from tryptophan residues of the HBsAg disappear after formation of the immune complex. It is assumed that the tryptophan residues are among the antigen active sites of the HBsAg and play an important role in the interaction between Ab-HBsAg and HBsAg.
