84944715653	Evidence-based multicasting fault diagnosis agreement with fallible processors	The Byzantine agreement (BA) problem has been widely discussed in the literature concerned. Most BA protocols can reach a common agreement by way of fault masking. However, in a highly reliable fault-tolerant distributed system, just reaching a common agreement is not enough. We need to take into consideration another related problem called the fault diagnosis agreement (FDA) problem. The goal of solving the FDA problem is to make each fault-free processor detect/locate the common set of faulty components in the distributed system. We shall solve the FDA problem with the dual failure mode over a multicasting network system. The proposed FDA protocol can detect/locate the maximum number of faulty components with the dual failure mode to solve the FDA problem in a synchronous multicasting network.

84948760921	Reach reliable decision by using secret agreement method	Traditionally, it is very important to deliver data secretly and at low cost in a distributed environment. Using a reliable method to assist in communicating with each other needs to be discussed. Thus, we propose the two-phase agreement (TPA) protocol to solve those problems by verifying the received messages and achieve the agreement. The TPA protocol will assist the organization in achieving agreement and generate a common key to verify it. Similarly, there are many faults and attacks in the network, such as interruption, interception, modification and fabrication. The messages from a source might be changed. However we can use the TPA protocol to remove these faulty influences. The proposed TPA protocol doesn't only decrease the complexity of messages but also increases the capability of fault tolerance. Similarly, it is more reliable via the secret key in a real distributed system. This protocol can solve the agreement problem in net-meeting between arbitrary processors, like sub-company communication with the main-company or makes a decision in the company conference.

19944366549	Asynchronous Consensus protocol for the unreliable un-fully connected network	In order to achieve reliability in the distributed system, we need a mechanism to enable the system as a whole to continue to function despite the system has some faulty components. The Consensus problem is for the fault-free processors to cope with the faulty components and reach a common value from each other in the distributed system. Traditionally, the Consensus problems were solved in the synchronous network. Subsequently, Chandra and Toueg solved the Consensus problem with crash faulty processor in the asynchronous fully connected network in 1996. In this paper, we will solve the Consensus with dual failure mode (both crash fault and malicious fault) on communication links. The proposed protocol uses the minimum number of rounds of message exchange and can tolerate the maximum number of allowable faulty communication links to make each fault-free processor reach a common consensus value.

19944375828	Grouping Byzantine Agreement	The reliability of the distributed system has always been an important topic of research. Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol, which allows the fault-free processors to agree on a common value, is one of the most fundamental problems studied in a distributed system. In previous works, the problem was visited in a fully connected network or an unfully connected network with fallible processors. In this paper, the BA problem is reexamined in a group-oriented network, which has the feature of grouping, and the network topology does not have to be fully connected. We also enlarge the fault tolerant capability by allowing dormant faults and malicious faults (also called as the dual failure mode) to exist in a group-oriented network simultaneously. The proposed protocol is more efficient than the traditional BA protocols and can tolerate the maximum number of tolerable faulty processors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

19944414891	Reaching agreement on an unknown network with partial graphic information	The Byzantine Agreement (BA) is an important topic in the reliable distributed system because the system can cope with the influences from faulty components when the agreement is achieved. In the literature concerned, the BA problem has been well formulated in a Fully Connected Network (FCN) and a Generalized Connected Network (GCN) under the assumption that each processor in the network has the common knowledge of the graphic information about the entire network structure. However, in the real world, each processor may not have the common knowledge of the graphic information about the entire network structure. That is, the processors may only have the partial knowledge as to their own graphic information. In this paper, the Byzantine Agreement problem will be visited in an Unknown Network (UNet) to increase the capability of fault tolerance by allowing faulty processors with dual failure mode. The proposed protocols, the Unknown Agreement Protocol (UAP) and the Relay Channel (RC), use the minimum number of rounds of message exchange and can tolerate the maximum number of faulty processors allowed.

2342580235	The new territory of mobile agreement	The fault-tolerance is an important research topic in the study of distributed systems. To cope with the influence from faulty processors, reaching a common agreement at the presence of faults before performing some special tasks is essential. Therefore, the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem has drawn more and more of the researchers' attention as they explore deeper and deeper into the world of distributed systems. Traditionally, the BA problem is solved in the fully connected network or in the broadcast network. However, the technology of network continues to grow at high-speed, it promotes the wireless and mobile computer to become increasingly popular. It can also provide support for mobile computing. This environment encourages distributed system design and practice to support mobile processors greatly. The mobile network is different from the fully connected network or broadcast network; processors in mobile environment have high mobility. The processors may immigrate into or move away from the network at any time. How the processors reach an agreement in the mobile network must also be concerned deeply. In this paper, BA problem is reexamined under the mobile network. The proposed protocol Byzantine Agreement under Mobile Network (BAMN) uses the minimum number of message exchanges to reach an agreement while tolerating the maximum number of faulty processors in a mobile environment. It makes all the healthy processors reach a common value to keep the system from the influences of processor failures. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33645220495	Achieving high efficient Byzantine agreement with dual components failure mode on a multicasting network	Under many circumstances, reaching a common agreement in the presence of faulty components is the central issue of fault tolerant distributed computing. So the Byzantine agreement (BA) problem has become more and more important in distributed systems. Traditionally, the BA problem was visited in a fully connected network (FCN), broadcasting network (BCN) and generalized connected network (GCN). Subsequently, malicious fault assumption with processors or communication media was extended to a hybrid fault model on both processors and communication media. However, the network structures (topologies) of FCN, BCN and GCN are not practical. In this study, we lighten restrictions of the network structure to revisit the BA problem with multicasting network (MCN). The proposed protocol uses the minimum number of rounds of message exchange and can tolerate the maximum number of allowable faulty components to make each fault-free processor reach a common agreement in an MCN.

33645234904	Byzantine agreement under dual failure mobile network	Networks are trending towards wireless systems that provide support for mobile computing. The Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocols used in static networks do not perform well in a dynamically changing mobile environment. Mobile commerce and related applications are necessary for wireless networks. There are numerous properties in a wireless network that play important roles. For example, the processors in a wireless network have highly mobile capabilities. Processors can immigrate into or move away from the network at any time. Although mobile technology has brought greater convenience, it is comparatively more dangerous. Wireless systems are susceptible to security flaws such as attacks by hackers. The number of allowable faulty components within the system is also decreased. To increase the number of allowable faulty components and ensure network security, a simple, secure and efficient protocol, BAM, is proposed to handle the BA problem. The fault symptoms include malicious and dormant faults. Furthermore, the proposed protocol uses the minimum number of message exchange rounds to make all healthy processors agree on a common value and can tolerate the maximum number of allowable faulty components. The proposed method will also ensure message security and increase the system's fault tolerant capability. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33751413124	A hybrid load balancing policy underlying grid computing environment	In recent years, network bandwidth and quality has been drastically improved, even much faster than the enhancement of computer performance. The various communication and computing tasks in the fields such as telecommunication, multimedia, information technology, and construction simulation, can be integrated and applied in a distributed computing environment nowadays. However, as the demands of many researches for computing resources gradually grow, Grid Computing integrated with a distributed computing environment and the Internet (network) has gained more attention. The so-called Grid Computing is to utilize the idle computing resources (nodes) on the network to facilitate the execution of complicated tasks that require large-scale computing. In other words, the composition of Grid resources is dynamic and varies with time. Thus, when selecting nodes for executing a task, the dynamic of the nodes in the Grid must be considered, and to exploit the effectiveness of the resources, they have to be properly selected according to the properties of the task. This study proposed a hybrid load balancing policy which integrated static and dynamic load balancing technologies to assist in the selection for effective nodes. In addition, if any selected node can no longer provide resources, it can be promptly identified and replaced with a substitutive node to maintain the execution performance and the load balancing of the system. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

33845195630	Streets of consensus under unknown unreliable network	Generally, tasks in a distributed system, such as two-phase commitment in database system, the location of a replicated file, and a landing task controlled by a flight path finding system, must reach an agreement. This type of unanimity problems is called the agreement problem and one of the most fundamental problems in the field of distributed environment. It requires a set of the processors to agree on a common value even if some components of the system are corrupted. There are many significant studies about these problems in a regularized network environment such as Fully Connected Network, Broadcast Network, and Multicast Network. Nevertheless, it is computationally infeasible to ignore the network structure in a real environment In general, the network topology varies with time. Thus, this kind of uncertain network will generate unknown network environment and affect the system to reach a common value. In this paper, the agreement problem will be revisited in an Unknown Network. Simultaneously, Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used to help system to recognize the network, structure. Subsequently, the proposed protocol, Unknown Network Protocol (UNP) can reach an agreement that uses the minimum rounds of message exchange and can tolerate the maximum number of faulty components.

Siu, Chin and Yang have indicated that the bound on the number of allowable faulty processors in Meyer and Pradhan's scheme is an overestimated one, and they have given a new fixed bound to the allowable faulty processors. However, we find out that the new bound for the allowable faulty processors by Siu et al. still seems to give the scheme too much credit. In this study, we shall give a more accurate estimation to the bound of the allowable faulty processors.

33947138071	Visiting Byzantine Agreement underlying Ad Hoc environment	The Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) has become more popular because the MANET is a self-organizing, self-configuring, and an instantly deployable multi-hop wireless network that responds to application needs without any fixed infrastructure. Moreover, the MANET is fault-tolerant and reliable. A mechanism is needed in the MANET that allows a set of nodes to agree on a common value. The distributed Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem is one of the most important issues in designing a fault-tolerant system. In many cases, reaching a common agreement among fault-free nodes in coping with the influence from faulty components is crucial in a fault-tolerant system. When a common agreement is achieved, all fault-free nodes in the system can produce stable results without any influence from the faulty components. In this study, the BA problem is visited in a MANET, in which the components are subject to a malicious fault. The proposed protocol can tolerate the maximum number of allowable faulty nodes using a minimum number of message exchange rounds. Each fault-free node can reach a common agreement value for the BA problem in a MANET. © Nauka/Interperiodica 2007.

Over the years, a number of solutions to consensus problem have been proposed with varying assumption of the network structures. However, most existing consensus protocols are designed for random networks. Recently, many large complex networks have emerged and displayed a scale free feature, which influences the system to reach a different common value. Unfortunately, existing consensus protocols and results cannot cope with the new network environment and the consensus problem thus needs to be revisited. The proposed protocol is called as the Dual TM Protocol (DTMP), which can make each correct processor reach a consensus value to cope with the faulty component in the scale free network.

However, reaching consensus is not enough in a high reliability application. Therefore, in this study, the fault diagnosis agreement is visited. The proposed protocol does not only reach an agreement for healthy processors but also detect and locate the faulty components in a synchronous unreliable network. We also enlarge the fault tolerance capability by allowing both dormant faults and malicious faults exist in a network. That is, the proposed protocol can tolerate, detect and locate the maximum number of faulty components with the dual failure mode to solve the consensus problem and fault diagnosis agreement problem in a synchronous distributed environment by minimum number of rounds of message exchange.

Therefore, from the viewpoint of the business, how to meet market requirement has been an important issue. In order to meet market requirement and to develop different marketing strategies, the market segmentation proposes to explore the opportunities of the target market. The method of market segmentation generally includes "consumer preference," "distribution channel," "geographical analysis," and so on. However, previous research on marketing only focused on some fixed point, and those were lack a set of systematic analysis process. In addition, the corporate decisionmaking analyses are mostly collected from the history data. An information system is used to obtain the factors and to conduct market research with those factors. However, the dynamic market requirements will either obstruct the decision-making or affect the appropriateness of the analysis results. In this study during the selection process of the marketing, the products information and previous marketing experience or data are used to first analyze and then to find useful, unobvious, or ineffective methods of marketing. Moreover, the results are selected, mixed, and saved in the marketing database. Finally, the information on marketing activities is presented. In addition, based on the market response, consumer behavior, click-through rate, and other feedback mechanisms, the related information on marketing activities is transferred to the required information that needs to be stored in the marketing database. The study provides not only an advantageous way of finding proper marketing strategies but also an effective method of transforming feedback mechanisms.

Therefore, those nodes will affect the stability of network topology because of clustering and de-clustering, and continuously make reconfiguration for the groups of network, all that will influence the overall function of network.

69249235555	Towards a hybrid load balancing policy in grid computing system	Grid computing has become conventional in distributed systems due to technological advancements and network popularity. Grid computing facilitates distributed applications by integrating available idle network computing resources into formidable computing power. As a result, by using efficient integration and sharing of resources, this enables abundant computing resources to solve complicated problems that a single machine cannot manage. However, grid computing mines resources from accessible idle nodes and node accessibility varies with time. A node that is currently idle, may become occupied within a second of time and then be unavailable to provide resources. Accordingly, node selection must provide effective and sufficient resources over a long period to allow load assignment. This study proposes a hybrid load balancing policy to integrate static and dynamic load balancing technologies. Essentially, a static load balancing policy is applied to select effective and suitable node sets. This will lower the unbalanced load probability caused by assigning tasks to ineffective nodes. When a node reveals the possible inability to continue providing resources, the dynamic load balancing policy will determine whether the node in question is ineffective to provide load assignment. The system will then obtain a new replacement node within a short time, to maintain system execution performance. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

70350506606	A variable control integrated service framework for Mobile TV and IPTV	Mobile video services have become more convenient for people's mobility. However, they are limited in the quality of the video. People have become accustomed to watching videos being played on bigger displays, such as televisions. IPTV is a system that provides digital television service by using Internet Protocol over a network infrastructure. Although the two kinds of video services are applied in different contexts, the processes of service transfer are less convenient when the user changes their environments. In this study, a "VCIS-TV" framework based on distributed processing is proposed, in which a mobile video service can be integrated into an IPTV service via context transfer and handheld devices can continue to serve people with a cooperative remote control service. This involves cooperation between different devices and services since these devices and services aid people in different contexts. In the VCIS-TV framework, people can easily make good use of handheld devices in a mobile video service, cooperative video services, and remote control services in a smart home.

74949107803	Achieving high efficient agreement with malicious faulty nodes on a cloud computing environment	The reliability of the distributed system has been an important topic of research. Agreement protocols, which allow the correct nodes to agree on a common value, have been brought up to aid the reliable execution of tasks. In previous works, fully connected networks, generalized connected networks or multicastinge components were proposed to solve the agreement problem. Recently, a new concept of distributed computing, cloud computing, is proposed to provide several services. The cloud computing that can make more application for user from the internet. Unfortunately, existing agreement problem and results cannot cope with the new computing environment and the agreement problem thus needs to be revisited. In this paper, a new protocol is proposed to adapt to the cloud computing environment and derive its bound of allowable faulty components. Copyright © 2009 ACM.

77956616604	Achieving efficient agreement within a dual-failure cloud-computing environment	Fault-tolerance is an important research topic in the study of distributed systems. To counter the influence of faulty components, it is essential to reach a common agreement in the presence of faults before performing certain tasks. However, the agreement problem is fundamental to fault-tolerant distributed systems. In previous studies, protocols dealing with the agreement problem have focused on a fully connected network or on a general connectivity. However, cloud-computing, an Internet-based development in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet has become a significant issue. In a cloud-computing environment, the connected topology is not very significant. Therefore, previous protocols for the agreement problem are not suitable for a cloud-computing environment. To enhance fault-tolerance, the agreement problem in a cloud-computing environment is revisited in this study. The proposed protocol is called the Dual Agreement Protocol of Cloud-Computing (DAPCC). DAPCC achieves agreement on a common value among all nodes in a minimal number of message exchange rounds, and can tolerate a maximal number of allowable faulty components in a cloud-computing environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77958564453	Efficient clustering mechanism for WiMAX network	WiMAX is a technology based on IEEE 802.16 standard that enables the delivery of last mile wireless broadband access as an alternative to wired access such as cable or DSL. WiMAX can provide mobile wireless broadband connectivity without the requirement for direct line-of-sight with a base station. With the development of wireless network, WiMAX has the characteristics of long transmission distance, wide coverage, high speed, multiple bands, and support of multi-media. In an environment with large population, the network may become unstable and broadcast storms because of interferences from excessive communications when too many users are using their mobile devices for communications. A Three-Layer based WiMAX network topology (TLWiMAX) is proposed to address the scalability of WiMAX in order to reduce packet collisions and rapid energy consumptions by excessive broadcasting. By doing so, the Iifecycle of the device can be extended and the network made more stable. © 2010 IEEE.

The cloud computing, an Internet-based development in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet has become a significant issue. The cloud computing refers to a class of systems and applications that employ distributed resources to perform a function in a decentralized manner. Cloud computing is to utilize the computing resources (service nodes) on the network to facilitate the execution of complicated tasks that require large-scale computation.

79751526958	A new territory of multi-user variable remote control for interactive TV	Unlike passive analog TV, interactive TV (iTV) is the next step toward interactivity that offers users a friendly interactive experience. As there are fewer studies focused on multi-user interaction in a local environment, we concentrate on multi-user interaction with families, especially within a home information system. Therefore, we propose a control service framework "MVC-iTV," based on distributed computing and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, in which external displays (TVs or projectors) and handheld devices can be used for controlling iTV services by several members of the family at the same time, without any relocation. Further, the new remote control framework can free users from the restrictions of using one remote controller. The experiment results indicate that the MVC-iTV framework is applicable to the iTV service and that users can operate the service in any visible environment via wireless networking technologies. Besides, requirements of the hardware compatibility of the TV appliance and remote controller will be reduced in the MVC-iTV framework. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

0345374633	Efficient multicasting agreement protocol	The fault-tolerance is an important research topic in the study of distributed systems. To cope with the influence from faulty components, reaching a common agreement at the presence of faults before performing some special tasks is essential. Therefore, the Byzantine agreement (BA) problem has drawn more and more of the researchers' attention as they explore deeper and deeper into the world of distributed systems. Traditionally, the BA problem has been visited in a Fully Connected Network (FCN), BroadCasting Network (BCN) or Generalize Connected Network (GCN), making the malicious fault assumption with processors or communication media grows into the dual failure mode on both processors and communication media. However, the network structures (topologies) of FCN, BCN and GCN are not practical nowadays. In this study, we shall take a close look at the limits of the network structure to revisit the BA problem with a Multi-Casting Network (MCN). FCN, BCN and GCN are all special cases of MCN, so the new protocol we shall propose here will also be able to solve the BA problem with FCN, BCN and GCN structures. Our new protocol uses a minimum number of rounds of message exchange and can tolerate a maximum number of allowable faulty components and make each fault-free processor reach a common agreement in an MCN. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In a distributed system, cooperating tasks must achieve an agreement. This is to cope with the influence of faulty components. Reaching a common agreement in the presence of faults before performing certain tasks is essential. Nowadays, network bandwidth and hardware technology are developing rapidly, resulting in the vigorous development of the internet.

However, this algorithm does not perform well in dynamically changing networks. To enhance fault-tolerance, a new protocol VSACS (virtual subnet agreement of cloud storage) is proposed to solve the BA problem in this study. VSACS uses the minimum number of message exchange rounds to make all correct processors agree on a common value and can tolerate the maximum number of allowable faulty components.

Determining how to utilize the resources of networking to reach the objective of cooperative computing has remained an important topic in recent years. In addition, with the great advances in technology of the Internet, Peer-to-Peer (or P2P) computing has gradually become the mainstream of distributed applications; it not only provides enormous resources for complicated computing that a single computer cannot solve, but also integrates resources more effectively. A P2P architecture relies primarily on the computing power and bandwidth of the participants in the network rather than concentrating the work in a relatively limited number of servers. P2P architectures typically are used for connecting nodes via large-scale connections. The topology is useful for many purposes. Furthermore, every joint in a P2P computing system has its own resources. Determining how to take the different characteristics of every joint set into consideration for loading assignments is an important topic. However, in this study, a three-phase scheduling algorithm under P2P architecture is advanced. The proposed scheduling algorithm is composed of BTO (Best Task Order), TOLB (Thresholdbased Opportunistic Load Balancing) and TLBMM (Threshold-based Load Balance Min-Min) scheduling algorithm that can better utilize executing efficiency and maintain the load balancing of system.
